         That the House expresses its deep regret at the death, on Tuesday 7 January 1992, of Ian Alexander Christie Wood, Senator for the State of Queensland from 1949 to 1978, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service.

        Ian Wood was born on 31 January 1901 at Mackay, Queensland. This remarkable gentleman devoted over 50 years of his life to public service in both local and Federal government.

         Ian's career in government began in his late twenties when he became an alderman. He then went on to become Mayor of Mackay, and was purported to be the youngest mayor in Australia at the time. He was elected Mayor of Mackay no less than five times, serving for 15 years in all. Other achievements in the area of local government included being elected President of the Australian Council of Local Government and President of the Queensland Local Government Association.

         His election in 1949 as a Liberal senator for Queensland began a career in Federal politics which was to last almost 29 years until his retirement in 1978. During that time he served on several committees, the most notable service being his chairmanship of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Ian chaired that Committee for over 20 years. His enormous contribution to the Committee remains a feature of his time in Federal Parliament.

         Ian will be remembered as a highly principled man who worked unstintingly for the people of Australia. His capacity to talk with people at the grassroots level and his obvious honesty and integrity made him a popular choice with the people. His re-election at every poll until his retirement was evidence of this.

         His time in the Senate was not always smooth sailing.

Nonetheless, he fought for what he believed was right and was a worthy representative for the State of Queensland.

         Ian Wood was something of a rebel and a non-conformist whose life reminds us of how politics has changed. He was elected in the 1949 Menzies landslide and he left Parliament 29 years later at the height of the Fraser era. He was a man of strong and unambiguous views who made few concessions to the changing times. He never smoked or drank and refused to take a drivers licence. The distinguished senator, well into his seventies, was a familiar sight cycling around his home town—something I am sure the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) would no doubt commend to us all.

         If some of his views now seem quaint, a few of them are particularly relevant. He noted way back in 1971 that the appointment of assistant Ministers—I trust the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) will forgive me for mentioning this—was just a ploy by the Prime Minister to expand his power base.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I was particularly struck by an old press clipping which recorded the senator making a $500 donation to the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck) in recognition of the courageous attitude of the honourable member in standing up to the Government. There was only one problem with this: the honourable member for Franklin was attacking Senator Wood's own government at the time.

         If Ian Wood was sometimes the Liberal Party's resident rebel, he could also be a tactician of genius. In 1974 Prime Minister Gough Whitlam desperately needed to secure a majority in the Senate. Gough's brainwave was to appoint the DLP Senator Vince Gair as Ambassador to Ireland so that six Queensland seats would be contested at the forthcoming Senate election. But Ian Wood was too smart for Gough Whitlam.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Senator Wood turned out to be more familiar with constitutional law than did E.G. Whitlam, QC. He knew that if the Queensland Government issued its writs before Gair had resigned, Gair's seat would be filled as a casual vacancy by the Queensland Government and Labor would be denied the probability of a third Queensland senator. Senator Wood immediately phoned the Queensland Premier to urge him to issue the writs. There was only one problem: how to stop Senator Gair from resigning before the process was complete.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This is where the teetotal Wood showed his true colours. He knew that Gair, a man who had just ratted on his Party, was feeling pretty lonely so he rang his fellow Queenslander, Senator Ron Maunsell, and had the affable Maunsell detain the gregarious Gair over beer and prawns in Maunsell's room. Hence, the legendary night of the long prawns which derailed Gough's plans to seize control of the Senate and ultimately led to the 1974 double dissolution election.

         —I support the condolence motion before the House in respect of the death of former Senator Ian Wood and would like to add three other matters to the discussion. Firstly, Ian Wood was one of those people who served in local government both before and during their period in the Federal Parliament, and as such was akin to people such as the former member for Kennedy, Mr Bob Katter, who was a very determined and dedicated servant in the local government area for the Cloncurry township. In the same way, the late Ian Wood served as mayor and as a councillor for the Mackay area for a period alongside the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite).

       <para first-indent="16">

         I think that local government experience in Queensland gave a certain definition and focus to his service in the Senate which prompted him to study those minutes, ordinances and regulations and led him on to his key role as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) points out correctly, he helped to lead the Senate down the path of extending and expanding its committee work.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The second thing I would add is that, in many ways, Senator Ian Wood was ahead of his time in respect of building up the tourism industry of north Queensland and of the beautiful Mackay-Proserpine-Bowen area. Just two weeks ago, I had the privilege of travelling with the honourable member for Dawson from Mackay to the Abbot Point coal loading facility to the north and studying some of the tremendous facilities and resources of the coal and sugar industries and also the tourism industry along that section of the coast. Undeniably, former Senator Ian Wood saw the real potential of the Proserpine area, the Mackay area, the Whitsunday Passage and the islands. He set about doing something about it and I think we should commend and salute that aspect of his work.

         Finally, I mention that 21 years ago the good Senator Ian Wood saw fit to highlight the then controversial tour of Australia by a South African sporting team and to support that particular team. I am led to believe he had a foreknowledge and was well enough to understand that the South African cricket team was to arrive in Perth later this summer. It is, of course, now to play tomorrow night in Sydney in an historic match.

         He was known as the cycling senator. One of the ironies of his contribution to this place is that in I think 1963 he opposed the then Government's proposal to increase sales tax on motor vehicles. As a result of that he was known in Mackay as the cycling senator. But he was prepared to stick up for principles and, as somebody said—and particularly on that issue—he was always a bit of a pinprick in the side of the Government. Of course, the people who do that are never destined to take ministerial leather and his lot in life was to be a backbencher. But he did make a great contribution through the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, where he established some type of landmark which went from Australia right across the Westminster system.

         Ian Wood was elected in 1949. I understand that the only surviving Senate forty-niner is John Gorton, so we are seeing the passing of an era. In public administration, Ian Wood was an alderman at the age of 26, mayor at the age of 29, President of the Queensland Local Government Association for six years and also of the Australian Local Government Association. He served on the Mackay Port Authority and was present to open Mackay's first airport in 1930. I believe it would have given him some sense of satisfaction to be present when the new airport was opened last year. He played his part as a parliamentarian, in public administration and also in business. What is remarkable is that he performed these three functions all together.

         Ian Wood was always interested in Mackay. He promoted tourism when it was a word that nobody else knew. As a result, the Whitsundays, Mackay and surrounding areas became known on the national and international calendar. He thought very much of Mackay. He used to describe it as the sweetest city in Australia, no doubt reflecting not only on the sugar industry but also on the manner in which Mackay presented itself to the rest of Australia.

         His interests included the sugar industry, the coal industry and the arts. Out of his own purse he sponsored many artists to come to Mackay. One of his last testimonies to the city was parkland given in his mother's name, the Annie Wood Gardens. He participated in his travel agency until just before he was hospitalised prior to his death. He took an active interest all the way through.

         Ian Wood was born a Presbyterian and died a Presbyterian. That might be the mark and the calibre of his stubbornness and the principles that he adopted through life. It is sad to reflect that, for his nearly 91-year contribution to this Parliament and to Australia, he was never officially recognised for an Imperial or an Australian award. Just 17 days before the Australia Day announcement that he had been awarded the Australia Medal for member of the General Division, he died. I believe that before that medal is announced there must be the approval of the individual who is to receive it, so perhaps he had the satisfaction of knowing that he had been so rewarded.

         It could be claimed that, being Mackay born, he was the most successful of the sons that it has reared. While his memory will live on here, there is no public memorial to him in the city of Mackay or the State of Queensland. But his memory will remain in the archives of this Parliament, in the archives of the local government that he served so well and also in the minds of those of us who knew him. To us all, he remains a person who had great ability, great vision for the State and the nation, and great integrity.

         —I would like to add a few words in commendation and memory of a great Australian. I knew Ian Wood in many ways. I knew him perhaps first when I visited Mackay as Minister for Social Services to open a Presbyterian aged persons home. I had known him vaguely in this place, but until that date I had not realised the tremendous effect and impact that his service in local government had had on the development of Mackay. Mackay is a beautiful city in north Queensland. It is a community that owes a great deal to Ian Wood, for there he served not only as a senator but, as has been recorded, as mayor over many years. In every way he was a great contributor to the people and to the place.

         In this place I came to know him through his membership and long term chairmanship of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. One of the problems of this place—and we are all beset with it—is the product of time. There is so little opportunity to go through the actual nuance of each of the details of legislation that passes through this or the other chamber, and even less time to pursue the regulations. It was through the work of Ian Wood, Reg Wright and one or two other noble souls in the Senate that it began to be apparent that we were far too casual in the way in which we adopted regulations and legislation—that is, policy aside, without regard to the impact on individuals in the community of the words of those regulations and ordinances. In that sphere, I think Ian Wood played an outstanding role—one which I am pleased to see has been continued to the present day. I would like to pay particular tribute to the way in which he pioneered that work on behalf of the interests of humanity and the rights of ordinary Australians in ensuring that legislation did say what was intended.

         I now talk about Ian as a man. He was a cyclist, a bachelor and a strange individual in so many ways. Yet when one got to know him, one found he was rich, living and a great contributor. As those who preceded me mentioned, he was certainly a pioneer of tourism in north Queensland. His own travel agency, which he maintained throughout the period during which he served in local government and in the Senate, was one which I am sure attracted many of the early visitors to north Queensland. Of course, this was long before north Queensland became a favourite destination.

         There are legends about Ian, some true and some untrue. It was suggested that he was the person who made Justin O'Byrne President of the Senate. This was vehemently denied by Ian himself but someone on the other side of the Parliament certainly did. My view of history is different from that of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) because I think the credit for the debacle with respect to Gair belongs to Lionel Murphy, not Gough Whitlam. Those who were here at the time would be aware of that, especially if they are on the Labor side of politics. I think the credit for the constitutional wisdom belongs to Odgers rather than to Ian Wood, although Ian Wood was the person who seized on and understood the importance of what he was being told.

         Ian Wood was one of those people who served in this Parliament for a long period. He served well enough to justify re-election on every occasion on which he sought re-election. That in itself is a tribute because it is necessary, if one is going to be a senator under the proportional system or a member in this place, that those people who choose candidates—who decide who will and will not continue—are satisfied with the performance of the person concerned. Ian Wood obviously was a legend in Mackay and justly so. I pay tribute to him. I am just sorry that he does not have anyone to whom we can convey those condolences.

         We have heard reference today to his association with the development of aviation and tourism in north Queensland. That is very true. He was one of the leading proponents of aviation for the more remote areas of Australia. In 1929, as my colleague has said, as Mayor of Mackay, he opened the first Mackay airport. I last spoke to Ian Wood last year with the opening of the new Mackay terminal. He was still quite lucid for his 91 years and was absolutely delighted that at last Mackay had a decent facility to welcome what he hoped would be international services into that city in the not too distant future.

         May I also say that Ian Wood should never be underestimated in terms of his development of the Whitsunday islands. Not many people know that he was a confidant of the late Sir Reginald Ansett. It was on the advice of Ian Wood that Ansett bought Hayman Island when it was first developed as a major tourism resort in that particular district. He had at heart the interests of all Queensland, but he had a special place for the Whitsundays, which he often described to me as the most magnificent destination in the world. I am sure that I speak on behalf of not only my Liberal Party colleagues from Queensland, but also many hundreds of people within the tourism industry who would like to pay their respects to Ian Wood, a truly remarkable man.

He was seen almost as the epitome of a senator. I think he deserved that because he contributed so much to that parliamentary institution.

         Those opposite are smarting at the fact that the business community is prepared to talk to the Government about Australia's long term issues and is prepared to face the real problems we have with the recession and coming out of it. They want them simply to go mouthing political slogans from the Liberal Party. If this is how the Leader of the Opposition thinks policy should be made, without consultation, without regard for the people who create wealth or run employment in this country, then I think he is very sadly mistaken. He simply tries to push the business community into being lackeys of a partisan political organisation.

We handed that to the private sector of Australia and said, `Here is $30 billion a year; go and spend that on investment'. That is what we did. It was often spent on investments which were not productive; it led to a call in overseas savings that we could not abide; imports spiralled to levels which the current account could not tolerate; and there was pressure on the inflation rate—nonetheless, we did the correct thing and tried to pull the nation's living standards—

That, compounded by a withdrawal of credit around the world, not just in Australia, and a recession and a slowdown in the economies of the United States, Japan, France, Britain and Canada, amongst others, produced for us lower prices and lower national wealth.

         But we will do with this recovery what we did with the recovery left from the recession you left us; that is, we will get on with the growth. I do not remember any contrition from the honourable member for Bennelong when he went into opposition in 1983, leaving us with a massive structural Budget deficit, 10 1/2 per cent inflation—not 1 1/2 per cent—just on 11 per cent unemployment, a smashed profit share and smashed investment. I do not remember any acts of contrition by the then member for Wentworth in any of the columns he was writing. No, he slunk off back to private life and left us with the wreckage, which we then turned into 1.5 million jobs; we pulled the structural Budget deficit into surplus; we pulled the inflation rate down for the first time in two decades; and we preserved from 1983 to this day 1.5 million jobs against the paltry 350,000 in your period. They ask what they can expect from us. What they can expect from us is the kind of recovery, growth and employment that they had in the 1980s coming out of the wreckage that we were left with.

         —I thank the honourable member for his question. The Government has, of course, been monitoring the supply of credit in Australia and, of course, this has been done in the context of a deregulated financial system where the measures of credit have changed significantly and the ability to affect the supply of credit has also changed significantly. Whereas in the regulated financial system, with which our opponents are much more familiar, the Government can more directly affect the supply of credit, in the deregulated system it cannot do so nearly as directly. The Government has been concerned about ensuring that in the context of an emerging recovery—a recovery which the Government intends to further encourage—there is an appropriate response from the financial system to ensure that there is sufficient credit available to support that recovery. In the consultations which the Government undertook earlier this year there were a number of points put to us by companies, both large and small, about the availability of credit in Australia, and some observations were made about the conduct of the banks.

I am delighted to say that the banks have, in the context of those discussions, welcomed the Government's plans to provide some stimulus to the economy to promote economic activity, and they have said that their lending policies will be fully consistent with the Government's objective of trying to encourage such a recovery. They have reaffirmed their keenness to lend for sound commercial propositions. The chief executives went on to say that they would reinforce this policy with their lending staff. Later today I will be issuing a statement which contains the sentiments endorsed by the executives of the four major banks who came to see us.

We recognise that they have been going through some difficult times, but with an emerging recovery—a recovery we wish to bring on and promote—this is not the time for us to continue to criticise the banks and their conduct; rather we should ensure that the banks have the capacity to provide the credit necessary to encourage the recovery of the Australian economy.

We had demand running at 9 per cent and we had product at 4 1/2 per cent. In other words, 4 1/2 per cent was being taken as imports. What we were seeking to do was to bring down the 4 1/2 per cent to meet GDP; that is, to cut demand back and not to slice into production. The fact is that for a number of reasons we could not fine tune that process. But we have had a cut in production. We have lost about $12 billion in production.

When I became Treasurer in 1983, GDP was $171 billion, when I resigned as Treasurer it was about $405 billion, and we lost $12 billion from $405 billion. We went from $171 billion to $405 billion minus $12 billion. But what sort of growth did you have? There was no doubling of nominal GDP in your time. You gave us a permanent recession, the most miserable rates of growth. Of course, do not mention that. You can mention that we chopped into GDP after we crossed the $400 billion barrier, but never mention the fact that you only got up very slowly to $170 billion by 1983. The fact is you were grossly incompetent and had no idea how to manage the place. The slowdown did turn into a recession, and that is very much to be regretted. The only thing to do now is simply move it back to recovery as quickly as possible.

I tell you what—by God they are. But what really let the cat out of the bag at this conference was Dr Chris Murphy—the econometrician who put together the model on which the GST was based and tested—saying in a paper that GDP would be reduced for at least five years as a result of the consumption tax and that unemployment would be higher for at least five years. He went on to say that if the price surge was not completely locked out of wages, GDP would be 4 per cent lower after five years and unemployment would be increased by over 2 per cent.

         —Some of us, Mr Speaker, have both content and weight. In this case, the Opposition's document misses out on the content side. The GST package envisages—though none of the dancing claquers on the back bench of the Liberal Party comprehend it—a period of sustained high levels of unemployment. The Opposition sits there and hypocritically questions us about our attitude to the question of unemployment, when it is understood by those who devised that package that it contemplates—and relies upon for its success—sustained unemployment. Falling real living standards will result from its implementation. That is a feature of it. When Opposition members comprehend that, they will know the genuine hypocrisy that has been forthcoming in their questions.

         But there are some interesting features of the document,  nevertheless. In circumstances where the Opposition contemplates continuing unemployment, it has to deal with the problems of the unemployed. What is there to deal with in the problems of the unemployed?  Not an understanding that many of those are out of work because of structural changes, many of which the Opposition may well want to implement or expand on, were it to get into office; not a comprehension that unemployed persons are breadwinners.

         It is a sort of 1980s moronic attitude that says the unemployed are essentially undeserving. Therefore, after six months, the unemployed will be required to obtain from businessmen certification that they are actively seeking work. In this package two sets of people are monumentally persecuted: one is small business and the other is the unemployed. In this element of the package they both get hit. In requiring approximately 500,000 job seekers to have written certification from two employers each fortnight, a total of 26 million written certifications from small businessmen and others will be required each year in order for this element of the package to be implemented.

         Let me say this:  if things go wrong for this side of the House some time next April, or May, or June, or whenever this election is held, my strong advice to anybody who is silly enough to have opened an office anywhere near a CES establishment will be to get that business at least a couple of miles away from the CES office because they will receive some visitations. Those businessmen will be required to provide two certificates for each person who comes in seeking work.

         Of course, one assumes that this certification does not take place by some automatic process. One assumes that the process involves some level of interview, discussion or whatever it is. Let us take a conservative estimate that a six-minute discussion takes place between the person seeking certification that he asked for a job and the person writing the letter to say, `Yes, indeed, this fellow asked for a job'. That means that some 1,824 person years per annum would be provided by employers for this process. My Department estimates the cost of this process for employers—not for the Government or taxpayers—to be $72m each year.

         Presumably, not all people are in a situation where they can actually walk to the employer to get that certification; they might have to take a bus ride. So let us take an estimate of $1.50 per trip—a concessional metropolitan transport cost. The estimated cost to job seekers comes out at about $39m each year. This is the cost that would be imposed on the unemployed and then on the businesses to be persecuted by the unemployed as they seek certification under the wonderful proposals put forward by the Opposition.

         —One of the many quality structural changes which the Government has brought to Australia over the last nine years has been that relating to superannuation. One has to acknowledge that when we came to office, only 40 per cent of the work force had any superannuation coverage. Many of those workers, of course, were in the public sector. Those who were in the private sector were overwhelmingly in management or other executive positions. This did not concern the Liberal Party of the 1970s or the early 1980s. It saw the superannuation arrangements and its preferred treatment through the tax system as the legitimate right of those people who were on high incomes and not something which should be accessible to those on lower incomes, the overwhelming majority of the work force.

         The Government set about the task of trying to produce a change which not only had an important social dimension but also had an important structural change, in terms of providing an incentive to add to savings, and also of trying to encourage people to provide more for their own retirement. Therefore, the Government, with the trade union movement, set about the extension of award superannuation by making changes to the taxation system, which focused superannuation benefits on retirement provision, and, of course, by making the system fairer to extend the access of Australian workers to superannuation.

         We now can reveal that by July of last year nearly 80 per cent of working men and women in this country had some superannuation coverage—that is, from 40 per cent, highly skewed towards the public sector and higher income groups, to 80 per cent, which is a much more general coverage of Australian working men and women. We intend, of course, to continue our progress and the extension of superannuation generally, partially through the introduction of the superannuation guarantee levy, which will ensure that those who have an award requirement actually comply with it and will also ensure that over time superannuation provision is extended.

         It is in that context that one has to view the proposals of the Opposition in relation to superannuation. Firstly, it should be recalled that the Liberal Party has never liked the idea of superannuation—has never liked the idea of extending superannuation to ordinary working men and women in Australia. This was something which was not supposed to be available to them.

         The Liberal Party has promised simplicity, yet its proposals involve enormous complexity, which would be an administrative nightmare, particularly for those who are involved in defined benefit schemes. Its proposal would increase the cost of running superannuation schemes, thereby reducing the benefits that would flow to employees in retirement. It would increase the tax on superannuation funds. It would increase the risks carried by employers, especially those who have defined benefit schemes. It would drastically curtail, and do so retrospectively, an individual's freedom to choose to take a lump sum benefit.

         Once this proposal was made available, of course, not surprisingly it met with significant criticism from the superannuation industry. So we are seeing a process of scuttling, a process of duckshoving on the part of the Opposition, as it tries to work out what it is going to do with this crazy mess that it has created after months, if not years, of agonising.

          Australian Financial Review
         </emphasis>
         that he had set up a consultative group of four or five superannuation and actuarial experts to review the details of the policy. On the basis of the evidence produced by the Minister for Finance, not only have we seen that there is a $4 billion hole punched right through the middle of the Opposition's proposals, but we are also now seeing the wheels fall off this particular part of the Opposition's proposals relating to superannuation.

         Mr Speaker, have you observed how sensitive members of the Opposition have become to any criticism and to any suggestion of a review of their policies? Those who criticise their proposals are accused of simply representing vested interests, as the Opposition leader said in response to some criticism from the superannuation industry in this regard; they are dismissed as being ignorant; or, in the case of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, they are accused of being liars if they suggest in any way that members of the Opposition are about to review their policies. But review they will and review they must because the policies which they have proposed are terribly complicated and would have entirely contradictory outcomes if they were to be pursued.

         What we are seeing here is the beginning of a process which will continue over time as more and more of the Opposition's proposals are subjected to greater and greater scrutiny and as more and more of the weaknesses are revealed. Little by little, bit by bit we will see this policy fray. We will see the wheels fall off until we are left with only one thing—a central piece of irrationality; that is, a tax on the clothing and food of every Australian in this country.

The fact is that not only are you not guaranteeing wage arrangements, but this week the Leader of the Opposition said that he will oppose any national wage adjustment. In fact, he is in dispute with the honourable member for Bennelong over the matter. Members of the Opposition have no wage arrangement between themselves, much less between themselves and the work force.

         The result is this: although given tax cuts which are worth half of the proceeds of the consumption tax—and if one is on the low end, of course, one gets much less than people on the higher end of the income scale—why would the workers who have been belted with a consumption tax accept such an impost and say, `Yes, that is all right; we will give you a wage discount. We will keep the inflation rate at 2 or 3 per cent'? Of course they will claim it in wages! And what will you do about it? Put out a press release? Poke your tongue out outside your office? What will you do about it as inflation starts whirring up to 10 per cent?

         Yet after labouring for a year to bring forward this mouse which will actually reduce GDP and put our inflation gains at risk, you are on about 1988 and the outcome of that Budget and the Budget forecasts then. This is 1992. We are about moving into a recovery; we are about preserving low inflation. Yet you produce a proposition which reduces GDP and risks blowing inflation back into double digits. God!

         Now let us have the facts. The first point to make is that the proportion of the population today dependent on welfare is less than it was in 1983. Despite the great growth of the aged population in this country and despite the difficulties of the recession, the proportion of the population on welfare today is less than what we inherited from the present Opposition. Let me just give the figures.

         —For the noisy interjector over there who wants the facts, we have over four million people getting some form of security help at the moment. But the proportion of the labour force who are recipients of social security today has declined from 41.9 per cent in 1983 to 35 per cent in June 1991. Now let us take the population. The proportion of DSS recipients has fallen, if we take the population figure, from 19 per cent in 1983 to 17.4 per cent in June 1991. I stress that that has occurred despite the severity of the present recession and despite great growth in the aged population.

         Why has it been achieved? We inherited from the Opposition a loose, overpopulated, untargeted social welfare system and my predecessors have produced a structured and targeted system in this country, correcting the inept controls over fraud that characterised the Opposition's period. We have been able to turn those arrangements around. Again today we spend approximately 7 per cent of GDP—gross domestic product, for the member for Franklin—on social welfare.

         Let me exemplify some of the real increases that have taken place under this Government because we have managed to have a targeted welfare system: payments for children in low income families have increased in real terms in the nine years of this Government by 52 per cent for children under 13 and by 121 per cent for teenage children; payments to sole parents with between one and four children have increased by around 16 per cent in real terms, and if one takes in our increases in rent assistance by about 24 per cent. The basic pension rate has increased in real terms by almost 12 per cent under this Government, and rent assistance has increased by between 78 per cent and 137 per cent. We have created real living standards for those who need social security payments, but because we have targeted it, we have been able to do it within much the same budget in proportion to GDP as in 1983.

         No man was prouder of the recession that he created than the present Prime Minister. It is without parallel in the history of any Western industrialised country that somebody who sends a nation into recession should actually boast about the achievement of creating that recession. Yet that is fundamentally what this man did. Not only in 1988 and 1989, but all through his long stewardship as Treasurer of this country the present Prime Minister boasted about everything that he did. Therefore it passed very strange, and indeed it passed very poorly to us, and I am sure to the Australian people, that when the Prime Minister was first asked a very important and fundamental question in Question Time today by the Leader of the Opposition—if you got it so wrong in the past, why should the Australian people believe you tomorrow night?—he replied, `Yes, we are in a recession, but it is all the fault of the rest of the world. Every other country is in recession. We are not alone. We are just part of the mob. We are no better, we are no worse, than anybody else'.

         Of course, that was not the boastful honourable member for Blaxland way back in September 1985 when he was Treasurer of this country and he was boasting about his achievements as Treasurer. He said, `If we were providing these policy settings and outcomes in western Europe they would be lighting candles to us in cathedrals'; in other words, they would be honouring his handiwork by lighting candles in cathedrals. That was the measure of the man's truculence. Of course, we all remember what happened on 23 August 1988 when he said that this was the Budget that was going to bring home the bacon.

         Let me try to predict what the Prime Minister is going to say. I think he might well say, `I can report to the people of Australia that the nation is successfully emerging from its most severe economic crisis in a generation'. It will be quite surprising if he does not say that. He will go on and say, `Australia has continued to grow and we are now well on the way back to prosperity. We are now systematically restructuring the economy, making Australia a much more dynamic place'. He likes that word, `place'. He keeps using it time and time again. He says, `I want to get the place cracking. I want to make it a far more dynamic place, more able to compete in the world. The evidence is there for all of us to see'. Then he will go on and talk about how the balance of payments is improving.

The only problem with using that kind of rhetoric is that that was basically the rhetoric he used on 23 August 1988; in fact, in his Budget Speech he said, `I can report to the people of Australia that the nation is successfully emerging from its most severe economic crisis in a generation'. He said that in August 1988. Yet he knew that lying before us was the worst recession that this country has had for 60 years. This man craves acceptance as the reformed, born again believer in employment, as a man who believes in sustained economic growth, and as somebody who, despite all the accumulated evidence of his prime complicity in the destruction of jobs in this country, would have us believe tomorrow night that he is born again and that he now understands things that somehow or other escaped him over the last 8 1/2 years.

         Therefore I invite the Parliament and the Australian people to look at the contribution of tomorrow night's statement to the most tragic legacy of all of the current recession, and that is our very high rate of unemployment. We have the highest rate of unemployment since the great recession, the worst level of jobless for 60 years—in other words, the worst level of jobless probably in the living memory of anybody in this Parliament without exception. That, uniquely, is the sort of legacy that the honourable member for Blaxland, the man who tomorrow night will ask us to accept him as the saviour of the Australian economy, has delivered to the Australian community.

         If there is one issue that will haunt the Australian Labor Party until the next election, it is the issue of unemployment because, if ever there was an issue on which those opposite claimed uniquely and specially to have a compassionate concern for their own constituency, it is the issue of unemployment. It has been an issue on which a Labor man or woman could be ignited into indignation, fury and self-righteousness. One can look back through the speeches of Labor Party leaders over the years, be it Hawke or Whitlam. I remember Whitlam saying that 2 per cent unemployment was a national crime—the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) nods in assent—when he campaigned in 1972. Two per cent unemployment was a national crime, according to the former member for Werriwa who was a Labor Party leader.

         I remember the former Prime Minister, the former member for Wills, saying that any party that was responsible for the levels of unemployment that obtained in the early 1980s did not deserve to be in office. Yet we have watched those levels of unemployment climb. We have seen youth unemployment in this country go to 34 per cent despite the fact that the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), in a press statement that he made a few weeks ago, would have us believe—incredibly—that the level of unemployment amongst young people was only 8.8 per cent. That claim was made by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and, despite the invitations from a number of my colleagues, he has done absolutely nothing to explain that extraordinary proposition.

         That is where the Fightback program of the coalition comes in. It is a program which is dedicated to a sustainable reduction in the number of unemployed in our community—a program which through, for example, its abolition of the payroll tax, is designed to remove impediments to job creation. It contains a commitment to micro-economic reform; a commitment to freeing up the industrial relations system; a commitment to a genuine reform of Australia's waterfront and Australia's transport system; a commitment to the introduction of a good and services tax which is exporter friendly and which is designed to place Australian exporters on a competitive footing, so far as taxation is concerned, with the exporters of other nations—and to do something that I have no doubt that every businessman who saw the Prime Minister in his consultations over the past few weeks told him ought to be done, which is to give to the Australian business community an indirect tax system that does not automatically place us at a disadvantage compared with exporters of other industrialised countries.

They remember that he was the bloke who boasted about how it was necessary to do something about the effervescence that was flowing over the glass. He was the bloke who said that the Australian economy was like a bucking bronco and had to be subdued—subdued by the bludgeon of massively high interest rates. He was the man who through 1988 and 1989 boasted about the pain that he was inflicting upon the Australian economy. We have the outrage of the man now posing as some sort of born again saviour of the Australian economy, yet he will go down in history as the only Treasurer this nation has ever had who actually enjoyed inflicting pain on the Australian people.

         —The honourable member who has just spoken, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), has this to his credit:  he is one of the very few members of the Opposition who admit that the package which it has brought down will not bring down the high levels of unemployment at any time in the calculable future. In hope, he says—through his assertions about what might take place on micro-economic reform—that maybe in four or five years from now, the GST package will have some sort of impact. But how, we do not know; it is magical. Maybe it will have some sort of impact on the levels of employment, but it will not, within a normal parliamentary term, have any impact on high levels of unemployment.

         At the outset let me concede that the levels of unemployment are too high. The consequences of high levels of unemployment on the lives of individual Australians are unacceptable. We have a very deep concern for those families in which the breadwinner cannot find work. At least our public policies deal with problems that families confront when the breadwinners are unemployed. None of that was said by the honourable member who just spoke. I believe that he omitted to say it not because he lacks compassion—he is a man of very considerable compassion—but because in this particular instance, whether by virtue of his own fault or that of his colleagues, he is a man without policies.

         As far as the living standard or the life of the average person who is unemployed is concerned—it is anticipated that were the Opposition to be elected to office, under its policies a large number of people would continue to be unemployed—all there is in the Fightback package is a reduction in the level of benefits, making benefits harder to obtain and setting utterly absurd tests with an enormous potential impact on businesses that are approached by unemployed members of the work force. That is all there is in the Opposition's contribution.

         In the Opposition's package all the training programs that have been put in place by this Government have been removed for the purpose of attempting to make the taxation figures in the package add up. One of the problems of the advocacy of the honourable member for Bennelong, as he pursued it for 10 or 15 minutes, and of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) when they say that what will improve this country is a program of micro-economic reform, be it on the waterfront, in transport, in the labour market or wherever, is that they say that if we are to avoid the sorts of situations which the Prime Minister referred to in Question Time in dealing with the assessment of the fellow who did the figuring for the goods and services tax and in which he predicted about four years of falling growth, or four years of recession,  and if we are to have a turnaround, micro-economic reform and changes in the structure of the labour market are critical.

         Unfortunately, we know nothing—or, at least, very little—of what the Opposition would intend from this in the Fightback package that it is pursuing. There are two reasons for that. Firstly, that package is about taxation. It is not about growth, productivity or jobs;  it is fundamentally about taxation. The second reason—this will be very difficult for  the Opposition to handle—is that there are certain things that can be improved in the micro-economic reform area by changes in work practices and changes are going through. Those opposite can argue about the speed at which they are going through, but they cannot argue that they are not going through. They are. That is attested to not simply by Government Ministers but by those who are responsible for the operation of those enterprises.

         The problem is that eventually those Opposite will come up against an unbreakable barrier in the micro-economic reform area. That unbreakable barrier is that element of our infrastructure—be it transportation, waterfront reform or wherever—which is required to be addressed by expenditure. Various estimates have been put out from time to time of the shortfall in the development of Australia's national infrastructure;  but they are all in substantial dollars. The simple fact of the matter is that substantial dollars cannot be fitted into the propositions of the Liberal Party.

         One great area of confusion in that Liberal Party document is what will be done about road taxation and consequent road funding. Those opposite have various propositions. One can read into them, in a subterranean way, that they intend that the States make up the shortfalls that will occur in road funding under their propositions, the States to make up the shortfalls through extreme registration fees, in some instances upwards of $2,000 per annum for a person to put the average car on the road. Under the Fightback package that is what it will cost to proceed with the road program that the Government now has in place.

         It is an area which the Opposition has to keep opaque.

It sits foolishly in the totality of the package;  but it must sit there, at least in obfuscation, if the Liberal Party is to be able to keep its National Party colleagues on board. As a result of that, the Opposition produces irrational policy.

         Let us look at the current situation as far as unemployment is concerned in historical terms. When the honourable member for Bennelong went out of office as Treasurer, in March or April 1983, I think it was, the unemployment rate was 10.1 per cent. In January 1992 the unemployment rate was 10.3 per cent. It is true; it is 0.2 per cent higher. Of course, the inflation rate, as the Prime Minister said, is about 1.5 per cent and about 2 per cent or 3 per cent over the year, whereas during the period when the honourable member for Bennelong presided over it, it was in double digit figures.

         Another comparison is worth while here. The participation rate in the work force is now 63.4 per cent, compared with 60.4 per cent in April 1983. If the present participation rate fell back to the April 1983 level, the unemployment rate would be as low as 6 per cent.

         In contrast, under Fraser the labour force participation rate fell from 62.7 per cent in November 1975 to 60.4 per cent in March 1983. The highest it ever reached in the so-called resources boom was 61.5 per cent. We do not make too much of this. When I am obliged to comment on the unemployment statistics—as I am from month to month—I try not to make too much of the participation rate. It would not be a bad defence for someone in our position who wished to make a point about that to point out the fact that we are sustaining a very much higher level of employment for a larger number of people who want to participate in the work force.

         The reason why we do not is that there is no sense in doing a simple comparison of statistics. If people want to work and cannot get work then they are entitled to be considered as being unemployed. So the fact that since we have been in office more people, as a percentage of the community, have wanted to work is in no small measure a product of the success of our other policies, not least that of job creation. Since we have been in office we have encouraged people into the work force by the very fact that there are opportunities to enter it.

         Since we have been in office, some 1.5 million people have joined the work force—an increase of 23 per cent. These figures have not been knocked back by the period in which we now find ourselves. Over the same period of time when the Opposition was in government the level of job creation amounted to a bit more than a quarter of that. So it was not an era in which people were being encouraged to join the work force by a government's success in job creation. Of course, we have been a government successful in job creation and we have created a much higher level of participation.

         We have also been successful in other areas. We have produced a work force more attuned to the idea of participation in the work force through the success of our training programs, labour market programs and education programs. The reason why the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), who is sitting next to me now, said that 8.8 per cent of young people are out of work is that it is 8.8 per cent of that age cohort to which he referred who are out of work.

The challenge of bringing it down from 12.3 per cent to 8.8 per cent is the product of two things: firstly, the very substantial success that we have enjoyed in encouraging young people to continue their schooling; and, secondly, the enormous increases that have taken place in the provision of places in post-secondary education.

The figure which was quoted by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services was the product of a very much lower number of people in that age cohort being available for work. When the honourable member was in office—I would not stand by this figure, but it was something of this order—about 450,000 people in that age bracket were available for work. I think the figure is now about 280,000 or 290,000.

         The problem that we and this nation confront involves those in an older age bracket who are finding themselves out of work for many reasons—some of them reasons such as successful implementation of micro-economic reform programs. There is no question at all that when the work force is restructured and multi-skilled employers need fewer employees, those whom they do not need find themselves out of work. That is a very substantial problem and it is not an easy one to solve. It means that one of the things we will have to watch very carefully when coming out of this recession is the situation of the long term unemployed. They will be of a different character.

         The simple fact of the matter is that the programs we have put in place are programs which genuinely protect the existing living conditions of the unemployed and, through training, offer them opportunities to get themselves back earlier into the work force, thereby eliminating some gluts and blockages that may well occur as the recovery gets under way. Above all—and this will be evident tomorrow night—we are committed not to leaving unemployment at high levels for the foreseeable future but to bringing unemployment down and, at the same time, advancing the micro-economic reform agenda of the Government.

         The honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) saw unemployment in areas of his electorate rise by 70 per cent between September 1990 and January this year. The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), the Minister for increasingly explaining away unemployment, saw the number of jobless in the Haymarket area of his electorate increase by some 116 per cent between September 1990 and January 1992. I suppose there will be some awareness on the other side of the House that in the former Prime Minister's electorate in the suburb of Coburg we saw the number of jobless increase by 126 per cent over that same period.

         The failure of this Government has been quite devastating to enormous numbers of Australians—young, middle-aged and elderly—who, as the Minister conceded, are increasingly seeking work to ease the enormous financial pressures which this recession has placed upon them. Amid the personal tragedies of the Keating unemployment disaster, none is more tragic than the unemployment amongst young people. I think Australians will be disgusted by the efforts of the Government to manipulate statistics in an attempt to explain away what they see with their very own eyes and, increasingly, what they fear will happen to them.

         Over one million Australians, many of them young Australians straight out of education, do not have the basic skills needed for long term employment or even to function effectively as citizens. The levels of attainment of Australian students in key areas such as science have declined over the term of this Government relative to those countries with which we have to compete internationally. Successful export industries increasingly depend on the ability to speak fluently the languages of the countries to which we export. Language skills amongst Australians have declined dramatically from the 1960s to the present time. This Government has adopted no strategy to deal with that.

         I will comment firstly on the school situation, because that is where the retention rates have exploded. Labor's agenda for the schools has had precious little to do with making sure that young Australians have the knowledge and the skills that will give them jobs through this decade. Throughout this Government's term in office, it has capitulated to its mates in the radical teacher unions and refused to undertake any systematic monitoring of standards, while employers have been appalled year after year by the lack of basic skills too many students—not all, but too many—are bringing out of the schools. The Ministers have denied that there is a problem at all. They do not want to know about it because they know that they will tread on a few corns of people too close to the inner circles of the Labor Party if they try. The Government's agenda has had a lot more to do with creating powerful mega-unions than it has with the ability of the schools to pass on to students the skills that they need.

There are 100,000 qualified people trying to get into TAFE who cannot find places. The Minister says, `Well, of course, you should not worry about that. That is all right because the higher education sector has now reached its optimum size'. How does he know? How can he and his bureaucrats possibly know whether this is the optimum size for Australia?

That is a serious problem not just at the higher education end of the scale but also in TAFE. I think this Government has denigrated TAFE throughout this whole process of educational upheaval.

         Throughout today's Question Time, and in some of this debate, those opposite have been referring to various aspects of this Government's performance since 1983. I will do that also, but I think we should look at the starting point.

         In 1982-83 there were approximately 6.3 million people in work in this country. In the four years prior to that, the last four years in which the Liberal-National Government had the opportunity to create some jobs in this country, in global economic circumstances that were nowhere near as difficult as they are now, it managed to create a total of 300,000 additional jobs. In the immediate four years after we came to office, the number of jobs was increased by 700,000, more than double the previous Government's record.

         Another thing that is important to those who are unemployed is the number of job vacancies. It is one thing to talk about how many people are looking for jobs; it is another thing to say how many jobs there are for those who are out there hunting for a job. Looking at the unemployed to vacancy ratio we find that in the Opposition's last year in office—1982-83—there were 34 people looking for every job advertised. In the last financial year there were 20, which is a marked difference. Those figures condemn the Opposition's record as being inadequate in almost every year it was in government on the last occasion. The Opposition did not create the jobs and it certainly did not create an economic climate in which there were vacancies for people who were unfortunate enough to be unemployed. Even in the depths of the problem confronting us now, the unemployed have a better chance of finding a job. There are more vacancies now than there were when the Opposition was in office.

         It is worth making some reference to the predicament of unemployed youth, given that it has been raised in this debate. Fairly free journalistic licence has been given to some of these figures, with talk of 40 per cent of the youth of Australia being unemployed. In broad terms, that figure refers to youth in the full time labour force. As the Opposition knows but refuses to recognise, despite the protestations of the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) a moment ago, the number of young Australians now staying on in education has doubled in the life of this Government. We now have a situation where the majority of the youth of this country—15- to 19-year-olds—are not in the full time labour market; they are in the education and training system.

        —I wish to advise the House of the retirement on 31 January this year of Mr Hillas MacLean, Parliamentary Librarian since December 1982, and to extend to him the Parliament's appreciation of his services. Mr MacLean joined the Parliamentary Library in 1979 as Deputy Parliamentary Librarian after distinguished service in New Zealand, which included the position of Chief Librarian in the General Assembly Library in Wellington. He was promoted to Head Librarian in the Parliamentary Library in 1980 and Acting Parliamentary Librarian in 1981. He was appointed Parliamentary Librarian, the head of the Department of the Parliamentary Library, in 1982.

        During his career with the Parliamentary Library, Mr MacLean presided over a number of important initiatives. These included: the 1983 proposal that the Library provide, on behalf of the Commonwealth Parliament, assistance to parliamentary libraries of the developing nations of the South West Pacific; the introduction, following the general election in 1984, of detailed library specific orientation sessions for senators, members and their staff—these sessions have been of great value to very many senators and members as well as being of considerable benefit to the Library itself; the development and implementation of the Parliament's information, storage and retrieval—ISR—system which is used extensively by members of both sides of the House; and the formation in 1986 of a departmental council, through which management and staff could exchange views and information on a wide range of matters.

        During Mr MacLean's term of office, the Library responded to a number of changes and developments which added to its workload and responsibilities. The increased number of senators and members following the 1984 election led to greater demand for the Library's services and required a rearrangement of resources to ensure that the Library's high level of client service was maintained.

        A particularly complex and difficult project during this period was the planning and implementation of the Library's move from the provisional Parliament House to the new building in 1988. That year also saw the culmination of a very successful aspect of Australia's Bicentenary celebrations:  the Parliament's bicentenary publications project. The Library was involved with both book publishing and an oral history project.

In the many years he has been in Australia I have found him to be a fine person to deal with, as well as a very efficient administrator of the Parliamentary Library.

         In the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), three aspects of primary industry are involved: wheat, meat and national water resources. When one looks at the farm situation generally in Australia and at the recession that the rest of Australia is suffering, one has to use the word `depression' for the farm sector. This financial year, which still has several months to go, will see the worst or lowest income ever recorded by the farm sector in the history of this country. We are not just talking about something that occurred back in the 1930s; we are talking about the worst financial situation ever.

         According to the recent forecasts of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, the best performing agricultural sector will be the dairy sector, which will record a loss of $8,300 per dairy farmer on a farm business basis. For broad acre farming generally, it will be minus $32,000. If one happens to be an unfortunate woolgrower, it will be minus $46,000. Those negative levels of income in agriculture are unprecedented, and I would suggest they are unprecedented generally for the rest of the Australian community at the present time.

         The Bureau indicated that there will be some pick-up in those average incomes in the next financial year. We have seen some signs already that that will occur, and that is very good as I think everybody would want to see it happen as much as possible. But I make the point that although there is talk about a pick-up, for some, particularly grain growers, it could be December before any positive cash flow will be seen. In other words, a farmer would have to plant a crop, have the weather for it to grow and then harvest it before there would be any positive income. In the meantime, the farmer will need to borrow even more than he has already to plant that crop. For an individual producer this could mean $80,000 or $100,000.

         The matter has been discussed and debated considerably by the wheat industry in particular. The banks, the Government, and the coalition parties, on behalf of those hard-pressed farmers, have been involved in these discussions. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has rejected the wheat industry's request for a particular form of underwriting which would give banks the necessary confidence to lend that extra money.

         Tomorrow night we will hear whether there will be any type of crop loan provision within the economic statement through part B of the rural adjustment scheme, whether it will be a just sum in relation to the Minister's promise that something will be done to assist farm credit through the banking sector or whether there will just be some manipulating with respect to the banks and their taxation calculations, having regard to requirements for tax and losses, et cetera, in their farm business loans.

         The banks have indicated that they will certainly do their best to meet those additional requests. The banks say that the level of debt on their loans to farmers over the next two to three months will be up 20 to 25 per cent on any previous level of credit extended to the rural sector in the history of the relationship between banks and farmers in this country.

         I do not share the Minister's criticism of the banks. He was only trying to deflect the legitimate criticism of the industry directed at the Government's own inaction. I certainly say to the banks, as I have said in discussions on a number of occasions with them, that for their own sakes as bankers, with regard to the assets that are mortgaged by them on lending for farms, it is to their advantage, as well as to the advantage of farmers, to ensure that those farmers are allowed to survive. The banks keep saying that they are very much aware of that. I hope that in the next few weeks it will be shown that the banks are playing their part. I suggest it is about time the Government played its part because, as is mentioned in today's paper, it is projected that the price of wheat for this season—wheat being one of the aspects of the Bill we are referring to—is now up another $10 a tonne to $180. That is certainly a good indicator for the future, although one has to acknowledge that the Northern Hemisphere crop is still to come, in the middle of the season, before the final price of the Australian crop is determined at the end of the year.

         I reiterate the coalition's policy with regard to the wheat industry, which is a continuing and a stable policy: part of our policy is a single year underwriting for the wheat crop, determined at the harvest time at 95 per cent of whatever that harvest price per tonne is determined by the usual procedure. Had that been in place earlier, the industry would now have greater confidence and had it been in place with regard to the wheat industry's own continuing policy and requests, instead of jumping from one year to the next for different policies, it would have carried greater weight with the Government in that it is the policy of the alternative government. It is also a consistent policy, which is market-related, was worked out with the grains industry some years ago and would still be of considerable value to the industry at the present time.

With the debate now unfortunately warming up on the Wheat Board's position to maintain the export power—that is, the sole export or monopoly power for wheat exports from this country—I remind everybody, whether in the Parliament or in the industry, that the coalition's policy once again is to retain that power for the Wheat Board.

         It is not only wheat that is looking up; wool is also. In the statement tomorrow night it would be of considerable value to the wool industry if the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) were able to announce a flexible repayment arrangement following significant sales from the stockpile, which in turn would allow a reduction in the wool tax. That would allow about $300m—in other words, virtually next year's requirement of repayment for the Government's loan for wool sold from the stockpile—to be rolled over and to be utilised next year against the repayment schedule. At the same time that would allow a considerable reduction in the wool tax, while allowing a necessary increase in the percentage for promotion from 2 1/2 per cent to 4 1/2 per cent in total for both promotion and research and development, but still have a reduction in total to somewhere below 10 per cent.

         I remind everybody again that in the debate we had in this place in June last year the coalition stated quite clearly that 10 per cent was the maximum necessary for the industry to meet its commitments and to help woolgrowers to stay in business in that very difficult time. The Government started with 15 per cent and finally came down to 12 per cent. I think the figuring of the Government in relation to the wool industry bears considerable comparison with its figures with regard to its overall budgetary provisions, or statements, for this year. The Government gave a certain figure about what the Budget deficit would be this year and now we find that the Budget deficit is going to be about twice as much.

         Another part of this Bill refers to the meat inspectors and imposes penalties on meat inspectors who receive goods or services from the proprietor or owner of the abattoir; in general terms, that means meat.

         I commend the Government for making that a specific offence, but it is only one of the many problems confronting the meat inspection service at the present time. That service is too expensive. I do not blame AQIS necessarily or the individual meat inspectors for that because it has been imposed on the industry as government policy but, as it has been imposed, the Government and AQIS have been too slow to respond to the need to become cost efficient. For example, only in the past few weeks has it become obvious that in Victoria, as part of this too expensive system, seven surplus senior meat inspectors are in abattoirs where there is no longer a need to have that additional level of inspection. We are told they are kept there because they may be needed and it does not cost the individual abattoir any money.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It might be true that it is not costing the individual abattoir any money, but some of the other abattoirs are complaining that they are getting a special benefit because of that. Even on the basis of $68,000 to $70,000 costed out to abattoirs per inspector, it is costing the industry seven times $70,000. That is about $500,000 of unnecessary additional cost. Those seven inspectors are supposedly surplus, but we are told there are 62 other meat inspectors in towns where there is no longer an abattoir who were not required to move to a place where there was an abattoir. We are told they were kept because they `may' be needed in some abattoir somewhere else.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That is separate to the seven senior inspectors, but on top of that, in answers to a questions, it has been admitted that there are 150 surplus meat inspectors, if one goes on the Government's figures. If one goes on the industry's figures, 400 meat inspectors are surplus. That is over 25 per cent when one adds the other extra inspectors that keep coming out of the woodwork at these abattoirs, or perhaps I should say stainless steel if it was an abattoir. Over 25 per cent of the total meat inspection service is unnecessary and is costing the meat exporters of this country $70,000 a time.

         Looking at the part of the Bill dealing with the water resources, I think what has been done with regard to better accountability is sensible. I note that the Murray-Darling Basin Commission is one of the major organisations for water resources and quality in this country. It is a very worthwhile organisation and it has recently released a report on the nutrient situation in the Murray-Darling river system. That release was timely because of the algal bloom outbreak, particularly in the Darling River.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         One has to note that at the time of the outbreak there was a drought and dry weather exacerbates the likelihood of algal outbreaks because the river drops to a lower level, and because of that the water is warmer. That encourages the development of the algal bloom. We all acknowledge and understand that this is a serious situation particularly if it is the toxic type of algal bloom. I want to make a couple of points in relation to it. First, algal bloom is not unique to Australia. In the United Kingdom it is very common in farm dams. The farmers there have their own method of fixing it; they put in bales of straw. It is also not unique to modern agriculture in Australia because the first recorded outbreak of algal bloom in the Darling River was in 1870.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Those who know the Darling River generally know that it is certainly not an area of intense agriculture. It is not an area where fertiliser is applied along the great length of the river. Certainly right at the top of the river this could be so, although I think the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) would want to say that the area is so naturally fertile that there is no need for any to be applied anyway. That is one of the points about the Darling and the phosphate level in it. With nutrients we are talking of both phosphates and nitrates and there is that natural occurrence in the Darling River.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         To put some balance and accountability into this debate, I acknowledge that it is a very complex situation because phosphates can occur naturally, as I have said. Agriculture, particularly when there is a run-off situation either through irrigation, for example, or a wet season, adds to the problem. I make the point that we have had a drought in that area; in a drought there is no run-off. The Murray-Darling Basin Commission in its consultant's report acknowledges that agriculture's contribution to the recent outbreak would be lower than usual because of the dry situation with no run-off.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In addition to the natural factor and agriculture, there are what are called single point entries, meaning regional sewerage authorities. That is where the Darling Downs does come in because Toowoomba and a tremendous number of regional cities such as Canberra, Dubbo, Shepparton and Albury, are along the river. To be fair to the regional sewerage authorities—I have had a number of discussions with them because they feel that they have been accused unfairly—there is a lot of industrial discharge into rivers from the regional cities as well as the ordinary town water run-off. So we have a complex situation. I am pleased we are getting a better balance in the debate and acknowledgment that agriculture is not the only cause. At the present time it is not the major cause.

         Agricultural practices as well as tertiary treatment for regional sewerage authorities and so forth have to be taken into account.

Hopefully they have read that report and will now make more sensible comments.

         This brings me to the Poultry Industry Assistance Amendment Bill, which allows the Commonwealth to obtain costs for court action against 11 New South Wales egg producers who owe $1.7m for the non-payment of hen levies. This came about when there were levies, but levies ceased in 1987. The action has been dragging on for some time. In the Poultry Industry Trust Fund at the present time there is $670,000. This would allow the Commonwealth to take from that presumably something less than—certainly no more than—$170,000 for the pursuit of those non-paying egg producers through the courts because $500,000 has been transferred to the Egg Industry Research and Development Council for essential or very beneficial industry research and development.

         I note the commitment of the Government to pay into the trust fund any money that is successfully recovered, and presumably from that trust fund to the research and development fund so that the poultry industry trust fund can then be closed as was the original requirement when the whole hen levy legislation was terminated. So the coalition parties will not be opposing this legislation. I believe that in the context of the very serious situation facing agriculture today there are some positive things that the Government should be doing to lessen that cost burden on agriculture.

         —The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is an omnibus Bill. It amends the Meat Inspection Act 1983, the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act 1978, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, and the Wheat Marketing Act 1989. It is being debated cognately with the Poultry Industry Assistance Amendment Bill. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) covered quite clearly the full gamut of the Bills. It is a minor set of Bills with administrative amendments to the ones I have mentioned.

         Several amendments are proposed to the Meat Inspection Act 1983. The first amendment to the Act provides for the definition of `authorised officer' to limit the number of such officers to only those people appointed by the Secretary. Currently, the definition of `authorised officer' extends to all officers within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy in addition to those appointed by the Secretary. Secondly, the Bill makes the Act consistent with current criminal law policy of omitting references to monetary penalties where terms of imprisonment are provided for. The Bill also incorporates into the Meat Inspection Act a new offence of authorised officers receiving goods or services from the owner of a prescribed premises without the written approval of the Secretary. In 1991, this offence was introduced into the Export Control Act 1982.

         Section 35 of the Meat Inspection Act 1983 currently prohibits the owner of a prescribed premises from providing goods or services to an authorised officer. This amendment complements that provision by prohibiting the receipt of goods or services by authorised officers, and domestic meat inspection legislation must demonstrate the importance of integrity of inspection staff. That goes without saying. We have certainly come a long way over the last 10 years with regard to cleaning up the meat industry. We well remember the beef substitution scandals and the important role that AQIS has played. I would like to compliment AQIS for the role it has played with regard to quarantine and in ensuring that we have integrity that is recognised worldwide.

         It is interesting to note that the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) said recently in Bowen that there can be no compromise on quarantine. Yet, when those opposite were in government, they had a very shabby record with regard to quarantine. They have attacked AQIS continually. I think they ought to make up their minds and if they do not want to compromise on quarantine, they should put forward some constructive policies. I recognise that in the past the honourable member for Murray has been constructive in some of his inputs on inspection. However, I think that the Leader of the National Party ought to make up his mind. If he speaks to his constituency with one view, he ought to be consistent here as well.

         The first amendment to the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act 1978 transfers responsibility for determining the form of audited financial statements required under the Act from the Minister for Finance—rightfully, I believe—to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. This will certainly simplify administration. The second amendment permits acquittal of program expenditures by the senior executive officer of the State organisation or approved body receiving Commonwealth funds. The third amendment makes the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory eligible to receive assistance under the Act.

         Certainly there is a concern with regard to our water resources in this nation. It is the life blood of agriculture and we have to work very hard as a society to restrict the amount of pollution from all levels. The honourable member for Murray touched on this. It is not just agriculture that has to improve its act; it is also industry and the provincial cities. Many of the ingredients occur naturally in the land. If we do not have decent rains then we do not get decent run-offs and that is when we get a lot of the problems; but it is a big problem.

         I found that in Europe the problem has been exacerbated by the subsidies and the way in which the Europeans have flooded their land with synthetic or artificial fertilisers. Pollution has become a big headache in Europe. Certainly it will eventually have an effect on Europe's productive capacity. It is ironic that Europe's subsidy system of massive handouts will work against it in the long run. The artificial structure is now polluting Europe's environment. Through necessity, it is going to reduce the way in which it can have a productive output. It is important when we discuss pollution that we recognise that it is a global problem. I would like to see many of the people in the extreme conservation movement who focus on negative aspects focus on the world problems and not just those here in Australia.

         Deregulating the egg industry in New South Wales is of concern to me. It is certainly of concern to growers in my State because of the effect it will have in Queensland. Many people who have bought quotas and have made a good living in Queensland are now under threat because of the deregulation in one State. When we have six States with differing views, it highlights the problems we have of improving efficiency in this country. Over the weekend Queensland failed in a referendum to vote for daylight saving. We failed to synchronise efficiencies and economies of scale on the eastern seaboard. We squibbed it by one hour. Many of the people who advocated the view of opposing daylight saving have been consistently criticising the waterfront and micro-economic reform for being too slow, but when it comes to synchronising watches on the eastern seaboard for tourism and commerce and to have one linkage from the top end of Cape York to Melbourne, we squibbed it. As a consequence, that shows how much effort and cooperation we are going to need to get through further restructuring. I am very disappointed.

         The effect of deregulation on the poultry industry in New South Wales has had a dramatic effect on Queensland producers and producers in my area. I am not necessarily saying that deregulation is a bad thing, but when one State does it out of sequence we have a problem. Of course, that goes back to the 1890s when we saw the stitching up of the Commonwealth through factional agreements. We can still see the consequent effects of that today.

         As the honourable member for Murray said, we have the opportunity to be a little more optimistic with outcomes and prices this year. Wheat prices look as though they will improve. Weather, of course, has a big effect, and there is a crunch. I am sure the next speaker, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), understands even better than I, coming from a bigger wheat belt, the effect of the crunch on credit and finances over the last two years. Growers will have difficulty finding enough money to plant a crop in order to get through the next 12 months. I pay tribute to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who is at the table, for the rural adjustment scheme. There has been a lot of criticism of RAS.

In part C, the area where farmers are helped to leave the industry with dignity, there have been 32 applications and 27 have been approved.

         There is no doubt, though, that some farmers have lost their equity. Many farmers are trying to hang on. It is tough. We have to make sure that we get the broader economic position right and try to minimise the effect of a world recession. It has often been said by those on the other side that we have been blamed for the world recession. If Australia, with its 18 million people, created the world recession in the United States and Europe, it has much more power and influence in Zurich and Europe than I know of. The fact is that we are in a world recession. Commodity prices are bad because of corrupted trade markets. The world does not owe us a living. The world is a tough place.

It is unfortunate that in Queensland those in the National Party are still protectionists and for short term advantage at every farm rally run out the old voodoo economy stuff over and over again. They are still structured on the 1920s and 1930s and do it just to get a cheap vote. That is unfortunate, because it keeps farmers in ignorance. Farmers are entitled to know the truth.

It is interesting that the Leader of the National Party went to Bowen the other day. He was a bit worried about the seat of Dawson because we are going to win it at the next election. He stood up and told the tomato growers in Bowen how great the horticultural industry is, and it is. In Queensland it is an industry worth $700m per annum. The National Party is going to put a GST of 15 per cent on our domestic fruit and vegetable industry. That is a $101m tax. That is what it will do for farmers in Queensland. The National Party is also skiting that it will abolish the fuel excise. I would like the honourable member for Maranoa to go to his councils and tell them how they are going to fund roads. He should also tell the truck drivers what they will pay for registration, because one or two things are going to happen: they are either going to be taxed into the ground through road charges or the roads are going to fall apart.

That is putting at risk everything we have worked for since 1986. It is about time that the hillbillies in the National Party in Queensland understood that this country's future and its agricultural future are more important than theirs. They have their rallies in their little hamlets tucked away in their gerrymandered areas, and it is about time that they told the growers the truth, that if we put up tariffs we will see our beef, our wheat, our wool and our sugar sitting on the wharf because no one will buy it.

        It is funny, but the sad thing is that this is one of the leading lights in the National Party. That is the sort of rhetoric that goes across at rural meetings in the bush. When the country task force goes out there, the people get the truth, and sometimes they do not like it because it is hard to cop. That rhetoric is the sort of thing we have to overcome. Until we can improve the intellectual debate it is going to be much harder for people to understand the complexities of world trade.

         —Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I want to touch on the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Poultry Industry Assistance Amendment Bill, which are largely housekeeping Bills. The first Bill makes amendments relating to the unauthorised receipt of goods for services by authorised officers under the Meat Inspection Act 1983, the eligibility of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory to receive assistance under the National Water Resources Act 1978, and the corporate and annual operational plan requirement of the Australian Wheat Board. However, I believe the Bill does beg criticism, particularly in the area of some government policy and the areas it has still failed to address in the matter of AQIS. I know that the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) did refer to this earlier in his speech.

         Only two years ago this Government moved for full cost recovery within the meat inspection industry and it has imposed an added burden on our export industry. It has failed to reform the work practices within AQIS—the sort of work practices that we see widely practised across Australia. We need to talk more about voluntary employment agreements because this country can no longer live by regulation or live by work practices which allow 35 hours of work per week, nine-day fortnights and 17 1/2 per cent leave loading. The impact of that sort of work practice on the meat industry means that even if one gave sheep to an abattoir, by the time they were processed and  the meat inspection charges were imposed, they are still not competitive on the international market. By the failure of the Government to address the reforms necessary in AQIS to make our meat industry competitive we are losing valuable export opportunities, and I will highlight a couple of them as I go through what I have to say this afternoon.

         What the Government has done is add costs on an industry through moving to 100 per cent cost recovery, over which the industry still has no control. I would have thought we would have seen a reform of the inspection regime in AQIS, and we would have seen a lowering of the number of staff required to run AQIS. As we sit here in this Parliament today, six Australian farmers will leave the land. I suggest to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) that if we had that number leaving AQIS each day, we might move somewhere towards getting AQIS efficient. I would probably go a bit further and say that if we had that number leaving the bureaucracy in Canberra each day—I acknowledge that we need public servants; but do we need the number that we have?—we might start to reduce the tax burden on all Australians because it is really taxpayers' money that is used to pay our public servants.

         In my electorate there is a producer of game birds—quail and pheasants. It is a small family owned and run business, with an abattoir. I will give an example of how government regulations make his operation almost totally uncompetitive. He has to pay a veterinary inspection fee of $65 per half-hour when he gets the vet in to inspect the birds being processed. One can get the picture of a small quail, which would fit into the palm of one's hand, costing $65 per half-hour to inspect. Then there is a meat inspection charge of $322 per day and a registration fee of $395 per month. The best that that producer can expect for a quail on the open market, whether in Australia or elsewhere—he wants to access the Asian market and the European market—is about $1.30 per bird. The cost of inspection alone is 37c per bird. Almost 30 per cent of what he could expect on the open market for a quail is taken up in inspection charges. That gives some idea of the level of inefficiency in our meat inspection area.

         I believe that small abattoirs should be responsible for their own quality control, and subject only to random checks by government inspectors. It is a sensible approach. The market would drive it. If a producer were not meeting health requirements, his product would be removed. It would be a case of self-regulation.

         I saw an example of such an operation last year on the Atherton Tablelands. The honourable member for Kennedy should listen to this. There is a mango grower up there who has accessed the Hong Kong mango market. Inspection is self-regulated. If the product does not meet that country's rigid inspection standards, the whole container is taken off and that grower no longer has access to that market. It is a case of self-regulation, and the penalty is that an entire consignment—not just a carton or one or two mangoes in a case, but the entire consignment—is taken off. That is an example of how self-regulation can work. That producer has accessed very successfully the Hong Kong fresh mango market—so successfully that he really cannot supply sufficient quantity. He knows that on the export market it is quality that will sell first; then people will start to talk about price.

         Let us look at the charges imposed on the industry by AQIS. Apparently, a meat inspector earns about $28,000 a year. But the Government, through AQIS, charges the meatworks $65,000 a year for that service. A veterinarian gets about $35,000, but the abattoirs must pay $93,000 for that service. As I said earlier, when the Government moved to full cost recovery it imposed all of those inefficiencies on our export industries. I hope that the Minister is listening to what I have to say and will try to do all in his power to reform this area as quickly as possible. It is the industry that is now paying the bill. I believe that, if you pay the bill, you have a right to a say on work practices and to hire and fire. We need these reforms quickly as they are a matter of urgency.

We have never really had an adequate answer from AQIS as to why it did not accept the Australian Veterinary Association's warning that, as far as it was concerned, there was insufficient evidence to suggest that there was not a disease threat to the Australian pork industry from the importation of pork from Canada. Not only is there insufficient evidence; I believe the question has not been adequately answered. If the Minister has the answer, I would be very happy to have it this afternoon. The Australian Veterinary Association is a body of professional people whose opinion should be respected. We need an answer on this from the Minister.

Producers can send food to the Asian market which has been grown in our summer when it cannot be grown there. Matilda Farms has accessed that niche market: it sends broccoli to Japan at a time when it cannot be grown there. It was with the help of the innovative agricultural marketing program that the company was able to access that market, and I know that it has appreciated the support that it has had under that program.

His is an exciting proposal because he wants to access the beef markets of Thailand and Indonesia. The producer is not after the very high quality beef market; he wants the middle market, the bulk market. The way that he sees of accessing that market and overcoming some of the infrastructure problems that we have in Australia—the inspection services, the taxes on many of the inputs, the fuel taxes on the transport of beef and the processed products and the wholesale taxes on the transport industry—is to go and set up an integrated beef feeding and processing operation in Indonesia and Thailand.

         Those in the processing operation will go to the breeder in Australia and say, `We want a specific type of genetically engineered animal that can cope with the tropics, that will be lean in output and quantity of meat'.

         The product that would be produced in Indonesia and Thailand will access the middle market, not the market for the high quality Japanese ox type of animal which Australia is noted for.

         One of the problems of accessing the markets in Indonesia and Thailand is the level of tariffs to get into those countries. To get feeder stock into Indonesia, a 25 per cent duty is payable. To access that market with middle market meat, a duty of 65 per cent is payable. On top of that a sales tax is payable. All that amounts to about an 80 per cent tax on top of the landed cost of the processed product.

         The best way these people can see to be competitive and to access the market is to produce the live cattle in Australia, take them to the Asian area, to Indonesia and Thailand, and to feed them there. The meatworks operations would be integrated with the feedlot in these countries and the locally produced Australian beef—a tremendous advantage—would be placed on the local markets in Indonesia and Thailand. It would give access to that market which, as we all know, is an ever-expanding market, without these high tariff levels.

I believe it is a proposal which deserves support from the innovative agricultural marketing program which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, I am sure, will be looking at.

         However, in closing, I must say that, whilst this is very much a housekeeping Bill, I would like to see a speeded up reform in the area of AQIS because the inefficiencies within AQIS are taxes on businesses. Inefficiencies are always taxes on businesses. If we are to get Australia's export performance up and running much better than it is, we need to get taxes off businesses. The inefficiencies within our meat inspection services are just that: a tax on an export industry.

This amending legislation enables the Commonwealth Government, pursuant to a strategy evolved after consultation with the Australian egg industry, to make claims against the poultry industry trust fund and so recover its costs in collecting outstanding hen levies.

         I rise to speak to the Bill because the electorate of Robertson is proud of its thriving poultry industry, which boasts 65 large chicken growing sheds, servicing Australia's largest chicken meat processing factory, Chickadee Chickens at Lisarow, as well as a smaller processing plant owned by Inghams at Mangrove Mountain. Let me give the House some indication of the size of the industry. Chickadee employs 550 of my constituents, who process 156,000 birds each week, in turn producing annual sales exceeding $70m. The local farmers benefit from live bird purchases worth $450,000 each week from Chickadee alone. A great deal more are sold to Inghams and other processors. All in all, over 1,000 central coast residents have jobs in the industry, which makes an important contribution to our local economy.

         The New South Wales privatisation-obsessed Greiner Government in 1989 deregulated the egg market in New South Wales, terminating the Egg Corporation and throwing the egg producers in New South Wales to the mercy—and not so tender mercy at that—of the major grocery chains. The industry has recently been under further attack by the dumping of imported dried egg white from the Netherlands, Sweden, Italy and Thailand.

         Similarly, the chicken meat industry is under attack from international dumpers. This crisis has been precipitated by the decision of the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service to consider an approach by the governments of the United States of America, New Zealand, Thailand and Denmark to allow the importation of poultry products to Australia whether they be in fresh, frozen or cooked meat form. I might say that the industry has not had the benefit of a full explanation of the nature of that approach and the reasons given to AQIS for it; nevertheless, that approach is being considered by the Service, which produced a discussion paper. That paper has been responded to in rather serious terms, in concerned terms, by the industry as a whole.

         The industry also commissioned a substantial economic study which was carried out on the possible effect on the poultry and related industries of the suggested importations. That study is entitled the Larkin report and, amongst other things, points out:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        No economic or social benefits to Australia would arise from the revaluation of quarantine restrictions on imported chicken apart from some temporary reduction in retail prices as subsidised foreign suppliers position themselves quickly to gain market share and destroy the base of the domestic industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report goes on to predict a rapid market penetration initially of 20 per cent, and obviously more in due course, by those imports. Many of the foreign producers are huge by Australian standards and are propped up by large government subsidies, particularly in the European Community. Fast food operators such as Hungry Jacks, McDonalds and Kentucky Fried Chicken, which are international concerns and which have very large chicken producing facilities in their own countries, particularly in the United States of America, would no doubt take tremendous advantage of any lifting of the import restrictions to exclude local producers and to introduce their own product from their own country into those huge chains. The effect of the lifting of such restrictions—the industry tells me and I am sure it is right—would be catastrophic for Australia.

         Perhaps the real arguments that should be put before this House today so far as the Australian public generally is concerned do not relate to the catastrophe that would occur to the industry and to the many thousands of people employed in it, but to health considerations for the general public in Australia. The fact of the matter is that a wide range of avian diseases are dangerous not only to the Australian chicken industry but also to the health of Australians themselves. The costs of putting down an outbreak of an avian disease which affects the human population would be counted in hundreds of millions of dollars. It has occurred in other countries, not only in the poultry industry but also in other industries, at huge costs with the destruction of millions of animals and with the subsidies, levies and the like associated with such disasters.

         I make the point that disease controls are invariably looser in foreign countries than they are in Australia. Australia has always maintained the very highest of standards when it comes to public health. Many debates in this place revolve around whether our standards are too high, but no-one would disagree that our standards are not high at the moment—except perhaps the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott).

         The chicken industry is deeply concerned that mycoplasma, Marek's disease, Newcastle disease, avian influenza and bursal disease could be imported into Australia. For example, an outbreak of Newcastle disease for the first time in our modern history—although there was an outbreak during the Depression—would have a devastating effect on the industry. The last outbreak occurred in the 1930s and that resulted from the introduction of uncooked infected poultry carcasses. The import of chicken, even in a frozen or cooked state, could still produce that sort of disease in this country if it is evident in the country of origin.

         The diseases are present in the nations that are now seeking to ask Australia, through AQIS, to lift our restrictions.

That disease has also been evident in the United States of America in other states such as Nevada.

         Perhaps of more concern to Australian citizens is the disease salmonella and the variant of it—there are many variants—called pullorium.

Salmonella pullorium is also present in Thailand, as are virulent strains of the disease IBDV.

         Manek's disease is a big problem in New Zealand and is costing that industry about 6c per bird to protect against its effects.

         The AQIS discussion paper superficially, in my view, deals with the implications for human health of importation. It does consider salmonella enteritis, but seems to be taking the attitude that restrictions need be imposed only if and when a problem arises. That was not the approach taken in the United States of America. It has imposed a total ban on the importation of poultry products from countries which are not free from salmonella enteritis and its variants, as I have already described. The fact is that in all four countries seeking to enter our market classifications of the salmonella strain are evident.

         Another big worry is the antibiotic, antimicrobial and pesticide residue problem which comes from imports. Many drugs, such as chloramphenicol, which are banned in Australia are widely used in the countries which seek to export to our country. The point needs to be made here that poultry from countries which permit the use of any agricultural chemicals that are banned in Australia should not be allowed into our country. If the experts in our industry see fit to recommend to the Government the banning of, and have banned, chemicals that are used in the production of poultry, surely we should not be importing meat from countries where those chemicals are used.

It might be relevant if I conclude by mentioning the egg industry, which this Bill is all about. I praise the Minister. Not only has he been innovative; he has also shown great courage and interest as an advocate of the farming community. He showed tremendous talents in his other career as an advocate of working people in this country and I think the farming community will look upon his time as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy as a time when it had a very fine advocate indeed.

         While this legislation is supported by the Opposition and makes necessary changes, nonetheless it is true that we are all seen as being out of touch with what is happening in urban Australia and particularly out of touch with what is happening in rural Australia. I think there is a certain irony that we should be in this Parliament this afternoon debating an omnibus Bill which proposes amendments to a number of Bills, including the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act. That legislation deals specifically with the way in which the ACT and the Northern Territory will be made eligible to receive assistance under the Act, just as the rest of Australia thinks the ACT—and Canberra particularly—is more out of touch than it has ever been with precisely what is happening beyond its borders.

         The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) made much of the fact that this legislation focuses on what is happening to the River Murray and the Murray-Darling Basin. The irony that I want to highlight is that the dilemma that was being felt in the Murray-Darling Basin in my electorate, even by me as a Murray-Darling Basin irrigator, over the blue-green algal bloom was largely being fuelled by what was happening here in the ACT. Much of the problem being faced in the Murray-Darling Basin is not the result, as was popularly imagined, of what farmers or fruit growers do to irrigation water, and not even the result of the fertiliser load of that irrigation water where it runs down tile drains back into the river carrying phosphorous with it, but the result of sewage ponds located along the river and of Canberra's sewage itself as it flows down the Murray-Darling Basin.

         Before I entered Federal Parliament I was a fruit grower at Waikerie. Even the residents of Waikerie have a less than adequate sewage treatment plant located on the river flats. I think the existence of those plants and the continued support for them by State governments—and I say `continued support' because the State governments are not prepared to adequately fund alternative locations—are an indictment on those governments, regardless of what their political colour may be. A responsibility rests now with the Federal Parliament, as it looks to major employment generation schemes, to consider what it could do for the River Murray flow if it were to relocate these sewage plants. It has been too easy to fall for the line that the farmers are the ones who have polluted the river basin. The reality, as this report shows, is that the population centres inappropriately located along the river basin have been a major source of pollution and ought to be addressed by the government of the day.

         My experience—and some people have heard me say this before—has been that farmers along the river basin, particularly in times of rural crisis, are inclined to use a minimum amount of fertiliser and use it assiduously and astutely so as to minimise the pollution flow they provide. My experience has also been that the application of organic pesticides is at a lower level in horticulture on the Riverland than it has ever been at any other time in the last 20 years. With the possible exception of use on apple and pear home fruit crops, the use of organic pesticides is now almost unknown. The contribution of sewage plants inappropriately located along the river adding to the pollution flow of the river is significant and ought to be addressed by the Government.

         There are a number of other aspects of the legislation before the House. One of them is the Wheat Marketing Act. I want to take up a point or two made by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), because he was very anxious to score a cheap political point about what he saw as the Opposition's attitude to rural Australia. He said, `After all, the Government has reform in hand and wheat growers ought to be celebrating what is clearly now a light at the end of the tunnel because the price of wheat is rising'. What he failed to address was the fact that farmers around Australia are still bearing interest rates of somewhere between 14 and 17 per cent, and some even higher. Those interest rates reflect the fact that the Australian economy is not well and we only attract investment in this country if we are prepared to offer high interest rates.

         Currently we have a situation in which farmers are bearing the brunt of what has been the historic policy of the Government. More than that, the honourable member for Hinkler wanted to simply suggest that there was something wrong with the way the Opposition was preparing to reduce farm costs by introducing a goods and services tax. He said that his experience had been that he had told the tomato growers of Bowen that every case of tomatoes they grew would be significantly dearer as a result of the GST. What he has not been honest enough to admit in this place is the intention of the Opposition, in introducing a GST, to effectively reduce the taxation load borne by every farmer and every Australian.

So every business cost is effectively tax neutral. But did we find that simple statement of fact emanating from the lips of the honourable member for Hinkler?  Of course not. He did not let the facts get in the way of what he thought would be a good argument. The honourable member for Hinkler then said, `If the Opposition rubs out the fuel excise, which it clearly intends to do, where will it find the money to fund roads?'. But did he not tell us that $2.6 billion of the money currently being generated by this Government never finds its way anywhere near roads? That is the money specifically taken from fuel excise, presumably for roads, which never gets there.

Let me make a comment or two about where I stand on tariff reform as a citrus grower who faces the threat of imported Brazilian juice. Ten days ago in South Australia I had the Democrats declaring what a dreadful crime had been committed by the Government and the Opposition because Californian navel oranges were appearing on the shelves in South Australia.

I happen to think that the Minister agrees with that point of view. Uncomfortable as it is, I have to recognise that if I lock out the Californians there is no way that this Minister or anyone else will get me into California.

I did not hear the honourable member for Maranoa calling exclusively for self-regulation. I heard him mention self-regulation, I thought, as a technique for pointing out ways in which the present excessive cost recovery of AQIS could be reduced; that is, it was not put as a monopolised view but rather as a technique for saving expenditure and so reducing the costs borne by every Australian primary producer.

That argument was taken up by one of the major competitors of this constituent of mine. Despite all the confusion of Christmas and all the lethargy that generally goes through the Christmas-New Year period, I had nothing but cooperation from AQIS as it endeavoured to work its way through this exercise in order to be sure of two things:  first, that there was no threat at all to the egg industry or the chicken meat industry in Australia; and, secondly, that what my constituent was seeking was in fact a perfectly reasonable request that it was able to meet.

The intention is to limit the number of these officers to only those people appointed by the Secretary. As it stands, along with those officers appointed by the Secretary, any officer within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy can be described as an authorised officer. The current amendment will also mean that the Secretary can de-authorise officers. Currently, officers of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy cannot be de-authorised. Since the formation of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy in 1987 this wide definition has not really been necessary.

         Importantly, this Bill adds a new offence provision to the Meat Inspection Act 1983. It means that it will now be an offence for authorised officers to receive goods or services from the owners of premises they are inspecting without the written approval of the Secretary. This complements section 35 of the Act, which makes it an offence to provide goods and services to an authorised officer.

         But the meaty part of this change to domestic meat inspection, if honourable members can excuse the pun, is that it ensures the integrity of the inspection staff in this important industry. No longer can they simply get in for their chop with immunity. It also brings the authorisation of domestic inspectors in line with those authorised under the Export Control Act 1982. If we do not have adequate domestic inspection ensuring local standards, we cannot expect to maintain and indeed to develop the full export potential of this significant industry.

         Exports of quality beef and veal to the Japanese and Korean markets is a growth area of real importance to this country and to the cattlemen of my electorate. ABARE estimates show that in 1990-91 Australia exported 733,000 tonnes of beef-veal with a value of $2,500m. All meat exports accounted for $3.2 billion out of a total of $14.2 billion for all rural exports.

ABARE estimates here show that we already provide Japan with 196,000 tonnes of its 481,000 tonnes of imports in 1990. It is estimated that that will grow to 260,000 tonnes by 1996-97. Of course, that should make a lot of the cattlemen in my electorate happy, especially when one adds to that the projected growth in the Korean market from 81,000 tonnes to 115,000 tonnes in 1996-97.

         This omnibus Bill also includes changes to the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act that are designed to improve efficiency of administration. The first amendment transfers responsibility for determining the form of audited financial statements required under the Act from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The second amendment permits the acquittal of program expenditures by senior executives of the State organisation or approved body receiving Commonwealth funds rather than the State Auditor-General. This I think will expedite programs as well as acknowledge the independence of State Auditors-General.

         The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) said there is a high level of cynicism about government programs in this country. Of course, the answer to this charge of cynicism about government programs which is put by the Opposition comes in the coalition's Fightback package: it simply gets rid of government programs. The harsh and crass expenditure cuts in that package would inevitably mean the slashing of most programs now in place to assist rural Australians.

         —in reply—I should say that, whilst the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is an omnibus Bill and covers a lot of the areas that have been touched on, the reality is that few of the issues that have been raised in debate actually relate to the issues in it and in the Poultry Industry Assistance Amendment Bill. I am pleased to see that there is no opposition to the Bills themselves.

         Given that a number of issues have been raised, I think, given the time, it might be appropriate to respond to a number of them. It seems to me that three areas have been constantly raised in this chamber. The first area concerned issues associated with AQIS—not the amendments to the Bill in relation to meat inspectors so much, but AQIS's role in terms of ensuring that we do not allow any exotic diseases into this country and the question then of the efficiencies in AQIS.

         The second area raised relates to anti-dumping and the third broad area to receive mention was the amendments associated with the water authorities and the implications of them to algal blooms. I will just take the opportunity to try to make these points very clear. I think we need to differentiate properly the role of AQIS and anti-dumping measures. AQIS was established to ensure that the standards by which a product is imported into this country meets standards we consider appropriate and at the same time establishes a rigour so that this country, which has been free and continues to remain free from disease, does not unwittingly expose itself to some form of outbreak of disease for whatever reason. I think that the success of the quarantine side of the AQIS operations is not questioned in this place in ensuring that we do not have outbreaks that effectively could wipe out much of our rural industries if they were to take off.

         I think it is very important that we do not try to see or promote AQIS as a defacto anti-dumper. I note that members on the other side of the chamber are nodding approval, but it is still of concern that in their contributions the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and my colleague the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker) both expressed concern about implications for the pork and the poultry industries. While AQIS is not under my direct authority in the portfolio—it resides with the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths)—by a previous carve-up of responsibility that I inherited I am fully aware of the concerns raised by both poultry growers and pig producers. I have had meetings with representatives from both those industries and I have undertaken to ensure that I will look carefully at the recommendations that come from AQIS.

         However, the reality is that, if imports meet the standards and if scientific evidence is available that establishes the means by which we can say that it is safe to import them, we cannot turn around and say, having established the rigour, that they should not be imported. I accept the point made by the honourable member for Maranoa concerning the view of the Veterinary Association in relation to the pork industry. I have undertaken to find out from AQIS why it still holds to its position despite knowing what the Veterinary Association asserts. I am still to receive that report, but it goes to underline my point: the pig producers cannot have it both ways. They cannot on the one hand say they want the integrity, the authority and the rigour established by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and then, on the other hand, not like the outcome and try to argue that despite the outcome we should impose some sort of requirement over AQIS not to import.

         If in fact the argument is about dumping, the appropriate mechanism to prevent that is not through the quarantine service, but through the anti-dumping authorities and the Customs Service. By way of interjection I asked the honourable member for Maranoa whether the pork industry had in fact lodged a claim with the Anti-Dumping Authority and he responded, by way of interjection to me, that it had; in fact the pork industry has not. I make that point because I often hear the Opposition trumpet along about the Government's anti-dumping provisions being deficient because it takes too long. However, if the industry has not even commenced a case, one cannot complain about the time associated with the procedures.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          I think a lot of misinformation is spread around the bush, with respect, concerning the Government's anti-dumping provisions because with two amendments made by this Government to hasten the pace of proceedings—the time scales in anti-dumping provisions—the reality is that we are now the fastest of all the countries that have anti-dumping measures. A Senate select committee on which Senator Boswell participated—and he goes around the country saying we should do it immediately—came to the conclusion that getting to that preliminary stage could not effectively be done in less time than the 55-day time scale.

         My point is twofold: first, one cannot complain about the time dimension if a case has not even been commenced because that goes to the question of establishing the case, not commencing it, and that is fundamental to any anti-dumping provisions; secondly, one cannot just magically say, `Let's shorten the period' and expect to have better anti-dumping provisions because they require, by the laws of natural justice and by our commitments in terms of GATT, the case to be proven. That information in relation to that case has to be gathered.

         I met with the pork producers as far back as December and they told me then that they were going to put a case in; they have not yet done so. I reiterate here what I have said often in the bush: so far as anti-dumping provisions are concerned, I take the stance that I would take the toughest line possible against dumpers because I think we should ensure that the people who are using corrupted production and exporting practices should not be encouraged. I stand firmly by that view but one has to make the distinction between product which enters and is cheap and product which enters and is dumped. Simply because a product costs less is not a basis in itself for keeping it out, whether it be through anti-dumping procedures or any other procedures.

         As a nation of exporters, as the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) acknowledged, we simply cannot afford to stop imports because they threaten. If they threaten because they are not fairly priced and do not reflect the cost of their production, I say we should take a tough stance on that. I have consistently argued that both in the Cabinet and in forums of my own Party, quite apart from the commitment I have made to the rural constituency. To correct the honourable member for Maranoa, who said that the United States has established a countervailing duty on pig meat, I should add that it has not.

That is an issue we need to pursue. The fact is that the citrus industry and the processors I met—and I also met with the citrus growers while I was in Berri—indicated that going on current trends of demand, because of the significant success of fresh orange juice promotion, they are going to face serious threats unless imports are allowed in, when it comes to being able to make the other, non-fresh citrus drinks.

         Those two measures do hold significant promise in terms of reduced inspection charges. I am concerned about ensuring that those benefits are passed on to growers. What particularly concerns me in this country is that this Government has embarked upon significant programs of micro-economic reform that have driven efficiencies—this is just one example—only to find that those benefits are not passed on to the people who should be entitled to reap the benefits. Therefore, I have argued consistently in this Government for the need for effective competition policy to ensure that the benefits of micro-economic reform, amongst other things, are passed on.

         In relation to the waterfront, for example, the Prices Surveillance Authority has a monitoring role to ensure that the benefits are passed on. I would be concerned in relation to meat inspection that efficiencies are being achieved and cost savings are being passed on from AQIS, but they are not necessarily translated to growers. It is of particular concern to me if all AQIS is going to do is build the profit in the process. It is for that reason I have argued—we had this discussion at the most recent meeting of the Agricultural Council—that AQIS has to do more to promote what the real savings and benefits have been. We then have to look seriously at where those charges are being passed on. I have undertaken to do that. That point should be noted here.

         The final point relates to the algal bloom. I acknowledge the comments that have been made that agriculture is not the sole cause of the problems associated with the algal bloom. I happen to believe that we really need to improve the waterways not just because it has a social dimension to it, but if this country really is to promote itself as the clean, quality food producer for the world—I think that there is particular significant potential for that—the last thing we can afford to have is green sludge floating down one of our major waterways because I know what our competitors would be showing on television screens around the world as the effective counter to any promotion campaign. Therefore I take a very strong view about the need to improve water quality not only because of the domestic perspective but also because it has international ramifications, particularly on the trade side.

I join with the honourable member for Wakefield in saying that the States need to do more.

Amongst the matters Mr Radisich asked me to represent to the Minister was a complaint about the behaviour of a public servant, Mrs Lana Spearing. I subsequently learned from the Minister's office that my letter had been passed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) for action. I have received no further communication from either Minister.

        On the afternoon of Tuesday of last week, 18 February, in my electorate office in Melbourne I received a letter by facsimile from a firm of solicitors, Dwyer and Co. of Melbourne, who stated that they were acting on behalf of Mrs Spearing. Their letter stated that Mrs Spearing had been cleared of any impropriety by an internal departmental investigation in the matter concerning Mr Radisich. In their letter the solicitors stated that they required a written apology from me, together with clarification to be sent by me to both the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training within seven days, failing which they were instructed to commence proceedings for libel. The letter was dated 13 February, albeit that I did not receive it by facsimile until 18 February, and therefore the implication was that I had 48 hours in which to respond.

         —The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991 is an omnibus Bill covering a wide range of taxation matters, mostly technical, but including some substantial policy issues. Amendments are proposed to be made to depreciation allowances, anti-avoidance provisions relating to deduction recoupment, balancing adjustment and partnership roll-over relief under capital gains tax, dividend rebates and deferral of deductions for pre-payments of trading stock. It is also proposed to amend the tax file number system, the taxation of foreign source income and substantiation discretion in relation to fringe benefits tax. I move the amendment circulated in my name, as follows:

        The proposed depreciation amendments are designed to give effect to announcements made in the March 1991 industry policy statement. It is indicative of the policy paralysis of this Government that we are debating these changes to tax law, not only nearly a year after they were first announced, but the very day before the Government makes another allegedly major economic statement which will be forced to address this very question because of the inadequacy of the Government's measures announced in the original industry policy statement last year. Of course, that policy statement was only one of many non-event statements made by the Hawke-Keating Government, and it remains to be seen whether the Keating Government can improve on that record.

         It will be very interesting to see whether the likely changes to depreciation arrangements in tomorrow's statement actually complement those contained in this legislation or whether they will supersede them to an important degree. It would not be surprising, given the Government's past record in these matters, to find that the depreciation measures we are considering today will have effect only from 12 March 1991 until 26 February 1992, only to be replaced by a whole new set of arrangements tomorrow which will add confusion and uncertainty to the tax laws affecting depreciation arrangements.

         Unfortunately, many areas of the Bill pose problems for taxpayers and tax practitioners. The Bill as a whole threatens to introduce more confusion and uncertainty into parts of taxation law. I hope to highlight these difficulties in the committee stage of the Bill and obtain some sort of response from the Minister at the table, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), so that these issues might be addressed before we forward the Bill to the Senate, where such matters are increasingly dealt with to the detriment of this chamber.

         Clearly, this Bill has not been adequately drafted and it reflects the way in which the Government introduces Bills in a mad rush at the end of a sitting year for the convenience of its legislative program rather than with a view to sound law making. It is reasonable to suppose that the Government's legislative program for 1992 will be largely determined by tomorrow's statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). We have been informed via leaks to the press that this is to be followed or accompanied by the release of a Treasury Department assessment of the impact of the coalition's Fightback proposals on Australian households. Needless to say, this assessment will be built on the assumptions deemed necessary to give the desired result, which of course will be one unfavourable to the coalition's policy proposals.

         Such a modelling exercise is an affront to the taxpayers who will foot the bill for this partisan political propaganda. It is also a gross affront to the professionalism and integrity of the Treasury officers forced to churn out this stuff. There is no doubt that this affront to the integrity of the Treasury officers has led to some of the leaking from Treasury as to the nature of the project. The Public Service is clearly embarrassed by the role it has been forced to perform under this Government.

         In any event, we have every reason to take any such assessment with a grain of salt, because even when the Treasury is making Budget forecasts it is inclined to get things dreadfully wrong, with perhaps the overbearing influence of the Government attempting to fiddle the figures. If the Treasury, under the direction of the now Prime Minister, could not be relied upon to produce even ballpark figures on the state of the macro economy, it would seem unlikely that it could generate meaningful conclusions about the micro economy, particularly on the basis of the dubious and intrusive household expenditure survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

         I remind honourable members of the following 1990-91 Budget forecasts and subsequent 1990-91 Budget outcomes under this Government and the considerable discrepancy between the two. For example, projected gross domestic product growth of 2 per cent for 1990-91 turned into a contraction over the 1990-91 year of minus 0.9 per cent. One could not be much farther out than that. The forecast unemployment rate of 7.25 per cent actually reached 8.4 per cent. The forecast Budget surplus of $8.1 billion for 1990-91 deteriorated into a surplus of a mere $1.896 billion—$6 billion and more out. So we can be excused for treating with indifference the analysis of our Fightback package, made in the name of the Treasury, when that analysis surfaces later this week, next week or sometime in the future.

         According to some private sector studies the Budget deficit for this financial year, 1991-92, could blow out to as much as $9 billion, even before making any allowance for the new spending initiatives that will be announced in tomorrow's statement. A major contributor to this outcome will be an expected fall of 8.1 per cent in real terms—that is, $5.4 billion—in tax collections due to the recession-induced collapse in the Federal Government's revenue base. Tomorrow's statement will regrettably be a pump-priming exercise with a great deal of window dressing substituting for substance and with doubtful value and benefit in the longer term.

         However, any such stimulus will come too late to make much difference to the breadth and depth of the current recession which is now the most protracted as well as the deepest recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The additional fiscal stimulus will ensure that we have increasing interest and inflation rates if and when we ever come out of the recession, thereby putting in jeopardy the prospective recovery and the sustenance of any recovery. In fact, the Government will be paving the way for another recession, all for the sake of being seen to do too little too late. We run the great risk of finding ourselves in that rolling recession that we have experienced over the last almost two years continuing well into the future. Some economists describe it as a dead cat bounce.

         The politicisation of Treasury in these matters extends to the Australian Taxation Office, which is, of course, responsible for the administration of the Bill we have before us today. Last week we were treated to the results of the Australian Taxation Office audit of the top 100 companies in Australia and the news that the program may be extended to include a further 500 companies, thereby extending this audit operation to the top 600 Australian companies. The Tax Office now claims that it has raked in an additional $1.3 billion in additional tax and penalty payments as a result of this particular audit program since it began in 1988. It is very interesting to note that out of this $1.3 billion in claimed extra tax collections, only one case of tax evasion was uncovered, tax evasion being illegal, as all honourable members would understand. Clearly, most companies are complying with the terms of the tax law, and this has been recognised in the Tax Office report announcing the results of the program so far.

         More than half of the revenue collected from the large case audit program has come from companies which have taken positions in grey areas of the tax law which are entirely legitimate, but subject to dispute at a later date. Indeed, it is reported only today that BHP is to take to court a dispute with the Tax Office over some $185m as a result of one of these audits. This is the bulk of the $193m that the Tax Office contends is owed by BHP in back taxes and, who knows, it is probably included in that figure of overall collections to which I referred earlier. A total of over $550m is currently under dispute in this way, with the Tax Office expected to collect about half of that amount. It is also noteworthy that only one per cent of the liabilities emerging from the large case tax audit program from grey areas of the law had a relevant ruling to guide the taxpayer at the time that the relevant transaction took place.

         The results of the large case audit program have been hailed as something of a great success, principally by the Tax Office itself in self-justification, but by few if any other commentators, even the Government. The results of the program are in reality merely symptomatic of a massive failure in the making and administration of tax laws in this country. The size of these belated revenue collections is indicative of an extremely complicated tax law with high compliance and collection costs, and makes adherence to the law a luxury even for the largest corporations, let alone individuals and those owning and operating small businesses. Many companies are clearly unable to comply with the tax law without the assistance of an audit team from the Australian Taxation Office over a period of weeks and sometimes months.

         But whatever the merits of the large case audit program, it is outrageous that so much effort is being poured into such audit activity, which may now be extended, when the tax law simplification program is being starved of adequate resources. This Parliament and the Australian people have been promised a major tax law simplification exercise since the then Treasurer Keating's statement in February 1990. Yet almost nothing of note has emerged from the Tax Office on this front. The large case audit program is purely revenue driven and has little value in clarifying the law for other taxpayers and does little to help the targets of the audit. What value it does have lies in allowing the Tax Office, and by extension the Government, to be seen to be cracking down on the tax affairs of Australia's larger companies. There is a widespread perception that these companies do not pull their weight in tax matters, and the Government seeks to capitalise on this perception through the audit activities of the Australian Taxation Office and, I might add, the well-publicised activities of the Tax Office. However, the Australian Taxation Office's own audit program has revealed this perception to be unfounded and it is not helped by the misleading way in which the preliminary outcome of the large case audit program has been reported in the media.

         It is about time the Government got its priorities right and got on with the job of simplifying the tax law instead of devoting the better part of its resources to harassing corporate taxpayers into impossible compliance responsibilities. We will not see the end of large revenue takes from the large case audits until we sort out the current mess in tax laws. I hope we can make some progress in this regard in the committee stage of this Bill.

         In the light of all this, it is not surprising to find that the head of group taxation at the National Australia Bank, Mr Martin Crowe, in a speech to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia, recently called for a major review of Australian Taxation Office powers. Under our self-assessment system, taxpayers are required to self-assess complicated aspects of our confusing tax laws but are then faced with a penalty system which is still built largely around the old system whereby the Tax Office was responsible for calculating tax liability.

         There is a pressing need not just for the simplification of tax law but also for a complete overhaul of the penalties regime, to better reflect the advent of self-assessment in the tax system. Not only is our tax system an administrative nightmare; it introduces some major disincentives to investment and damages the international competitiveness of our exports. These disincentives have been highlighted recently in a number of reviews of business taxation by the Industry Commission and, of course, by business groups.

Of course, the coalition also plans to remove a whole raft of business taxes, including the wholesale sales tax, fuel excise and payroll tax. The removal of these taxes will be not just a major boost to business and consumers; some of the great complexity in the tax system, particularly in the case of wholesale sales tax, and the compliance costs associated with this complexity, will be removed.

         The country can simply no longer afford to make the mistakes with its tax system that are now enshrined in taxation law. The cost in terms of economic growth, jobs and export performance is simply too high. Many of the nearly one million unemployed people in this country owe their plight to the current state of the taxation system and the disincentives built into it for the wealth creating business sector. Those include the 100,000 unemployed people in my own State of Western Australia, which my colleague the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) knows about only too well.

Some of them are noteworthy, however, for being in accord with the coalition's policies and they provide a useful reference point against the actual contents of tomorrow's statement.

         The Institute's No. 1 submission calls on the Federal Government to provide funds to the States by way of State grants to provide relief from payroll tax. Of course, this is perfectly consistent with our proposal to abolish payroll tax and is absolutely essential to any pro-jobs growth strategy. The Institute suggests introducing partial relief from wholesale sales tax and the delayed introduction of a modest goods and services tax. Of course, these suggestions are half-measures, but they do at least point the Government in the right direction, which is the direction taken by the Fightback package.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has decided to turn this into a wide-ranging debate on taxation law, so I hope you will allow me to make some general comments of the kind he made. Let me begin by stating that we are not about to impose on the Australian people a 15 per cent tax on all goods and services. The reality is that, if we were to do anything like that, we would justifiably be thrown out of government. Indeed, if by some miracle the Opposition ever did get into government and was able to implement such a measure—assuming that it could pass through the Senate—the whole of the Australian nation would rebel against it.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, can you imagine what it means to the average person to have a 15 per cent tax imposed on every good and service: on food, on clothing, on the basic necessities of life?  That is what the Opposition is talking about. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said today, the reason the Opposition wants to impose this tax is that it does not have any solutions in the economic arena. It has not had any solutions for the past 10 years. It does not even know how the economy operates. Therefore, those opposite come up with this nonsense that somehow a goods and services tax will miraculously transform the economy, create jobs. In what way would a goods and services tax create jobs? I would give a PhD to anybody who could explain how that in itself, without investment, creates jobs.

         —He has got a PhD, but it does not apply in this particular area, I can tell the honourable member. The reality is that the goods and services tax is a con trick on the Australian people, an attempt to persuade them that this is something new that will do something for the economy. It avoids the big questions about how employment will be created. As the Prime Minister mentioned today at Question Time, it appears that the Opposition feels that it can create lots of jobs without spending a penny; that it can get all of this reform—new infrastructure projects, the building of roads and rail—without spending a penny. That is what the Opposition seems to think is the reality.

         When the Government discussed with the private sector the possibility that we may have to spend some money in infrastructure development, the private sector, including business leaders, said to the Government, `You had better spend some money on infrastructure'.

It might not have occurred to him that it will cost money. If it costs money, it means that the deficit will be increased. If there is to be an increase in the deficit, does that then mean that we will have to face the problem that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has come up with?

         I can assure honourable members that in the next few months we are looking at a horror time for the Leader of the Opposition. It started here today. Last year he had a fun time. He was able to float his proposals and he thought there was no intellectual challenge to them. But we see that there is even an intellectual challenge to them from the very people who drafted the proposals. They at least have the honesty to say, `This proposal will result in negative growth'. Can anyone imagine putting forward a proposal which not only does not create new production and new jobs, but also actually promotes negative growth so that we have a situation which is worse than having a recession?  The Opposition will bring this on by putting in this 15 per cent tax. What an extraordinary phenomenon.

         As the Prime Minister pointed out today, Murphy himself has said that inflation is a big danger—it may go out to 10 per cent. So we will have very little growth, inflation and—worst of all—increased unemployment. I remind people that when Margaret Thatcher was elected she promised to reduce unemployment through this formula. But what did she do? Unemployment tripled, not doubled, in Britain under—

         —The honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) has revealed to us tonight the full extent of his economic illiteracy. We are talking, I take it, about the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4), though one could sit here for 20 minutes and not get any inkling of that from listening to what the honourable member for Calwell had to say. I must observe that the Government has its big economic guns trained on us tonight with the honourable member for Calwell talking about economic genius and economic gurus. I do not know what he has his PhD in, but I am sure it is not economics. He says he does not understand or know much about what a value added tax is or what its economic benefits are. I suggest to him that he can do no better than to ask the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), because back in 1985 he was one of the great advocates of a broad-based consumption tax for this country. After the honourable member for Calwell leaves the chamber he might go around to the Prime Minister's office and get a quick lesson on how the GST works.

         As the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) said, leading the debate for the Opposition earlier tonight, the Opposition is in general agreement with the broad thrust of the legislation which is before us tonight and which amends the taxation laws in a number of respects. Some of the proposed measures are certainly complex and I doubt, with the greatest respect to the former Minister Assisting the Treasurer, whether in making the second reading speech he understood entirely what he was talking about. The 193-page explanatory memorandum which accompanies the Minister's second reading speech is in itself something like an accounting textbook. I suspect that even accountants would have great difficulty understanding this document. The legislation itself extends to 86 pages.

         The Opposition, as is reflected in our amendment, is somewhat bemused by the timing of the introduction of this legislation. We hope that tomorrow night the Prime Minister will seriously address the issue of taxation reform. I am very happy to support the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Curtin, which condemns and strongly criticises the Government for its failure so far to adopt a comprehensive approach to much needed taxation reform. I think that should be on the top of the Prime Minister's agenda tomorrow night. I look forward to seeing whether, after nine years, he has finally come to grips with the need for comprehensive taxation reform in this country.

        However, the most pervasive, and the Committee believes most important, complaint has been about the rapid growth in size and complexity of taxation law.

        Two years down the track since the comprehensive report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology was tabled in parliament, there has been no serious attempt to address these issues. The report and, with respect, the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) have been a great disappointment to the small business community in this country. I suspect that, with the very real prospect of the coalition winning the seat of Rankin at the next election, the Minister will not be back here in any case.

         As I have said, and as the shadow Minister for small business, housing and customs, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), has said, the Committee made some very clear and sensible recommendations in respect of taxation reform and capital gains tax. Recommendation 34 says:

        That is very sensible. Nothing has happened. The Committee said of wholesale sales tax:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Wholesale sales tax has been one of the areas of Commonwealth taxation subject to extensive criticism in evidence in the inquiry.

        The Committee recommended as follows:

       </para>
       <para>
        What happened to that recommendation? Nothing. The Government has sat on its collective hands for two years and it has fallen to the Opposition to come up with an alternative taxation system for Australia, a system which addresses the problem of the wholesale sales tax by simply abolishing it, wiping it out and recognising it for what it is—inequitable, unfair, complicated and everything else that has been said about it, not only by the Beddall report but by others—and  at the same time abolishes six other taxes which are equally counterproductive.

         The Opposition has addressed the concerns of small business in respect of capital gains tax as well. The Government has had two years to do something about it. Perhaps we will see the Prime Minister finally addressing this issue tomorrow night. I challenge him to do so. The most counterproductive aspects of the capital gains tax as it affects small business include: firstly, 80 per cent of the goodwill value of a business up to a ceiling of $1m is liable to capital gains tax, which is a significant deterrent to anyone who works hard to build up a business; secondly, the application of capital gains tax to the nest egg assets of Australians who sell their business on retirement, as many people do, which is legitimate. They work for many years to build up a small business asset, which they liquidate as their retirement package. We address that issue as well. Thirdly, the application of capital gains tax to assets sold in the process of expanding a business, a major disincentive to growth and employment; and, fourthly, the application of capital gains tax, and its administrative burden, especially to very small investors. Very small investors and many individuals are quite innocently caught up in the capital gains tax net.

         The coalition has recognised, and for some reason the Government has not, that these things can be addressed fairly simply. Each of those matters that I just mentioned have been addressed in the Fightback package. We have made a commitment to addressing the wrongs which are imposed on small business by virtue of Labor's capital gains tax. We recognise, and this is something of a change from our position of some years back, that there is a legitimate place in the income tax system for a tax on capital gain derived as income. However, in government we will remove the worst aspects of Labor's capital gains tax, which is penalising Australians who are prepared to work hard on their own account.

         The coalition has decided to adopt certain changes to Labor's capital gains tax arrangements. Firstly, the tax payable on a capital gain will continue to be calculated according to the existing formula using the marginal rates of tax applying under our taxation policy. These rates will be significantly lower than they currently are under Labor.

         Secondly, an exemption will be introduced on small net capital gains made by individuals. An adult individual taxpayer who in any year has made net gains which they assess to be under $3,000 may simply specify the year of acquisition of the assets concerned, their nominal purchase price and their nominal sales price. Subject to normal audit provisions, these taxpayers will then pay no tax on relevant capital gains.

         Thirdly, under our proposal for capital gains tax relief for small business, there will be a 50 per cent relief on the part of a capital gain attributable to the sale of goodwill where the sale price for the goodwill is $500,000 or less. However, the worst feature of the present tax system is the way in which it has systematically ripped off Australian workers. This Government, in the time it has been in office, has increased its revenue by billions of dollars through stealth; that is, by hanging onto revenue generated from bracket creep.

         —The message from this table is clear:  due to the impact of inflation since 1982-83, tax brackets ought to have been approximately doubled to avoid the arbitrary impact of bracket creep. When they were not increased, taxpayers were shunted into higher brackets and therefore into higher marginal rates. Although that might sound a little bit technical, everyone out there knows what I am talking about. One is simply being penalised through bracket creep for earning more money.

         In the time remaining, I want to turn briefly to that part of the Bill before us which deals with depreciation amendments. There is no doubt in my mind, and I am sure the Opposition shares this view, that Australia's taxation system must give adequate incentives to business investment. I am sure that the effective life basis for assessing depreciation which is addressed in the legislation will be welcomed. The Opposition will, however, maintain its commitment to a further review of depreciation arrangements when we come to government. That commitment is spelt out in the Fightback package and I believe it is a significant indication of our intentions in respect of depreciation policy.

Although particularly on the Gold Coast we have had fantastic development over the last 10 years, largely financed externally, it is a matter for regret that Australian financial institutions, individuals and corporations have failed to recognise the potential that the tourism industry has within Australia. I hope that will be changed. One way that it may be changed—it may have to be changed—is through greater recognition of the possibility of providing incentives for Australians to invest in tourism.

The consortium's request to the Government for 10-year depreciation and changes to law to enable the issue of long term zero convertibles were made in the expectation that the Government would find these measures reasonable.

This will have a number of effects. It will meet obligations incurred by the Government in signalling the availability of the concession to industry and the change in the deduction threshold. This is considered important as plant constitutes the heavier end of R&amp;D expenditures.

         The scheme, which was commenced in 1985, was to finish in June 1991 but was extended in the May 1991 science and technology statement to June 1993, with a further phasing down to 125 per cent to 1995. The scheme was then to be terminated. However, the 12 March 1991 industry statement extended its life indefinitely at 125 per cent.

         There can be no argument that industry investment was guided by the belief that the scheme would be operating at the 150 per cent level. If anything, government vacillation on the scheme has distorted investment. I would contend that the proposed measures before the House discriminate between large and smaller companies in respect of their degree of capitalisation in a recession. Better placed companies can bring on investment and avail themselves of higher deduction rates while those trying to clear the recession and invest later will attract only the lower level of deduction. This is an initiative which will benefit a small number of big companies. The whole scheme, for all intents and purposes, is designed to benefit larger companies with taxation liabilities.

         It is more likely that the Government in truth has allowed this extension as part of a political strategy to bring forward as much investment as possible before June 1993. Plant is an investment which can be brought forward with ease because, unlike other R&amp;D activities, it does not require a developmental or incubation period. Undoubtedly the Government strategy in this regard will form part of its wider ploy to offset the real nature of the fall in private investment and artificially inflate the numbers.

         Let me turn to the second major effect that the proposed changes will have. This relates to deductions for core technology which will be limited by the Australian Taxation Office to arm's length amount. This phrase, `arm's length amount', according to other references in the Bill, means `not artificially inflated'. So the object of the Bill is to extend the existing provisions containing claims for deductions by drawing in core technology deductions as well.

         `Core technology' refers to intellectual property, the idea from which a development project proceeds. Under the existing criteria, the scheme allows companies to deduct expenditures incurred in acquiring or developing such property or core technology at 100 per cent since May 1990. Obviously there has been a problem and companies are utilising the definition of core technology to inflate valuations thereof. No further information is provided in the Bill about this matter.

         There is a history of problems arising from the way in which companies manipulate core technology for taxable purposes. In May 1990 the Government moved to halt companies utilising these provisions for purposes other than those intended, but it seems that further changes are needed. This amendment to the principal Act suggests that the administration of the Act has met with continuing difficulties and that some companies have been subverting its intended objectives.

         I turn to the third major effect of the proposed changes in the Bill before the House. This relates to the core technology expenditures being deducted from the formula determining the amount of deduction to be allowed in cases where there are guaranteed returns for investors. The Government introduced provisions for syndicated research proposals to attract tax deductions at the rate of 150 per cent in November 1987. This action was taken to ensure that projects too big or too risky for a single company could be pursued by one or more investors. These syndicated research groups became a vehicle for contrived schemes offering guaranteed returns to investors. The concerns were reported on in the 1988-89 financial year, and in September 1989 the Government tried to plug the holes. You may recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the legislation was debated in May 1990.

         As it is, the Act now reduces the level of the deduction available in accord with the degree of risk or exposure taken on by a company. The amendment in the Bill before the House subtracts the value of core technology from the formula used to calculate the amount by which a deduction will be reduced when part of the R&amp;D investment is deemed not to be at risk. The intention of the exercise is to ensure that where an investment is not at risk it attracts only a 100 per cent deduction, as is usually the case.

         Given this, it would seem that the Government is still having problems managing the scheme in regard to companies using it to derive undeserved advantages. Given the high risk of R&amp;D, the 100 per cent plus concession is deemed necessary, but a company which incurs limited risks does not deserve the concession. They are the three major effects of the changes under the Bill being considered.

         I would make some further points. The concession is more than just an extension of the 100 per cent standard business tax deduction. This is why the argument that it is only 25 per cent more than the 100 per cent deduction is wrong. Many in the science community are dissatisfied that the tax concession is 125 per cent as from June 1993 and not 150 per cent. They argue, in my view erroneously, that it is only 25 per cent more than what would be a normal business deduction.

         But it is not just a question of giving businesses another 25 per cent of 39c in the dollar. This is not much. What is important about this scheme is that it allows other activities to be drawn under the deduction umbrella that are not allowable deductions under the standard 100 per cent business deduction. That is, it allows tax deferral advantages such as accelerated depreciation of R&amp;D plant and equipment over three years at the premium level, which is still 150 per cent under this Bill; 100 per cent deductibility for core technology for R&amp;D purposes; and advance payments and accelerated provisions for certain contracted R&amp;D. It is more than likely that these could not have been claimed under the taxation Act prior to the introduction of the concession.

The figures do not account for recoupment from the effects of dividend imputation, so the actual amount forgone could be much less.

         In summary in regard to this aspect of the legislation, the Opposition does not oppose the extension of the 150 per cent beyond June 1993 for those who are already investing in plant. Nonetheless, the Opposition makes the point that the Government continues to experience severe difficulties in proper administration of this scheme and on any reckoning it is an expensive scheme for the Government. I should stress that under the Opposition's Fightback package, so well known to members of this House and to a growing admiring public outside this chamber, we will continue with the 125 per cent tax concession for R&amp;D.

         However, the whole problem of the Government's approach to science and technology is exemplified by the Bill before the House. It does not face up to the major impediment to the commercialisation of R&amp;D. We will keep that for another day. Moreover the Government does not appreciate that artificial schemes at taxpayers' expense are no answers in comparison to the removal of the high costs which deter manufacturing in Australia from taking advantage of so much of the very good research undertaken in this country. The problem is not the quality of the research done in this country; it is simply that the manufacturing sector does not operate in the right investment settings to take advantage of it. An example of this is, of course, the Government's national procurement and development program, which the Industry Commission has recently reported on.

          The NPDP is a scheme by which the Government will fund the bringing together of high tech development with the Public Service so that the Public Service is made more aware of the computer opportunities, for example, that a small Australian company is offering.

         While those sorts of schemes almost always seem impressive at first blush, on further examination we find that schemes like the NPDP are faintly flawed. The Industry Commission found that the NPDP had been unable to meet its basic program objectives of meeting the procurement needs of government or industry. The program had a heavy cost, amounting to some $25m. This public money had been virtually a direct transfer of funds to a selective band of industries. There was a finding that only 10 out of 24 grant recipients had reported sales from the projects given support. These sales amounted to $12m, while some claim that they amounted to $50m, so there is an accounting dispute there. The Industry Commission said that projects yet to come on stream did not hold great promise in turning around the IC's findings. Accordingly the IC argued that the NPDP would hardly even pay its own way.

Moreover, the all up cost of administering the program absorbed 20 per cent of the total cost of the program. This led the

        As a major purchaser of goods and services, Australia's departments of the Public Service have it in their power to exert considerable influence over the development of local markets. As such there is good reason to give a close eye to the potential role for such purchasing power in regard to industry strategy, but such a broad policy objective gives rise to an important question concerning the extent to which governments should co-opt the commercial activities of the public sector and direct it to serve an extraneous objective.

         Whenever governments intervene in this way, it means that the community ultimately pays an additional price for meeting that objective.

         In the case of the Public Service, it means a greater call on Government outlays and contributes to higher levels of taxation than would otherwise be the case. In the case of the private sector it means higher prices for the consumer and a loss of international competitiveness. It should never be assumed, therefore, that these activities revolving around procurement policies are cost neutral. If the purpose of  government's policies is to bring greater efficiencies into the conduct of the economy, it is not hard to see how manipulating what should be straight out commercial decisions on the basis of price and performance would be counter-productive to that end.

         There is a commonly held assumption that small, under-capitalised companies would instantly become efficient and internationally competitive if they were provided with preferential treatment in respect of government procurement policies. Unfortunately the development of greater efficiencies and a higher level of competitiveness in small Australian companies are dependent on a number of other crucial issues that are not affected by size. The IC report found that the NPDP never helped small scale industries or companies or firms, despite the myth; it helped established medium sized companies. The areas the Government should be tackling relate to input costs, level of government costs and charges and taxation. The Fightback package addresses those fundamental and crucial elements to a business's viability, not least of all in the area of high technology manufacturing.

         —I rise to discuss one aspect of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4), the aspect of the depreciation arrangements that are mooted in the Bill. As we know, the concept of the Bill was first brought forward during the 12 March 1991 statement by the previous Prime Minister. He announced essentially the arrangements that now appear in the Bill. They are not considered to be appropriate by business, or at least they are not considered to be any great improvement on the arrangements that were in place before.

         I suppose that if one has to make a judgment about the intention of this Bill, which is to simplify and perhaps to make life a little easier for these people wishing to depreciate plant, one has to remember that the former Minister Assisting the Treasurer has stated that the cost to the Government will be $100m, a measly sum, and one can see that after all the work that has gone into the Bill, it has probably saved manufacturers very little.

         As I said, these arrangements were mooted on 12 March 1991 when the first of the four great economic statements in the last 12 months or so—the culmination of which will be tomorrow night, I am sure—came forward. Earlier I heard the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) talk about the cynicism of the public which is racing through the community. That is understandable when one realises that the arrangements in this Bill were announced on 12 March 1991; it was reviewed and explained by the then Treasurer and Senator Button in September; it was introduced on the eve of Christmas; it is being debated tonight; and it will be changed tomorrow night. That is a very unsatisfactory set of arrangements. I referred to the fact that it was explained by those two honourable gentlemen. Included in a rather long six- or seven-page dissertation were some examples.

         I presume those honourable gentlemen thought it was appropriate to give some examples because nothing had been done, the Bill had not come forward and it was being discussed by government and business in great detail. But we can understand the confusion of the public and business when one of the examples set out that a wheat farmer might be expected to do 100,000 hours of work with a tractor in five years, at which point it explained quite simply that it would no longer be useful for income production. It sure would not be, because that works out to be 20,000 hours a year.

         I know that some of the gentlemen devising this Bill come from Queensland and other places where daylight saving is much debated, but it has been a long time since there have been 20,000 hours in a year. Those examples were perpetuated all the way down the page and right through, so it was little wonder that it took until the eve of Christmas or thereabouts to produce the Bill. But, as we all know, these arrangements are retrospective; they have been in place since 1 July 1991 and in some cases prior to that where arrangements were made after 12 March 1991. So to that extent I suppose we have to legitimise them. Why on earth they are being brought forward tonight when tomorrow night—as we understand it from the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who talked about everything but this Bill but did mention the words `accelerated depreciation' and said that he was very keen on it, as are many other honourable members, we have come to understand, on the Government side—there will be some changes along those lines I do not know. Will those changes be accelerated depreciation? Will they be a furthering of the loading? Will we go from 20 per cent to 40 per cent or from 20 per cent to 60 per cent? What will the arrangements be for the changes to the depreciation arrangements in this country? We do not know what they will be.

This was after an explanation of the arrangements that were mooted in this Bill. But tomorrow night we understand there will be some other arrangements. So already those arrangements outlined in a very definitive statement by the current Prime Minister when putting the arrangements in the Bill forward on 12 March look as though they are going to be changed yet again.

No doubt tomorrow night we will see that assets can be written off at a faster pace, and we will look forward to seeing what those arrangements are.

Firstly, with regard to the delay, it is true that a significant time has elapsed between the announcement of these measures and the actual debating of the legislation in the House. However, I would point out that that delay has permitted a fairly extensive process of consultation with business and with tax professionals to try to iron out potential glitches in the legislation.

         The second reading amendment moved by the Opposition bemoans, firstly, the delay which I have already commented on briefly, but it also then goes on to bemoan the Government's failure to tackle the problem of tax reform in a comprehensive way. I would simply say that in the record of this Government there is a massive program of tax reform which has been introduced and implemented. In 1985, of course, we had a very wide range of measures arising out of the tax summit. There was the introduction of capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax, dividend imputation and substantiation, and the list goes on and on. It is not my intention to bore the House by giving a full rendition of everything that has been done by way of tax reform. I would simply observe that those opposite really cannot argue that there has not been a major program of tax reform. Opposition members would, no doubt, disagree with the content of that program of tax reform, nonetheless they cannot deny the substance of what has been done.

Going by the international experience, if we look at the consequence of the introduction of a set of measures of the kind favoured by the Opposition, there is absolutely no reason to suppose that that set of measures will lead to an improvement in our economic circumstances. To the contrary, if we look across the Tasman Sea at New Zealand where there is something similar in the sense of the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax substituting for income tax to some extent, what do we find? We find an effective five-year recession in that country.

         The Opposition does not seem to be opposing any of the specific provisions or the general thrust of the legislation. On the whole it seems to welcome it although it reckons that it is inadequate. The Government, as a result of consultations, particularly with business groups, is prepared to look at some technical amendments to the legislation for movement in the Senate. A couple of points in particular have come to our attention, but I might leave those to the committee stage because I know that the Opposition wants to raise some points which may or may not coincide with the ones we intend to deal with.

         —Before I get to the first group of clauses I wish to discuss I simply want to make the point that, whilst the explanatory memorandum presented is in a much improved format and enables us to follow exactly what the Government intends by bridging clauses in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4), and having indeed in some cases clauses common to more than one proposition in the Bill, there are difficulties for treatment in committee. I am sure that no-one is really in the mood to take a point of order in that I might be discussing a group of clauses other than the main clauses I wish to discuss. I am sure the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) would understand that, whilst technically he might be able to claim that I am not speaking strictly to the clauses before the Committee, I wish to assure him I am talking about the bulk of the matters being dealt with group by group. Incidentally, it is something that the House might like to consider at some stage, particularly in committee.

         The first group I want to talk about comprises, in the main, clauses 3, 4 and 5, dealing with fringe benefits tax substantiation and discretion provisions in the Bill. Clauses 3, 4 and 5 seek to amend the fringe benefits tax law to provide the Commissioner with a discretion to accept a lower level of substantiation than is currently allowable. Proposed new section 123B in the principal Act, the Fringe Benefits Tax Act 1986, is designed to soften the requirement to comply with substantiation rules by providing the Commissioner with a discretion to ignore an absence of compliance. The requirement introduced with proposed section 123B(1)(a) is that the Commissioner be:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . satisfied that. . . a benefit has been provided in, or in respect of, a year of tax in respect of the employment of an employee of an employer. . .
       </para>
       <para>
        In this connection the Taxation Institute has commented as follows:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is difficult to understand why the Commissioner needs to reach a state of satisfaction as to the provision of a benefit. If no benefit has been provided there would be no need to consider the application of the substantiation rules and therefore no need to ameliorate their impact.
       </para>
       <para>
        It also appears that the discretion will not apply to a request for amendment made after the date of royal assent. This seems to be designed to reduce the administrative workload of the Commissioner and really has no basis in policy. It almost goes without saying that, if there are grounds for exercising the discretion, review should be allowed across the board with retrospective effect to the date of commencement of the original FBT legislation. If the Commissioner has acted to disallow an objection or determine an amendment request before the date of commencement of the amendment, the taxpayer will not, as it presently stands, be afforded relief. However, if the Commission has been slow about reaching a conclusion, the taxpayer will be able to seek relief. That seems to me to be reverse justice and quite unfair.

         The legislation should not provide relief based merely on the level of activity or the lack of it by the Commissioner, but that is the effect of the proposed amendments under clauses 3, 4 and 5 and associated clauses.

         The Bill proposes in these clauses to change the requirements concerning dividend rebates where company beneficiaries and partners are involved. It sets out to extend the scope of the inter-company dividend rebate to allow the rebate to companies that are not shareholders. The amendment is designed to overcome the effect of the High Court decision in the Patcorp case whereby only the registered shareholder was entitled to the inter-company dividend rebate. Even though a company was absolutely entitled to the shares as against the trustee, and was taxed on the dividend as trust income, it was not entitled to the rebate. The entitlement of the beneficial owner or partner—that is, a company—to the rebate will be determined as if it were a shareholder and had received a dividend equal to its share of the income of the trust or partnership that relates to the dividend.

         The amendment we are discussing applies to dividends paid after the High Court handed down the decision in Patcorp. The assessment of any company that was not allowed the rebate in an assessment that issued before today will not be able to have that assessment amended to allow the rebate. There have been some instances, I understand, where corporate beneficiaries who have not technically been absolutely entitled to the share as against the trustee, such as in the case of a discretionary trust, have been allowed the dividend rebate. According to my informed information, to the extent that what I have said is so, there is an inconsistency between the Commissioner's past practice and the proposed amendments contained in this Bill, particularly given that the amendments proposed in section 45Z(1) are to be retrospective to give effect to the Commissioner's past practice.

         The Taxation Institute argues in this case that the proposed new section should apply to all instances where dividend rebates have been allowed in the past. The coalition tends to support that, for want of better knowledge, as I think I read in an Australian poem once, and for want of any case in the matter put by the Government. To do as the Institute proposes would reflect the administrative practice of the Commissioner and it would overcome potential anomalies where the Commissioner would be entitled under the provision as now drafted to disallow a dividend rebate claimed by a taxpayer in reliance upon the Commissioner's administrative practice as understood by the taxpayer.

         It would appear that private rulings have been issued which allow a dividend rebate to be claimed in cases where a corporate beneficiary under a discretionary trust has received past distributions. The effect of the proposed amendment in not extending to distributions under discretionary trusts occurring after the date of operation of the provision is consistent with a limited view of the Commissioner's administrative practice. But this fails to take into account the fact that under the imputation system introduced in 1987 the flow through of franking credits in a trust structure is permitted.

         The Tax Institute has raised with the coalition a matter of criticism about the application of proposed section 66(1) which effectively prohibits any taxpayer who has received an assessment in which the Commissioner has disallowed the dividend rebate from objecting to that assessment.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Such a disallowance has only occurred in one well publicised situation and it seems totally inequitable to fetter one particular taxpayer (or group of taxpayers) from exercising normal objection and appeal rights under the assessment act.

         As far as clause 14 is concerned, it surrounds the deferral of deductions for trading stock purchases involving prepayments. In relation to the deferral of deductions for prepayment of trading stock, the Bill in this clause affirms the principle of matching tax deductions for expenditure on trading stock against income from selling that stock in the appropriate tax year. Currently, expenditure on trading stock is initially deductible under section 51 in the year in which it is incurred. To match deductions against appropriate income, section 28 writes back as income the value of trading stock on hand at the end of the year so that deductions are deferred until the stock is sold. The Raymor case exposed a weakness in the interaction of sections 51 and 28. In that case, the taxpayer was able to achieve a tax timing advantage by prepaying the cost of certain trading stock that was not delivered or made by the end of the tax year. Because the stock was not on hand at year end, section 28 could not operate to defer the deduction allowable under section 51 for the expenditure incurred in that year.

         As I have said, the amendment is designed to ensure that a deduction under section 51 for expenditure on stock is not available until the stock becomes trading stock on hand. However, a possible defect in the proposed new provision is that, if the goods never come on hand because they are dealt with by the purchaser between the time of ordering them and the time of their delivery, when they would ordinarily constitute trading stock, no deduction will ever be allowed under section 51 as the clause is currently drafted. In other words, in my opinion, the clause as it is currently drafted will not meet the stated intention of the Government in this connection.

         The effect of the amendments is to limit recoupment to those few situations where roll-over relief has been afforded under the capital gains tax provisions. Again, the Taxation Institute of Australia cites an example of how restrictive this can be in the case of a father passing over a farm to his son for a consideration which may not be a full consideration, in which case the father will be deemed to have disposed of all the plant and equipment at its market value, to the detriment of the business to be conducted by the son.

         —The Arts, Sport, Environment and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 is one of a number of Bills before the Parliament at the moment which deal with a range of Bills and provide for relatively minor amendments to each of them. In this case there are seven Bills involved. The Opposition does not oppose any of the amendments, although we do intend at the committee stage to move an amendment with respect to one of these provisions. That provision, which I will mention briefly at this second reading stage, is the amendment to the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 which will introduce a ministerial power of direction in relation to the Draft Territory Plan where the Territory planning authority continues to object to any aspect of the draft plan prepared by the National Capital Planning Authority. This ministerial power is one which the Opposition is prepared to see put into the Act but in our view, given the self-governing nature of the Territory, there should at least be an obligation for consultation with the relevant Territory Minister. We will, therefore, seek to make that relatively minor amendment to the proposed new section of the principal Act.

         Self-government in the ACT has come in for its share of ridicule in recent years. Under both Liberal and Labor administrations I have heard very harsh things said about the structures that have been put in place. In debating this Bill, I would like to take the opportunity to record my personal satisfaction with the evident change that has occurred here where one hears now in the ACT debate among residents of the ACT about the priorities that will apply in their government—about whether schools should be opened or closed, hospitals opened or closed and so on.

         Notwithstanding the teething problems and notwithstanding that a Labor government has been re-elected, which is not a matter of great satisfaction to me, the real point of substance with respect to self-government in this Territory is that the residents of the ACT have for the first time been forced to face, deal with and take responsibility for the issues which affect them as a community. I believe that any community of Australian adults ought to do that. I express my personal satisfaction that those vexed issues of priorities have to be dealt with by the people who live in the ACT, as they have to be dealt with by the people who live in the States, in the areas of Australia that we represent around the country.

        I remember once having the pleasure of appearing for a defendant in a prosecution under the Quarantine Act. It was the first contact I had had with that Act and, somewhat to my surprise, I found that all that seemed to be necessary to prove the guilt of the defendant was to produce a certificate, say that the defendant was the defendant and had been identified as such, and to sit down, because the Act provided that all of the elements of the offence were proved just by averment of the facts.

         I may be faintly misremembering that very distant case, but I mention it to make a point that our legislative provisions, both State and Federal, are littered with provisions which enable facts to be proved at least to the point of being prima facie established, as they are under these provisions, without the need to produce what might be called hard evidence. In this case the certificate of the analyst is proof of a series of matters in the absence of some proof to the contrary.

         As a Parliament, we need to be very careful in continually limiting, in a sense, the freedom of the subject that we are not making it more difficult for people to defend themselves. The Opposition, on its examination of these provisions, does not believe that they do unduly trespass on individual rights and liberties. As an ex-senator I take some consolation from the fact that in the Senate the legislation will receive scrutiny by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, where it will be given professional assessment against a series of tests as to whether it trespasses on individual rights and liberties in a way which is undue.

         I think that is important. I make this comment in part because of the debate which I listened to in the committee stage of the previous Bill. I thought that the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), in leading for the Opposition, made a series of very pertinent points about the taxation legislation that was being dealt with, raised questions about the efficacy of the legislation and did so in an area where there is near universal complaint about the state of the law, which is in a state of confusion and complexity that virtually guarantees that no honest person can be sure that he or she is complying with the taxation laws of this country. They are at such a level of complexity that it is impossible for any honest person to be really certain that he or she is meeting all the requirements of the taxation legislation.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In fairness to the Minister who was in charge of the previous Bill, the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin), I must say that he said that these matters would be examined. I express the view that we are entitled to something better than that and that where significant issues arise in committee, it is an abrogation of the responsibilities of the House and a downgrading of its status as a legislative chamber when the Government is not prepared to give immediate consideration to the issues raised in committee.

         If the Government is incapable, because of either the capacity of its advisers or the capacity of the responsible Minister, to deal with those issues, the Government should postpone the treatment of the legislation until they can be dealt with. I express that as a strong personal view. I suppose the test will be when we are in government, as to whether we are prepared to proceed in this place in a slightly more sensible way which acknowledges the legislative responsibilities of this House.

         Further amendments are made in the Arts, Sport, Environment and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975, which, again to quote the second reading speech:

        It seems to me that it is self-evidently desirable that there should be that flexibility with respect to the management of our national parks which fall under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, and we warmly support that very sensible change to the law.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         However, there is an amendment of greater general significance which is important because it illustrates the positive way that we should be proceeding to improve environmental management in Australia as against the rather shambolic approach which has been a feature of recent years. Here I refer to the three international agreements which are added to the schedule of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 in respect of which the Governor-General will be empowered to make regulations.

         We have here an amendment which will widen the regulation making power of the Commonwealth. It does so in a fairly modest way. The three conventions which are being added to the schedule to the Act are in a sense supplementary and complementary to the five conventions which are already in the Act and which deal with related issues. Already in the Act is the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, especially as to waterfowl habitat, known as the Ramsar Convention because it was entered into at Ramsar in Iran in 1971. This convention has the explicit support of the Opposition and it is a matter where, as in so many elements of environment policy, there is no partisan difference or dispute but common support for that convention.

         There is also a convention concerning the protection of world cultural and natural heritage. There is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. There is an agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of Japan for the protection of migratory birds and birds in danger of extinction, which was signed in Tokyo in February 1974. The new international agreements which are being added are the Convention on Conservation of Nature in the South Pacific, which was signed at Apia in Western Samoa in 1976, the Convention on the Migratory Species of Wild Animals signed at Bonn in 1979 and the agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the People's Republic of China for the protection of migratory birds and their environment, signed at Canberra in October 1986.

         I linger for a moment on that element of the legislation. Here we have a clear assumption of responsibility by the national Government, the acceptance of which goes back many years, to periods of Liberal government and, indeed, of previous Labor governments. It is a nice example of a set of environmental issues which, of necessity, cannot be dealt with just by local action. We hear a lot about thinking globally and acting locally, but when we are dealing with species of birds which travel from, perhaps, Siberia to Western Australia, clearly local action in Siberia alone is not sufficient to look after the long term welfare and survival of that species. It requires action right down the chain of communication, if you like, the whole area through which these birds travel and ultimately nest and feed. It is simply necessary for the international community to take action. Therefore, it is important that Australia, as a nation, participates in these international activities and, in turn, translates the responsibilities which are internationally negotiated into local action at home.

         I raise this because we are going through a period of some perturbation within Australia about the division of responsibilities between State and Commonwealth and about the impact of international agreements and responsibilities on Commonwealth jurisdiction. I think that, in a sense, there is an unhealthy level of disputation and disagreement. I describe it as unhealthy because I think it is at a level which sometimes obscures and clouds dealing with the substance of issues. We become locked into what I have described elsewhere as arid jurisdictional disputes, rather than focusing on the need for specific action to achieve the desired environmental outcome.

         What is very positive about the example we are dealing with here is that, whereas you have currently a scene of conflict about some areas of World Heritage listing and the long term implications of that and you have conflict about heritage listing and the long term implications of that, with respect to these agreements we have a history of constructive and cooperative responses on the part of the States and the Commonwealth and, with I think only one exception, a reliance upon the normal administering authorities—namely, the States—to take the substantive action which is required in order to meet Australia's domestic and international obligations.

         If all of this sounds like gobbledegook, I am sorry; but I do think a very important issue of substance with respect to environmental policy is tied up in all of this. There is in the community a broad acceptance of the need to preserve environmental amenity and to preserve environmental values. I think there is virtually universal support for that in the community, but there is often unnecessary conflict about how that should be brought about.

         It has been the settled view of the Opposition over a very long period that to deal successfully with these environmental issues requires an approach which brings together the quite different skills, aptitudes and responsibilities of the States and the Commonwealth and achieves, on a cooperative basis, the desired outcome. We are strongly of the view that it is by pursuing that path that we will achieve the environmental outcomes that we generally seek. These conventions and their implementation over a period of many years is a very precise example of the sort of approach that we have advocated.

         We are at one of those points in Australian history where real progress is possible. Under the previous Prime Minister, there was the initiative to establish special premiers conferences which would do something to rationalise and remove some of the disputes in Commonwealth-State relations which bedevilled the environmental areas as well as other areas of government. I think there appears to be—and I must say I have to be a touch tentative about this because much of the work has been done privately and I have had to rely on various briefings from public servants and politicians who are part of the process; little formal documentation has actually been produced—reasonably clear evidence that the Commonwealth and the States between them have moved to a point where they have an agreement about environmental administration which holds out the promise of removing much of the past conflict.

         For example, in this chamber the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories—I am sorry she cannot be here for the debate on this Bill—said during the last sittings of Parliament that the latest draft of that agreement, which I think she described as the eleventh draft, had her strong support. Apparently that contrasted with her earlier concern with what I think she described as draft No. 2.

         The reality is that an agreement which provides that the States and the Commonwealth between them agree on standards and on means of meeting those standards and then agree to give full faith and credit to each other's standards and procedures provides a route by which we can escape the extraordinarily expensive conflict of the past. When I say `expensive', I think it has been expensive for Australia in an emotional, political and economic sense. I do not care whether one is looking at it socially, economically or environmentally; I think the past period of conflict has been very destructive.

         Here we are poised at the point of agreement. The States met without the Prime Minister. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the States met in a state of pique; they excluded the Commonwealth from their meeting because of the withdrawal of the Commonwealth from what they thought was the undertaking about the financial arrangements that they had been negotiating. The States reaffirmed their support for this approach to environmental management. The Commonwealth indicated, through the mouth of the Minister in this chamber, that there was support for it. We are here waiting to know whether we will progress down the sort of path which is represented by this amendment and the way in which these laws have been used to date; or will we go back to the days of Senator Richardson, where the environment is treated as a political football and the only thing that matters is whether the decisions will impact on the voting patterns in key seats in Sydney and Melbourne.

         Here we have a country with one million people unemployed. There is some quibbling about that; the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), with some satisfaction I thought, said today that it was only 850,000 or so. But whatever view one takes of the number of unemployed, whatever view one takes of the volume of small businesses which have gone bankrupt, and whatever view one takes of Australian society, unless one is totally insulated from the realities of Australian society one would have to say there are many people in misery and difficulty. For us to be wasting our national effort on unnecessary jurisdictional disputes is a disgrace. If we get a continuance of the total cynicism which has been adopted towards environmental politics by this Government, then I say that is part of a national disgrace which these people should wear.

         It contrasts very sharply with much of the decision making in this area. If the Prime Minister discards the proposed Commonwealth-State agreement with respect to the environment, we will have the clearest possible signal that what the Prime Minister is about is the narrow political interests of the ALP and that the kids of this country can go hang. It is a nice simple illustration of bona fides. Are we interested in solutions—in things which work—or are we interested in running up another green totem which might enable the Labor Party to wring a preference out of some dopey person who has not considered the actual substance of these issues?  I think that is one of the large questions that we face. I think this legislation, in giving us such a positive example, is a timely opportunity to debate some of these issues.

         I now move to the remaining parts of this Bill. We have amendments to the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986. The National Cultural Heritage Committee will be given the power to approve a recommendation without the need to convene a meeting. I understand that this simply ratifies past practice. In a very sensible way and no doubt in order to conserve public funds, the practice has arisen of trying to meet by telephone. In a country the size of Australia, when dealing with many issues I would have thought that was a very sensible provision to have in place.

         The final amendment to which I want to refer is the amendment to the Norfolk Island Act. It again seems to be self-evidently sensible that there should be a power for a deputy administrator to exercise the powers of the Administrator when he is absent from duty. People on this side of the chamber seem to get a dreamy look on their faces when we mention the role of the Administrator of Norfolk Island. It seems to be thought to be akin to being an administrator of heaven, or at least a small part of heaven, but I am sure it carries very onerous responsibilities. It is necessary for the Administrator to be away from time to time and it is necessary that there should be a capacity to do the duties of that job in his absence.

I would have thought that the Government, having supported self-government in the ACT, should not ignore local government when the Minister is being given a necessary power to break a situation where a decision is not able to be taken. We do not seek any capacity for local government to override the Commonwealth Minister, but simply an obligation to consult. I would have thought that it would not be beyond the authority of this chamber to make a simple change of that sort, which is completely in line with the whole notion of self-government—which after all was brought into this place by the Government of which the Minister at the table is a part.

         —I wish to pay tribute this evening to Mr Tim Neville, the former chief executive of the City of Knox. The City of Knox comprises some 85 per cent of my electorate in Melbourne. Tim Neville was the Town Clerk and chief executive of Knox for 17 years, until his tragic accidental death on Tuesday, 28 January this year—a man in the prime of life, still in his forties, and at the very peak of his activities and his career.

         He began his career in local government in his home town of Birboo North at the age of 17. He then moved to the City of Doncaster on Templestowe. In 1973 he was appointed the Town Clerk of the City of Hamilton, the youngest town clerk in Victoria. Tim became the second chief executive of Knox in March 1975. He was a past Victorian President and Federal Council member of the Institute of Municipal Management and chaired the William Angliss Hospital's $1.5m golden anniversary fundraising appeal last year.

         His time at Knox saw the city grow from a relatively small town of 60,000 into his vision of the most livable city in Australia, a title which the City of Knox won in 1986. Today Knox is the largest and richest municipality in Victoria, with a population of more than 130,000. Those people have lost a leader dedicated to their welfare. He will be remembered as an outstanding servant of the City of Knox and its citizens, a man whose dedication and enthusiasm knew no bounds.

Whatever he did or said, it was with the welfare of Knox citizens uppermost in his mind. Since his untimely death, innumerable tributes have been made to his leadership, vision, warmth and courage. There is no mistaking the respect and affection which he engendered in those with whom he dealt and worked, and his strong commitment to his family was legendary.

         Unfortunately, the editor has said that loss of peanut production in the last decade through non-viability of the peanut industry in the face of imported and depressed peanut prices would account for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of jobs on the land in country towns and in the cities, where most processing and packaging plants are sited. He criticises me and the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) for not stopping the importation of Chinese peanuts.

         It is unfortunate that the full facts are not put forward. The full facts are that in 1988 and 1989 the Peanut Marketing Board in that same area imported peanuts because there was a shortfall. There have been applications before the ADA in regard to dumping. From January to September 1991, only 18 tonnes out of 2,447 tonnes were dumped. The dumping margin was found to be less than 7 per cent. The dumped peanuts represented less than one per cent of imports from China and about 0.1 per cent of total market supply.

         The other important thing is that the total Australian production of peanuts was sold in both 1990 and 1991. It needs to be understood that at present $6.3 billion of processed primary products are sold overseas per annum. The complexity of world trade and the fact that we need to sell 80 per cent of our farm product overseas seems to be beyond the intelligence of the National Party and the hillbillies in the National Party in Queensland. That is disappointing. Over the last few months we have seen a campaign in Queensland by the editor of the

         It is unfortunate that the National Party does not understand that when one sends a shipload of beef over to the United States one brings back a shipload of oranges. That is called bilateral trade. One does not bring back an empty ship from overseas because that is not efficient. That is the problem with the hillbilly attitude that exists in the League of Rights, in the National Party and in South Burnett because they seem to think that we can ban the importation of products, put a wall around us—as we did in the 1950s—and simply sell overseas the products that farmers produce. It is a pity that they do not go overseas in order to understand the complexities of world trade. However, to his credit the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) has been overseas on two occasions with me. It is also to the credit of the National and Liberal parties that there is bipartisan support at the Federal level. I acknowledge that; I think it is important. But that is not the case back in Kingaroy, in the Queensland electorate of the honourable member for Wide Bay. I sympathise with the honourable member for having Kingaroy in his electorate because with Bjelke-Petersen there I would not want to have it in my electorate.

Tonight the floodwaters are receding from the Mary River, which will hopefully bring to a close a tragic week of flooding in much of my electorate. However, unfortunately it is again raining heavily in Maryborough tonight and last night there was a storm of up to five inches in Gympie which again brought heavy flood run-off into the central city area.

         The flooding began quite unexpectedly last Thursday night when a low pressure area developed and dumped inches on the little mining town of Howard. The small rural residential area of Pacific Haven was inundated and many people spent the night on their roofs while waiting for helicopters to rescue them. The rain moved south and, with more than a metre falling in much of the headwaters of the Mary River south of Gympie, it was not long before the cities of Gympie and Maryborough—which both span the Mary River—were covered in floodwaters. The central city areas in particular were badly affected.

         In Gympie, the flood height reached 21.4 metres which was equivalent to the 1955 flood, which was previously regarded as the worst flood this century. In Maryborough, the levels were not quite so high but it was the worst flood since 1974. With parts of the central city business area covered in both cities, there was obviously considerable damage done in each instance.

         As I went from place to place over the weekend looking at those areas that I could reach, I was enormously impressed with how organised the local people were and how well they were coping with the circumstances. It was a disaster but people were getting together to help one another, as Australians do in times of trouble. The police were fantastic; the orange uniforms of the SES were present everywhere; the radio stations provided a great deal of information; and the employees were there to help unpack the stores and try to move things to higher ground. In general, there was an enormous degree of cooperation. All who were involved are to be commended on the tremendous community spirit that was shown.

         Gympie, Maryborough and Howard have all suffered more than most during the current recession: they have had very high unemployment; depressed rural sectors; the young have been forced to leave to seek employment elsewhere; and the World Heritage listing of Fraser Island and the Great Sandy Region threatened some of the existing industries and cost many jobs. But the people have maintained an optimistic spirit. In Gympie, a lot of work has been done to develop a new and bright city centre. I hope these floodwaters are not going to damage the landscaping and advanced trees that have been planted in the central city area. In Maryborough, the city markets have created a tremendous spirit.

         Now the flooding has come to dash all of that renewed optimism. Many people are concerned about what the future will bring. John Yuille, a Gympie chemist, was quoted as saying that perhaps 100 Gympie businesses would not be able to survive the flood. Ian Campbell-Wilson, a local taxi owner, said that a few simply would not be able to get back into business because it all came so very quickly. The cleaning up is now to be done and the smells and the heartaches are still there. In a week's time perhaps some of the despair and the tragedy of it all will really hit home to the affected communities. I hope that the same kind of interest and support from governments, both Federal and State, that there has been over the last few days will also be present in the future when the communities will need their help.

         —Last Friday I had the pleasure of having an interview with a very important small business within my electorate, although I was not applying for a particular job with this enterprise. The proprietors of this business were concerned to relate to me their experience in attending a seminar hosted by a local chamber of commerce and addressed by the accountancy firm Peat Marwick about the possible implications to their business if a consumption tax were introduced in this country.

         This particular business is a small craft shop. The two proprietors prepare pottery and other craft items and have been operating in the area of Lawnton within my electorate for the last 15 years. It has been an extremely successful business and, despite the competition which has grown out of the large number of country markets and flea markets which have developed and proved to be very popular over the weekends and which also specialise in these craft goods, the business has survived and indeed has thrived. However, the constituents were so concerned, having listened to the explanation of what a consumption tax would mean to their business and what would be the imposts on their business, that they came and saw me a few days later.

         Of course, I was quickly able to reassure them that the Labor Government had no intention of imposing a consumption tax and that this would occur only if the Liberal and National parties were elected to office. They quickly agreed that this was a very unlikely event. However, what they are particularly concerned about is that the threshold levels afforded to the GST in having to register under the coalition's proposal would mean that their competitors in the flea markets and the country markets would be able to operate in such a way that they would not be bound to complete all the requirements which follow from trying to get the tax back from the GST, whereas they as an established business would have to do that.

The GST will actually lead to a reduction in the size of the Australian economy. Our economy will shrink. Even on the best scenario advanced by the Opposition it will not begin to show an improvement until five or six years down the track. That is incredible, especially combined with the fact that the tax will increase inflation.

         What is the solution offered by the GST? It will mean a reduced and declining economy, higher inflation and higher unemployment. That is what will flow from this package. Yet the Opposition has the temerity to go to the Australian people and say, `You know, here it is; here is the great plan for Australia's future'.

         —The Government's own Economic Planning Advisory Council in 1988 released a report inquiring into the processing of raw materials in Australia which cautioned against the use of government grants to establish or assist any new ventures. Yet in Geelong the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) is presently considering whether to bow to the demands of the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) to grant $25m to the German company Bremer Woll-Kammerei to establish a greenfields wool tops processing plant at Lara near Geelong.

         Let me make it absolutely clear: the Geelong region is deserving of more investment by private firms with its large skilled work force, the availability of a port and established wool selling facilities, all of which make it an attractive location for an early stage wool processor. The coalition would strongly welcome the prospect of BWK coming to Geelong. However, the company must not arrive in the city through a 30 per cent subsidy to its capital cost, as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) seems to be proposing. Labor calls this sectoral assistance, but it is really picking winners.

         BWK aims ultimately to export 15,000 tonnes of wool tops per year. Victoria has a labour cost advantage over Bremen in Germany, where BWK has 1,000 employees. A natural geographic advantage is also enjoyed by Victoria, as BWK's products have as their destination China and Singapore.

         Why has BWK not located here anyway since it first floated the idea in 1987? Would its seeming reluctance to make a decision have anything to do with the $36m in sectoral assistance that Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd received in 1989? Will we see Kodak revisited through a pacesetter for the wool industry? Kodak actually imports about 20 per cent more by value than it exports; hence it does not contribute to Australia's surplus on the merchandise account. Far worse, the apparent result of this assistance by the Hawke-Keating Government has been that small independents at the retail end are now complaining that their supplier has become their competitor. Kodak is now processing rolls of film for an unsustainable $4.25—unsustainable, that is, if the Government money tree had not dropped so many leaves in Kodak's direction.

         BWK's proposal could create similar difficulties. The effect on other Australian wool processors would be dramatic. Would they all put their hands out for similar deals, irrespective of their capital costs in the past? Even worse, this sectoral interference by government stands in stark contrast to the lack of a general pro-business environment for Geelong's small businesses, the forgotten players in this deliberately engineered recession of the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), who is now the Prime Minister.

         The Government should be looking towards helping business by reducing the severity of taxes. What about helping a medium sized employer in the Geelong region, such as Classweave Industries, which has to contend with paying out an extra 45c in every wages dollar for such items as the training guarantee levy, payroll tax, superannuation, WorkCare, holiday pay loading, sick and annual leave, rostered days off, penalty rates and termination payments?

         Geelong's small and medium sized businesses would welcome three steps tomorrow night: the training guarantee levy must cease; the mooted 1 July increase in compulsory employer funded superannuation must be replaced by voluntary schemes with more of an emphasis on employee contributions; and, in consultation with the States, payroll taxes must be abolished. These moves are far preferable to sectoral assistance, which treats business investors unequally. We should focus on how less government interference can help the thousands of smaller and medium sized enterprises in Geelong. We should get Australia back to prosperity and take the vital step of job creation.

        Ratification of the UNESCO Convention on Technical and Vocational Education requires consultation with the States and the Territories. The Commonwealth and the States and Territories are currently co-operating in wide-ranging reforms of the vocational education and training system to achieve more effective delivery and national consistency in approach. These and related issues have been the subject of review in the context of the Special Premiers' Conference on Federal/State responsibilities. Ratification of the Convention would be appropriate when the review process has concluded.

        (1) A corner stone of Australia's Migration Program is the long standing commitment to accepting migrants for permanent residence in Australia. Prospective migrants are required to comply with the requirements of any visa which may be issued to them. Migrant visas contain a return facility which allows multiple re-entry to Australia for a period of three years. This facility is activated on migrant entry to Australia and is intended to provide sufficient flexibility for migrants to settle successfully in the first few years of residence. This facility was introduced in 1987 and replaced earlier provisions which were less flexible. It is the responsibility of every permanent resident no matter how long they may have resided in Australia to comply with the requirements of the resident return visa regulations. Failure to do so may result in the loss of permanent resident status.

        The Racial Discrimination Act prohibits acts involving a distinction, exclusion or preference based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of any human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life. Indirect racial discrimination is also prohibited.

        In addition to the general prohibition on racial discrimination, the Racial Discrimination Act prohibits discrimination in specific areas, namely: access to places and facilities, land, housing and accommodation, provision of goods and services, employment and trade union membership.

        Australian Association for Marriage Education, Catholic Society for Marriage Education and Marriage Guidance Australia suggested that it should be attractive in design and that the AAME pamphlet would provide a good model. This was adopted and the new Departmental pamphlet complements the style of the AAME pamphlet. Those organisations also commented that a proposed draft was generally negative, problem focused and patronising in tone.

        Also they believed that the difference between marriage counselling and marriage education should be stressed. They thought that the pamphlet and list of organisations should be contained in one document rather than as two documents. However, this was not adopted because it is cheaper to produce them separately to ensure address lists of service providing agencies are current.

        Comments were also received from a number of individual marriage celebrants including doubt that couples felt the document was not necessary, although the celebrant supported the use of marriage education and counselling services. One celebrant from a rural area felt the pamphlets would not assist couples in rural areas with less access to marriage education/counselling services. A general comment was that the language used was too formal.

Some of these groups may also be welfare or consumer groups.

        Extracting detailed information on these grants would be a lengthy process and I am not prepared to authorise the diversion of the significant resources it would take to compile and list all such grants. However, all grant recipients for 1990-91, the amount of each grant, and the purpose for which the funding was provided are shown in the 1990-91 Australia Council Annual Report tabled in Parliament in the current Budget Sittings 1991.

        For these reasons a protocol for monitoring visits was developed via a consultative process involving Departmental officers and the Peak Bodies of all family service organisations. The protocol outlines the parameters of monitoring visits which are made by the Departmental officers to service provision agencies. It clearly defines the role of the Department and the Agency in all phases of the monitoring process, which are the preparatory, on-site and feedback/implementation of recommendations phase. The protocol was accepted by all Peak Body representatives in May 1991. It is the Departments intention to review and update the protocol annually.

        (1) The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) completed on 9 August a report on recent economic developments in the Occupied Territories. The report examined economic developments in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the period July 1990 to June 1991.

        (2) The 39-page report was provided to the Trade and Development Board of UNCTAD on 23 September 1991 and has been given general distribution. A copy has been forwarded to Mr Courtice. In summary, the report concluded that:

        (a) The economic impact of the Gulf crisis had a disastrous effect on the Occupied Territories, resulting in reduced remittances from Palestinian workers who were previously employed in the Gulf region, a strained labour market and a cessation in trade with traditional markets.

        (b) New restrictive measures imposed by the Israeli authorities, including a blanket curfew throughout the Occupied Territories from January to March 1991, had further complicated and aggravated an already precarious economic situation in the Occupied Territories. The main consequences had been immediate production losses in all economic and social service sectors, a halt to imports of vital agricultural products, the total loss of income from work in Israel and diversion of savings to consumption rather than investment. At the same time, the range of restrictive measures which had operated throughout much of the occupation period continued to be enforced—collective punishments, expropriation of Palestinian land and expansion of Israeli settlements. The introduction of a new system of security passes limited the number of Palestinians working in Israel, further contributing to massive unemployment among the population.

        (c) The Palestinian people implemented new measures to encourage economic self-sufficiency during the period covered by the report. This and other factors prompted the Israeli authorities to re-evaluate some of their policies towards the Palestinian economy and introduce some new measures. These included the approval of licences for a number of small-scale manufacturing, agricultural and commercial projects, steps towards granting permission to local businessmen to set up banking facilities in the Territories for the first time since 1967, and easing the restrictions on the flow of external financial resources into the Territories. Israel's willingness to move towards a liberalisation of its economic policies towards the Territories was also influenced by the involvement of international aid agencies in ensuring the smooth operation of local Palestinian development programs and by internal pressure within Israel to favour less dependence on Palestinian labour and the corresponding need to encourage job-creation within the Occupied Territories.

        (d) The report commented that, though relatively modest in the context of a harsh policy environment, these changes appeared as encouraging signs of an Israeli willingness to take steps towards a more liberal economic environment in the Territories.

The Direction places emphasis on the AFP enhancing its co-operation with other areas of the Commonwealth administration which exercise law enforcement responsibilities, particularly in an ongoing assessment of needs and in developing strategies to meet these.

        The processing time delays that would result from undertaking more extensive police investigations would penalise the vast majority of legitimate foreign investors, represent an unwarranted intrusion on privacy for most of those investors, tend to discourage direct investment from overseas and add significantly to regulatory costs. Any criminal activities which are uncovered during the screening processes are, of course, referred to the appropriate authorities for investigation and initiation of proceedings, as appropriate.

        The reason why so little of the information is specifically related to the number of couples participating in marriage education programs is that organisations measure their levels of service delivery differently. Some examples of measures used are participants, individuals, programs, courses, interviews and sessions. Additionally, some organisations provide service delivery statistics, but do not differentiate between marriage education and, for example, marriage counselling. A problem which occurs to a lesser extent is that a small number of organisations provide information on a calendar year basis which is not directly comparable to financial year funding.

        However, in 1990-91, my Department introduced a standard financial reporting format which included a section on levels of services provision. This source indicates that, in the 1990-91 financial year, 9,434 couples attended marriage education programs conducted by organisations who receive Commonwealth funding for that purpose. This figure was also provided to you in response to Question No. 1066. The breakup of this figure is as follows:

        You should note that these figures were estimated by the organisations prior to the end of the 1990-91 financial year and may vary from those in annual reports. The method of using couples as a measure rather than individuals, participants, program, interviews or other measures will also cause variation. In this case, Marriage Guidance New South Wales and Marriage Guidance Queensland have used individuals as a measure of service provision.

        The basis of the research is the National Input-Output Tables for 1986-87 published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The level of road charges taken into account was $353 million, representing a component of the excise on fuel used by the road transport industry in 1986-87, the year to which the research relates. The rate of excise regarded as a road use charge in the calculations was 12.72 cents per litre. This rate was derived from the ISC recommended rate for 1989-90 of 15.63 cents and adjusted for the lower level of road expenditure in 1986-87.

        (b) The ISC's recommended road charges were used in this research because they are the only comprehensive charging recommendations to have been published in recent years. Other charging approaches would yield similar results. This is because the aggregate payments by the industry would not differ greatly, ie the difference is largely in the distribution of costs, and therefore charges, between vehicles, rather than the size of the overall payments which is determined by the level of road expenditure.

This issue will be considered in work on the feasibility and desirability of a comprehensive road use charging system covering all vehicles. This work commenced under the Special Premiers' Conference process in 1991, and will continue in 1992.

        Part (7) of the answer to question No. 1084 noted that Minister Free attended a meeting of ASTEC in September 1991. Other Ministers for Science and Technology have also been invited to Council meetings. Other than attendance by Ministers at formal meetings of ASTEC, there are many ways in which relationships between ASTEC and Ministers have been maintained. Ministers Crean and Free have given addresses at ASTEC seminars and forums. They have made tabling statements on ASTEC reports in Parliament. Ministers Jones and Crean have requested that studies be undertaken; for example those leading to reports on the core capacity of Australian science and technology (1989) and on a proposal for an Australian gravitational observatory (1991). The Chairman of ASTEC was a member of Minister Crean's delegation to Spain in 1990. Successive Chairmen of ASTEC have met with Ministers for Science and Technology on numerous occasions, and the outgoing Chairman, Professor R L Martin, AO, regards his relationships with Ministers as having always been cordial and productive.

        (6) It is the student's responsibility to arrange their own flight reservations. For students qualified for student concession airfare rates, the Department will reimburse up to the cost of the student concession fare (75% of the standard economy fare). Students can avail themselves of discounted fares if they so wish. When asked, the Department will issue students with a travel warrant, taking into account the payment requirements for discounted fares. Students must apply for warrants within a reasonable time so that their eligibility for fares assistance can be established and the relevant documentation issued.

        (7) No. It would disadvantage students to oblige them to seek discount fares. There are generally a limited number of seats available at the discounted fare on any particular route. Demand for these is high. Significant cancellation penalties also apply to discount fares. The heavily discounted fares (those requiring payment within three days) are non-refundable. On other discounted fares, a 50% cancellation fee can apply.

        An inspection mission to Iraq of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)/United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) scheduled for December 1991 pursuant to UNSCR 687 was cancelled by the IAEA for logistic reasons and not, as has been reported, due to the IAEA's having insufficient funds at that time to cover the costs.

        (a) The cancelled mission was to have been one of a regular monthly series planned to ensure the integrity of containment and surveillance measures instituted by previous teams. Our assessment is that the cancellation of the mission does not have major significance for the overall activities of the IAEA in Iraq. The previous inspection, the eighth concerned with Iraq's nuclear program, was conducted during November of last year. The next inspection mission, planned for mid-January, is expected to go ahead.

        The IAEA, like many other multilateral organisations, is currently experiencing financial difficulties as a result of late or nonpayment by a number of member states of their annual contributions.

        (b) and (c) The Agency proposes to respond to the current financial situation by reducing each of its program areas' budgets by thirteen percent in 1992. Australia has agreed to a request from the IAEA for member states to bring forward payment of their 1992 assessed contributions. The Government is also urging other states to pay overdue contributions and to pay their assessed contributions promptly and in full, as Australia traditionally does. We have been consulting closely with the Agency Secretariat and other IAEA member States with a view to ensuring that essential safeguards activities are quarantined from program cuts and that the IAEA's crucial role in nuclear non-proliferation is not affected.

As previously advised in my answer to question No. 1161, parts (1) to (12), management of the assistance program is the responsibility of the Queensland Government, and decisions about what particular projects are to be funded will be made by that Government. The honourable member should therefore contact the appropriate Queensland Minister to obtain any additional information he may require.

        (1) Did the Industry Commission on 21 August 1991 report in response to the former Treasurer's reference on rail transport that (a) bulk commodity freight contributes about 55 percent of all railway revenues and is the only area of rail operations where profitability is either a reality or in prospect, (b) rail is suited for the transportation of coal and iron ore more than any other bulk commodity in Australia because of geographically concentrated production, high tonnages, relatively more certain consignments and its robust nature, (c) New South Wales and Queensland each accounts for around 48 percent of total black coal production, (d) operating costs for the NSW and Queensland railways together would decrease by about 22 percent with the introduction of best-practice costs in the haulage of coal and other minerals and (e) similar reductions can be expected for the costs of replacement capital, namely tracks and rolling stock, and non-renewable capital, including initial track, construction, upgrading track standard, electrification works and signalling infrastructure.
