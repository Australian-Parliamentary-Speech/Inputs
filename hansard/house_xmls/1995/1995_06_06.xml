But I do not see many from marginal seats coming in and extolling the virtues of this issue.

         The issue of debt and its management is a high priority issue in the electorate. This bill is supposed to be a mechanical bill which allows the government to draw upon funds to pay for its operation. In other words, the government requires bills like this to cover its holes in consolidated revenue. This bill allows the government to borrow more money. That is not unusual, but the government does it quite often.

         During the 1980s we heard all sorts of people saying that greed was good. `Irresponsibility is okay so long as we enjoyed ourselves' was the cry of many, including, it appears, those on the other side. Greed could lead to many things, but in Australia it has led to a period of instability and huge losses of funds. We are considered by other countries to be not quite up to it when it comes to financial management, which is a shame. The reason for this assessment is that the lead that Labor Party governments provided during the 1980s was nothing short of corrupt. The Labor Party just cannot seem to manage money.

         Let us take, for example, the Labor government of Western Australia, formerly led by the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), which lost huge funds during the WA Inc. period. It was a notorious period in Western Australia in which a former Premier and Deputy Premier were gaoled for theft of funds. These former Labor politicians, holding the highest office in parliament in Western Australia, played fast and loose with the state's till, and that state is now trying to work its way through the quagmire of huge public debt. The government was sacked by the people who wanted better management of their money.

         I had cause to survey many areas of my electorate recently and the replies were very similar to the responses that came back from a survey my colleague the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) conducted in his electorate recently. If they are similar in Western Australia to what they are in New South Wales, then the assumption can be made that they are similar in all electorates. The message is quite clear: the Labor Party cannot manage money and the electorate is concerned about it. If this message is being heard in marginal seats of the ALP, we can be assured of one thing: on this issue alone the coalition will have a resounding success at the next election.

         My research has shown that the biggest issue concerning the electorate is debt and the way it is being managed. The electorate rates the coalition as the only party which can provide the sound management practices which are required to bring back some sort of equity to all Australians. Mr Speaker, the fact that the government is looking for more borrowings should come as no surprise to you and the people of Australia. Racking up debt is the trademark of this particular government. Commonwealth public debt interest has increased a whopping 32 per cent—a figure increasing from $7.1 billion to $9.387 billion. Debt interest is on the way up. In other words, to those in the gallery, we spend $9 billion or thereabouts in interest every year.

         This, of course, is in stark contrast to Liberal managed states which will see the public debt interest decline from $1.1 billion to $0.6 billion in 1996-97. What a difference a vote for the Liberal Party can make in some of these states. The comparison with the Commonwealth is stark and frankly not very favourable. The simple fact is that this Keating Labor government cannot manage finances and the result is the explosion of Commonwealth debt. The $9.4 billion we will pay in public debt interest equates to over $1 million per day we pay in interest. Each and every day of the year we pay over $1 million. This $9.4 billion does not go to hospitals or roads and cannot provide Australians those much needed tax cuts that have been promised before. It is all going to the financial markets. Not one benefit from the expenditure of $9 billion goes to the Australian people.

         Members will recall that former Premier Kirner and former Premier Bannon both had problems with their banks. The Prime Minister seems to be following the Victorian Labor line of selling off the bank—in this case the Commonwealth Bank—in a desperate move to improve the figures. The government is selling off the cutlery, so to speak, to help it out of the financial difficulties we are now facing. But what sort of challenge are we facing? Most of the members opposite compare Australia to the G7 group, or the OECD or the other industrialised countries of the world. This is the modern cultural cringe they have: `My bank account is better than your bank account and my figures are better than yours.' But we are not truly an industrialised country, therefore comparisons are a bit out of proportion.

         Sadly, if one views our performance with other countries, the shocking news is that we are honorary members of the Third World. When one thinks of the Third World, the images we see are the poor and suffering of Africa. We do not naturally see other images. Some countries we may not think of are in fact in the Third World. These include Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile and perhaps even Malaysia.

         I say that we are honorary members of the Third World when it comes to financial management, and to support this claim I would like to present the following figures. The percentage of debt to GDP in 1984 for Australia was 15.9 per cent. In Brazil it was 39.3 per cent; Mexico, 47.9 per cent; Argentina, 30.3 per cent; Chile, a whopping 73.3 per cent; and Malaysia, 35.9 per cent. These were the figures in 1984, just at the start of the Labor Party management of our country, and it showed we were performing pretty well.

         In 1992, the percentage of debt to GDP for Brazil—these are the most recent figures available—instead of being 39.3 per cent in 1984, was 17.8 per cent; Mexico, instead of 47 per cent, was 22 per cent; Argentina, instead of 30.3 per cent, was 15.4 per cent; Chile, which was 73.3 per cent, was 15.7 per cent; and Malaysia, instead of 35.9 per cent, was minus 1.5 per cent of GDP in 1992. Australia in that same period has gone from 15.9 per cent of debt to GDP to 36.6 per cent. So in a period of 10 years we have gone past what the Third World countries were doing 10 years ago.

         It is time we started to get serious about our financial woes and begin the long march back to some sort of responsibility. But this will not happen under this government—or any Labor government, for that matter—because it just does not have the will or the initiative. The current account deficit has been over $12 billion for nine of the last 10 months. Every month we pay out huge funds for interest on past foreign borrowings. In fact, every month our current account is over $1 billion before we even start trading—that is, $1 billion going out and paying past debts every month.

         Even last week there were examples of the government not being prepared to make some savings. Last week we had two Auditor-General's reports highlighting the continuing management incompetence of the government. One report showed that seven per cent of the Commonwealth work force—that is, some 10,000 officers—are non-operational. What are these 10,000 Commonwealth employees doing? No-one seems to know.

Could you imagine a small business, for instance, operating like that—not knowing what your employees are doing and not worrying about your receivables? The point is that a small business run like this would close down. It reminds me of a similar experience of a former government minister who ran a sandwich shop. He did not know what his staff were doing and he paid the ultimate price. I think the sandwich shop closed down, and he paid the ultimate price of having to resign as a minister.

One of the reasons he was sacked was that he was arrogant and was never around the place when you wanted him.

But I should remind you that the second stage of the indirect tax rises will fall into place on 1 July this year. These taxes, which it was promised to us at the last election would not go up, will go up on 1 July this year in the second stage of increases. So we will have tax increases ranging from three per cent to 10 per cent, increasing prices of consumables out in the marketplace and in the electorates.

         The building industry, suffering from a sharp decline in demand—reminiscent of 1990—has been bludgeoned with a Keating secret tax, adding about $1,000 to the average cost of a house. So all the promises about lowering the hardship for businesses, especially small business, has been a great con. The biggest con is the way the government tries to explain the accounts.

         The Labor Party walks away from the truth, and we can see evidence of this within the budget this year. The coalition will be about real solutions and real decisions. The government has failed. It has failed to bring down a credible budget. It has failed to tackle national savings in any meaningful way. It has failed to address its own spending. It has failed to tackle the current account. It has failed to lay foundations for higher growth. It has failed to adequately reform the labour market to maximise employment opportunities. It has failed the Australian people.

         Medicare levy receipts as a proportion of Medicare outlays have fallen from over 30 per cent in 1988-89 to an expected to 24 per cent in 1994-95. The adjustment to the rate will ensure that Medicare levy receipts make a greater contribution to the cost of government health programs. The benefit to revenue of the increase in the Medicare levy is estimated to be $230 million in 1995-96, $240 million in 1996-97, $260 million in 1997-98 and $280 million 1998-99.

        The Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill 1995 will amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Act 1986 to increase the rate of fringe benefits tax in line with the change from 1.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent in the Medicare levy rate commencing from 1 July 1995. However, to avoid two different rates in the 1995-96 FBT year of tax the rate to apply to the year commencing 1 April 1995 is to be a composite rate of 48.475 per cent. From 1 April 1996 and all later FBT years the rate will be increased to 48.5 per cent. The benefit to the revenue of the increase in the rate is estimated to be $5 million in each of the FBT tax years 1995-96, 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99.

         Let me say right now that the coalition will oppose this Medicare Levy Amendment Bill and will call for a division on it. We will do this because the budget increase in the Medicare levy from 1.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent represents no less than another broken promise by Labor to the Australian community. It is another breach of faith that this government has dumped on the heads of the battlers of Australia—the working men and women who are not overly well off, who are struggling to make ends meet and who are striving to raise their families.

         The raising of the Medicare levy is not just a broken Labor promise; it is a serious policy miscalculation. It takes and it gives back nothing in return. Let me explain. One of the myths that Labor has sold to the community with some success is that we pay our Medicare levy and our health needs are taken care of. In other words, Labor has sold to the Australian people the false impression that the Medicare levy receipts cover the total cost of publicly funded health care—that the two sides of the Medicare budget in fact balance. Nothing could be further from the truth.

         If we look at the 1993-94 financial year, the last completed financial year, to get a picture of just how the Medicare levy revenue compared with expenditure on health care benefits, both public and private, we find the following: in 1993-94, according to the 1994-95 budget papers, the final estimate of the Medicare levy collected by the government is $3,030 million—let us say $3 billion. This is actually less than the contribution income received by private health funds in the same period, which was $4,150 million, or about $7.2 billion all up.

         That is just the revenue side. On the outlay side, in the same period of 1993-94, the final estimate of Medicare benefits schedule payments was $5.4 billion. The final estimate for PBS outlays was $1,670 million and, just as important, the benefits paid out of private health funds in 1993-94 amounted to $3.5 billion.

         Simple arithmetic tells me this combined benefits outlay for 1993-94 is about $10.5 billion and it is another easy calculation to subtract that amount received through the Medicare levy from this total payout. The quick answer is that $7,400 million of benefits, or 73 per cent of the total public and private benefit outlays, are not funded by the Medicare levy. This does not take into account the many millions of dollars paid by people who directly pay for their own medical or hospital care.

         The government has always tried to sell the Medicare levy as an essential part of its strategy to contain the costs of delivering health care. I do not dispute there is a need for reasonable action by government and private insurers to contain costs of private insurance as far as it is consistent with effective quality care and fairness. But I think the simple exercise I have just done shows how much of a confidence trick this is on Labor's part. Nor, incidentally, do many people realise that the revenue from the Medicare levy does not actually get paid into any sort of earmarked account. Rather, it finds its way into consolidated revenue.

         The levy has never been anything like hypothecated towards health care costs, which is why it is so dishonest for the Assistant Treasurer to come here and justify it on the basis of changing percentage of coverage of health care costs. Anyone who knows anything about the history of Medibank and Medicare would know the original proposals were for the levy to be set at 50 per cent of total expenditure. That was rejected by Treasury. So it is completely incorrect to come in here and attempt to use that argument.

         The revenue and benefits figures I have quoted to the House raise a related issue, one which this government has failed to grapple with anything like effectiveness. No doubt, as this debate continues, members on the other side will try to point to the wonders that Labor has done for private insurance through its recent legislation. I will simply point to last week's release of the latest OECD report on Australia which has something to say about Labor and private health insurance.

         The Prime Minister was very keen to crow about the OECD report. Indeed, my spies tell me that he was very unhappy that the Minister for Human Services and Health had knocked him off the front page of the newspapers with her statement to parliament. The Prime Minister was not crowing about this however: on page 125 of the report, after considering Labor's recent attempts at reform, the OECD says this:

       <para>
        In other words, the OECD says that Labor does not know whether it is coming or going in relation to private health insurance. I think I can help the OECD there. Quite clearly, Labor would be more than happy to see private health insurance disappear from the Australian health financing system.

         The figures that I quoted earlier cannot be ignored; if they are, it is at the community's peril. Given that private insurance contributions outweigh Medicare levy collections and private insurance benefit payments come close to rivalling Medicare benefit schedule outlays, one can see that their role in health financing is a vital one in quality health care in this country.

         And we have to face the undeniable reality that private insurance is under increasing strain as contributors drift away from membership at an ever-rising rate. In December 1993 the total proportion of the Australian community who had private insurance was 36.3 per cent. Over the 1994 calendar year this dropped 2.1 per cent.

This is an ever-accelerating rate of dropout. At this rate, private fund insurance will be not much more than one in five by the end of the decade.

         As the government knows, it has been reliably estimated that every one per cent fall in the level of fund membership results in an extra $100 million outlay in Medicare benefits. Or, to put it in a perspective that should have crossed the mind of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and his advisers in framing this budget, the $230 million estimated extra revenue, to be taken in 1995-96 through the increase in this levy, will be more than offset by the cost of making provision for the increased demand on public resources caused by the exodus of private fund membership.

         The recent Healthwatch survey conducted for the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia provides some ominous messages for the government in this regard. One in seven privately insured people said that they are more likely to drop their private cover as a result of this levy increase. If one in seven people left at the one time, it would take private fund coverage to well below 30 per cent. The compensating public funding contribution would have to come from somewhere. This levy increase that we are having today is not just a little fiddle; it is not just another broken promise. It is positively harmful.

         Overall, there is another question which the Minister for Human Services and Health put on the agenda by making a statement to the House about the findings of the Australian hospital care survey. That question relates to whether we are getting a quality health system in return for the billions of public and private financing dollars we inject into it. Elsewhere in this budget we see the government cutting back on the real level of grants to the states for the operation of public hospitals. Yet, if it says anything, the hospital care survey highlights just how fragile the balance between good judgment and error can be and just how easy it is to stray on the wrong side of that margin in the high stress intensity of hospital life.

         Quality health care is not something that can be delivered on the cheap. We on this side of the House recognise this—some of us from our own experience as health care professionals. As much as we realise the need to control costs, we accept that this cannot compromise the basic quality of care offered in our health care system. This decision to raise the Medicare levy yet at the same time effectively constrict both the public and private resources to Australian hospitals and the level of support for private insurance is both misguided and short-sighted.

        Mr Deputy Speaker, you will know that it is rising from a very high base. That indicates a stronger degree of satisfaction with that scheme throughout the community. It is certainly not the view of any member of this House that it is a pleasant task to increase any rate of taxation or levy. The Medicare levy is no exception. It has increased from one per cent, when the scheme was first introduced, to 1.5 per cent in the proposals before the House. But one cannot look just at the financial and statistical absolute level of that increase, the one per cent to 1.5 per cent—or, in the case of the most recent increase, from 1.4 to 1.5 per cent—over that 11 years. One has to look also at the nature of the outlays and the way the levy goes towards financing those outlays.

         The Medicare levy reached a peak with some 30 per cent of health outlays being financed by it. In 1994-95, had the Medicare levy remained unchanged, it would have financed some 24 per cent of those outlays. If the parliament approves the increase now before us, the levy will finance some 27 per cent of those outlays. So while the levy has had to be increased, it has only reflected the general trend in health outlays in this country and in all other OECD countries. I will turn to that in a moment.

         It is very relevant when one is considering the impact of the levy to also examine the way those health expenditures have changed and the way the Medicare levy goes towards financing those expenditures. It is not the case that the government has maintained, as a matter of policy principle, that the Medicare levy was intended or ought to fund 100 per cent—or some fixed, prescribed percentage—of medical and hospital outlays. That is not the objective of the levy.

         As the opposition spokesman in this area pointed out, the levy is not hypothecated. I would be very opposed to any serious hypothecation of these kinds of taxation levies. The levy has a specific purpose and it is linked to the health system and to health outlays. It is a matter of government budgeting and management priority to determine how that should be reflected in the overall taxation mix. Health and outlays for health stand on their own—they are an arguable case—and the Medicare levy which is associated with that, but not directly linked in a statutory provision, needs to be argued separately according to the budget circumstances of the times and according to the economic circumstances of the population of the day.

         It is very instructive to look back at the historical trend of health outlays. If we go back to the last significant period of coalition government—the 1950s, the 1960s and the early part of the 1970s—we find that, as a percentage of GDP in 1960, health outlays were some 4.9 per cent of GDP. That rose to the princely percentage of 5.7 per cent by 1970. From 1975 to 1985—I am combining a few of the figures—the average is about 7.5 per cent of GDP.

         When we get to 1990-95 we find that we have reached the point of 8.5 per cent of GDP in approximate terms. An increasing percentage of outlays on health expenditure reflects a change in attitude in the developed world. If one tracks increases in per capita GDP throughout the world along with outlays on health care you can see a very strong correlation between the two. It is perfectly reasonable that as the population becomes more wealthy, through increasing per capita GDP, it is going to expect an increasing share of that GDP to be given towards the kind of personal benefits which health care provides. That is a very high priority for most people.

         The OECD average is, at the moment, some 8.3 per cent of GDP. Therefore, we are slightly ahead of that. The EC average is 7.5 per cent, which is well below our average. The G7 nations come in at 9.4 per cent of GDP, reflecting the much higher level of expenditure that those countries have. However, I think you would find that many of those countries that have substantially higher expenditure, particularly the United States, fail to live up to the standards which we have set for our country and which the Medicare system has met. I refer to the quotation I read earlier which talked about a simple, equitable and universal system of medical and hospital coverage.

The recent debate in the United States Congress between the President and the republican group exemplifies the kinds of problems which we have managed to avoid in this country.

         Nonetheless, we are in the position of having to increase the levy by 0.1 per cent partly because of the proportional changes in health expenditure but also to ensure that the revenue side of the budget is also addressed in this context. That is why I made the point earlier that this is not simply a decision about a Medicare levy but a decision made in the context of not only the health needs of the nation but also the budgetary and revenue situation of the government at any given time.

         When looking at the impact of the Medicare system in this country, I think it is also very important to look at some of the ways in which it might be improved. We heard earlier in the quote about the OECD report that community satisfaction with Medicare is very high and continuing to rise. In relation to health expenditure per capita we compare well with other countries when we even up the issue of exchange rate variations. If we compare our health expenditure per capita with that of other countries in the OECD with whom we would customarily be compared and if we look at who is satisfied with their existing health care scheme we find that Australia comes out very well. We find that with Australians there is a high level of satisfaction for the level of expenditure which we incur.

When we examine Australia's position on the graphs of satisfaction versus expenditure we find that Australia features well in that area and that the present arrangements strike quite a good balance for the population of Australia.

One issue is the absence of any definitive policy from the opposition in this area. Since the time of the Fraser government we have heard statements about the opposition maintaining the Medicare system or the precursor to that system. We have heard those statements and claims and many of us regarded them with some degree of scepticism at the time of the Fraser government.

Whether they maintain Medicare, bulk-billing and the existing scheme, which Australians may or may not rate highly, is something that we no doubt will have to wait somewhat longer to see, possibly days before the election. I caution members of the public to look very closely at the comments of members of the opposition to determine what that policy is, if they are considering it in an election context.

It will ensure that private insurance is free to offer people much more innovative packages than they have had in the past. In the past, private health insurance has been like the two-airline duopoly. We have seen a number of private health funds offering almost identical policies at almost identical prices with almost no competition between those funds either in the prices or the services which they offer or in terms of the breadth and depth of those schemes.

         Such logic means that Labor could increase the levy by 100 per cent to cover the cost of medical services and benefits or by double that again to cover the cost of hospital services.

Expenses of a business nature are to be caught up in the net, expenses that never were and never could be—except in the eyes of a revenue hungry Treasurer—construed as substitutes for salaries to individuals and to entire categories of employees. In other words, the FBT is a tax on business expenses that are not, and never were, benefits in the hands of employees.

That latter tax applies to both large and small businesses if they are incorporated.

         There is the new twice monthly PAYE remittance arrangement, as well as the increased FBT rate—which I have just been discussing. On top of that, there is the increased cost of lodging company documents and occupational licensing, fundraising and acquisition schemes. To top it all off, there is the adjustment of the interest rate which the Reserve Bank pays on non-callable deposits, which banks hold with the Reserve Bank of Australia.

         All these proposals will add considerably to the cost structures that small businesses face and will make it much more difficult for a small business person to make an honest dollar. The fringe benefits tax has also made a big impact on the mining industry. This industry is, as everyone should be aware, an important employer in my own state of Western Australia. It is in fact the engine room for the west's economic strength and growth.

         The mining industry is particularly vulnerable to the fringe benefits tax because, with mines being mostly in remote, uninviting locations, it is necessary to provide incentives to attract competent staff and to pay a competent work force. Many of these incentives could not be defined as a benefit but are more akin to compensation for having to live in a remote location. In contrast, manufacturers can locate their operations more readily in or near major urban areas and therefore have less difficulty in attracting staff.

This can only be achieved by a meaningful attempt to simplify and limit the scope of the fringe benefits tax.

         The FBT legislation foreshadowed in the budget has not yet been introduced into the House—though, because it applies from 1 April 1995, the coalition has been expecting it in this current winter sitting period. We are still waiting. While the expected bill will reduce some compliance costs associated—thankfully—with car parking, taxi travel, entertainment and living-away-from-home allowances, the government will increase the tax on employer provided cars to 10 per cent to offset expected losses in revenue. This further confirms Labor's true agenda with the FBT. It has only been expanded over the years because it is easy to squeeze out extra revenue from that source. The other issue related to this coming bill is that it already applies, although it is not yet the law of the land.

Legislation by press release is an administrative action which needs to be avoided at all costs—and particularly in these circumstances.

In other words, more than half of the Western Australian membership is speaking in this quite narrow debate about a 0.1 per cent rise in the Medicare levy—although I suspect that they will all be speaking about the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence).

         Over the last few years I have found it fascinating to watch, inside and outside of this place, the Western Australian members of the Liberal Party and the degree of vitriol, venom and malice they carry within themselves, between themselves and towards other people in their state. It just seems that they never miss a chance. If there is ever a chance to bag the minister in some venomous way, over some distortion, they all jump to it—and here today we have one more example. There are five Western Australian members of the Liberal Party in the chamber; out of a total of six speakers on the bill, three of them are from that five. I do not think that is coincidental. I think this is part of the same tawdry tactics.

That is clearly what is coming through the body language.

         In 1988-89 the Medicare levy raised about 30 per cent of the actual expenditure on health. It is now down to about 24 per cent. This proposed increase in the levy is an attempt to restore that difference to some degree. For a party that talks about battlers and user pays, the Liberal Party has to face up to this reality: our community wants more and better services in health. We know that from the demand, from the polls and from the feedback we, as representatives, receive. How do we pay for that? Do we make the battlers pay all the extras or do we try to spread the burden across the whole tax base? An increase in the levy is by far the fairest way to catch up the increase in expenditure.

         Between 1985-88 and 1994-95 there has been a real increase in health expenditure of over five per cent. The coalition would put it on the battlers to pay for that increase. It would get rid of bulk-billing and make the users pay. The increase in the levy that we are suggesting is based on a capacity to pay—the more you earn, the more you pay. This levy is about being fair to battlers. We have heard a lot about them lately from those on the other side and I am surprised that, in the coalition's usual distorted way, we have not heard about them in this debate.

That is what the coalition would be arguing for because, if it were not, it would be supporting the increase in the levy as a way of maintaining the levy's contribution to health expenditure.

That report went into a great deal of detail about the use of post-acute funding and how post-acute funding works in with the community support sector.

         As part of the Commonwealth-state Medicare agreements 1993-98, the national hospital quality management program was established. It is aimed at promoting a national approach towards the improvement in quality of care. This seems to relate very much to the study results of last week, which show that we need to look at those issues. The Commonwealth has been saying for a very long time, `We have some problems in health areas, but they are administered by the states.' We have tried to use the Medicare agreements as a vehicle to provide both the money and the leadership to address those issues. The announcement of last week reinforced just how strongly those things are needed.

         We should maintain that kind of leadership and maintain a shift in resources in terms of the health budget overall being increased compared with other budgets.

The community is signalling to us very clearly that it wants increases in health. How do we achieve that if there is not some increase in funding? I presume the opposition would argue to cut spending. One wonders how much of the opposition's $10 billion of savings in outlays would come from health. One day the opposition may well tell us where, if and how. The community accepts that more services cost more money. The community is also aware that the levy increase is by far the fairest way of financing that.

One particular area is the rate of unplanned hospital readmissions within 28 days of the person leaving hospital. Another is the rate of unplanned returns to the operating room during the same admission. Those are the kinds of things we need to focus on desperately, given the concerns that came through last week.

In the 10 years since then, we have seen a much greater coming together of our systems across the country.

It does not fully redress the shift in balance of the levy contributions to the total health budget. It is still three per cent behind what it was six years ago, but the fact is that this increase is a fair way of approaching it.

Laborspeak for `The tax cuts are law—L-A-W—law' means, `We will repeal that law and forget about the tax cuts.' Laborspeak for `What I am promising is not to put up tax', which the Prime Minister told

        That is what the former health minister had to say. His comments are an indictment on this government. The present minister, the present Prime Minister and the former minister all said there is no reason for the levy to rise, yet we are today debating a rise in the Medicare levy. The coalition is opposed to the rise. There is no mandate to increase the Medicare levy. It is a dishonest rise, and the coalition will naturally oppose it.

         Essentially, the Medicare levy is an extension of income tax, though with alternative thresholds. It is a tax on one's income. Therefore, this tax increase is an increase in one's income tax. It reduces the disposable income of Australians. The government will argue that it will amount to only $30 a year and that the rise is necessary to cover rising costs associated with claims. Graham Richardson said that the levy, when at 1.4 per cent, was a hefty slug. So, at 1.5 per cent, the $30 a year rise makes it an even heftier slug.

Only 18 per cent had a fairly low or very low satisfaction rating.

         Notwithstanding those figures, I would query whether most taxpayers realise how much they are paying into Medicare and our public health system as a whole. The budget proposes an $18.4 billion health expenditure for 1995-96. Not all of it comes from the levy they pay. I realise that it should not. Many people are of the understanding that the levy covers our health budget when it does not.

         The OECD report to which I referred also included two other interesting and pertinent statistical points. Firstly, the major reasons for dissatisfaction with Medicare appear to be hospital waiting lists and poor hospital service, with 23 per cent of those surveyed mentioning those points. Secondly, the membership of private health insurance funds had fallen sharply from 50 per cent in 1984 to 39 per cent in 1993. It is even lower today. The Medicare levy increase will neither reduce the dissatisfaction of the community with Medicare and, in particular, the hospital waiting lists, nor encourage greater membership of private health insurance funds.

         The OECD report stated that there were 7.2 people per 1,000 waiting for elective surgery in 1984. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare estimates an average clearance time for the national waiting list to be 2.3 months; 40 per cent of category one patients—for whom, in the opinion of the treating clinician, admission is desirable within 30 days—on waiting lists have waited over 30 days. Of the elective surgery patients, all but one category—cardiothoracic surgery—had a percentage of patients waiting over 12 months to be admitted. That is an appalling statistic.

One reason for the large waiting lists is a result of increased reliance on Medicare. This came about, I believe, at the introduction of Medicare. People were led to believe they were covered by Medicare and as soon as something went wrong Medicare would cover them.

         Medicare was introduced to provide universal health insurance for all Australians. There is nothing wrong with that objective. People with private health insurance who could afford to maintain their membership of private health insurance dropped out, relying instead on Medicare. Many people who could afford to take out private health insurance—the Prime Minister and the Minister for Human Services and Health are two examples—do not have it. This simply adds to the burden on Medicare, with, barring levy increases, no additional funds.

         I give as an example what happened with one of my staff members. He recently had his wisdom teeth removed. From what I can work out, it has not made him any sillier. His dental surgeon said that, if he wanted the procedure done in a public hospital, he would be forced to wait for 18 months. He had it done in a private hospital and was in and out in one day. The procedure cost $650. His private health insurance gave him $458. He could have covered the whole procedure with what he had put into private insurance over the last few years and still be in front. He has now withdrawn from private health insurance. Had he withdrawn earlier and relied on Medicare, he would simply add to the burden and increase the average waiting time. This example is no orphan. A constituent wrote to me in February of last year:

        My wife and I contribute handsomely to Medicare via the annual levy. In addition, we are members of the Hospital Benefit Fund at the highest level, including Ancillary Cover. During November 1993, my wife Michelle underwent a serious operation at St John of God Hospital, Subiaco. The doctor's fee for this service amounted to $1,988. Medicare refunded $722.20 and HBF $240.70, a total refund of $962.90. We were thus confronted with a balance to pay of $1,025.10 . . . We pay good money to both Medicare and HBF and yet are still confronted with an enormous difference to pay.

       <para>
        The second case I mentioned also highlights the minimal refunds offered by Medicare and private funds. I suggest this is because the government takes a confrontationist approach to the AMA, which recommends the doctors fees. Medicare does not take notice of doctors. It dreams up its own rebate for the service, but still leaves a massive gap because it takes no notice of the normal charges of doctors—charges, I might add, which in the norm recognise their work and skill.

         But the main fact is that encouragement needs to be given for people to take out private health insurance and to keep it. If more people continue to drop out, it will simply add to the burden on Medicare. There are wealthy people who use Medicare but, if they need a procedure where they must endure a wait, they can afford to pay for it. One lady I know of, and I should point out that all of you know this lady—and two doctors rang my office and confirmed this—needed a cholecystectomy. The average clearance time for this procedure for all elective surgery patients is 2.8 months—that is, if you are an ordinary patient. This lady was diagnosed one day and had the procedure completed two days later. Perhaps being the health minister has its benefits.

         Private health insurance is important for the government to restrain spending. The OECD report on Australia talks of the ambiguous role of private insurance in the Australian health care system. It states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . insurance is supposed to be an optional add-on to the universal Medicare scheme, paying for choice of surgeon and better quality hospital accommodation. But if this were really the case, private inpatients would pay only the extra costs of more comfortable accommodation and choice of surgeon. Instead, they pay for total accommodation costs plus all other costs apart from the Medicare benefit for medical services. These contributions are estimated to save Medicare some $2 billion a year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report also, when dealing with the high level of activity in private hospitals for procedures for which public waiting lists are long, suggests that access to treatment is obviously not based on clinical need—rather, on the ability to pay—and, therefore, it violates one of the foundation principles of Medicare and undermines the equity of the health system. While the principles behind Medicare are excellent and worth while, there are still some fundamental problems. Private health insurance should be complementary to Medicare and not a substitute for it. Encouragement needs to be provided for people to go back to private health insurance.

         Graham Richardson, when he was the health minister, said that he would be worried if the number of people with private health insurance dropped below 40 per cent. It is now well below that, and the minister and the Prime Minister should set an example by taking out private health insurance. A recent poll by MBF found that 74 per cent of Australians believed that the Prime Minister and the minister for health should take out private health insurance, but they are yet to heed that message. Seventy per cent of those surveyed who hold private health insurance are likely to drop out as a result of the levy increase. The glossy image of Medicare painted by those opposite turns out to be a mediocre system when you apply the turps and see the real image beyond the government's claims.

         It seems that greater reform is needed for Medicare so that it does allow for private health insurance to succeed, so that individuals and families on higher incomes are encouraged to take out private health insurance and so that lower income earners, those for whom Medicare was essentially designed, are not forced to wait for admission to hospital longer than is desirable in the opinion of the clinician. Private health insurance is essential for our health system; therefore, encouragement must be provided which in turn assists the lower income earners who are competing for hospital beds with those who can afford private health insurance.

I am a bit concerned about the comment made by the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) that three Western Australians are talking on this bill, because health is a very important issue to all Australians and should not necessarily be limited to eastern staters. The reason why Western Australians talk about this particular issue is that we do care about the health system of Australia, and we do care about the health of Australians. For the member for Newcastle to say that we attack out of hand the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) is not necessarily correct, although I will be referring to that today.

As an example of that, the member for Newcastle in his speech said that we will abolish Medicare when we come into power. That is plainly wrong.

         The Labor Party belittled the faith the majority of Australians placed before it at the last election when they said, `Please rule us for the next three years.' In my view, the Labor Party has brought disgrace to the institution of parliament and lowered the standing of many fine parliamentarians who sacrifice themselves within this place to serve their country and their community. The Labor Party is but a shadow of its former socially driven self—those who were respected years ago—because now we really do not know when it is telling us the truth or when it is a distortion of the truth.

         This bill amends the Medicare Levy Act. But why are we amending the act? Frankly, it is to raise the Medicare levy. The reason a universal health scheme was introduced was to help those Australians who could not afford the medical system. It has been welcomed by many Australians, and the message the coalition has is that we will not be altering the basic bulk-billing requirements of the health system. It is working for a lot of Australians. In fact, the appointment rate has increased. The average appointment rate prior to Medicare coming in was about four appointments per year.

When former Senator Graham Richardson was health minister, he said that we should work towards having a private health system that retained 40 per cent of health users within the private health system and that, if we did not, we would create operational difficulties within the health system. Yet the number of people with current private health insurance equates to only 36.3 per cent. Over the year of 1994, the total drop was 2.1 per cent. But just in the first quarter of 1995 the proportion decreased to 35.6 per cent.

         At this rate we can expect that private health insurance fund membership will not be much more than one in five within a decade. Yet the former minister, former Senator Graham Richardson, said that we needed 40 per cent within the private health system. On its own estimates, the cost to the government is $60 million per year for every one per cent reduction in private health fund membership, but I am sure many people would agree that it is more like $100 million a year. This is an increase in the cost of health.

         This bill tries to regain some of these costs. But what sort of impact will it have on the battlers of Australia? This is a tax collection rort and a great distortion, because the Medicare levy does not go any way towards paying for the total cost of health outlays. We need private health users, yet this government seems set on reducing the number of members of private health funds.

         Last year the approximate levy collection was about $3 billion. The total collection for private health funds was about $4 billion. In other words, a total of $7 billion was collected to pay for health costs. How much did we pay back? Through Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits we paid out about $7 billion and in private health payouts we paid a total of about $3.5 billion.

         Simple arithmetic says that the combined benefits outlays of approximately $10.5 billion are a bit different from the amount of the total collections. So raising a levy is no panacea of problem solving. All the government is doing is adding it to consolidated revenue. This adds more to overall expenditure requirements, which seems to be a government requirement because it really is overspending in a lot of other areas.

The government has been warned that it needs a viable private health system, yet it continues to fail to act. People are falling out of the private health system very quickly, but the government still does not act.

         The bottom line is that, if we do not get supplementary funds from the private system, we will have to draw on the public purse. Quality health care is something that cannot be delivered on the cheap. The coalition recognises this. As much as we realise that we need to contain costs, we accept that this cannot compromise the basic quality of care offered in our health care system. Labor, by contrast, seems to have lost sight of this wider view of health care as it seeks to increase its revenue take on the one hand and screw down health care resources on the other hand. The decision to increase the levy is misguided in my view.

         Most Australians believe that health is important but it is getting worse, not better. If one surveys one's electorate, as I do often, besides debt management, health care is an important issue. Let me give an example of health care and how it seems to have gone off the rails. A constituent of mine, a lady called Anita Perceval, has a son called Sam. Anyone with young children will realise that an ear infection is very common in young children. Her young son Sam waited with a painful ear infection to get some grommets put into his ear. They were put in his ear, six months later they fell out, and he now has an infected ear again. The point is that he has an eight-month wait before he can get those grommets put back in, otherwise he will have to pay $500 up front to have them put in now to relieve the pain.

         Although the health system is universal and it does help most Australians, as the parliamentary secretary probably would agree, the point is that most Australians have to wait for health care. Why should a person like Sam, who is only three years of age and who is in constant pain, have to wait eight months to get elective treatment? There are some problems with the health system and we are not necessarily addressing them. Putting up tax levies is not necessarily addressing them either.

Australians quite rightly expect more value for their health dollar but they seem to be getting less in quality and less in quantity. The bill does not address the particular needs of health care. In my view it is a broken promise by the minister. Therefore, I support my coalition colleagues in opposing this amendment bill.

He also promised Australians that there would be tax cuts. We all now know, a couple of years down the track, that he reneged on that promise.

         In many respects there are very good reasons, or arguments, for abolishing the Medicare levy completely and incorporating it within the tax structure. That would be a fairly honest treatment of it. The Medicare levy is far away from raising anywhere near the cost of health care in this country. I have not done the calculation but you probably need a Medicare levy nearer to five per cent, six per cent or seven per cent.

         The fringe benefits tax, which we are dealing with here, has been a resounding success for the government since it was introduced in 1986. I note from the budget papers that this year it will raise almost $3 billion. I say that it has been `a success', but I am not sure whether that is the right way to describe a tax. It certainly has been successful in collecting a whole lot of money. There have been many inconsistencies with the way the government has gone about applying that tax, and the government has reversed some of those in recent legislation. However, there remain three areas of concern: the application of the assessment process; the application of fringe benefits tax to business expenses, which are not exactly benefits to employees—I noticed that my colleague the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in his contribution to this debate dealt in some detail with that—and the impact on the fringe benefits tax on the pattern of spending, particularly as it affects restaurants and the tourism and accommodation industry.

One of the problems is that this is higher than are some employees' tax rates—and that, of course, would apply mostly to part-time employees.

We now see situations, particularly where award requirements or deals are negotiated—enterprise agreements between employers and employees—that actually provide for certain conditions, where they then are clearly not fringe benefits. Yet there are still a number of instances where employers are being required to pay fringe benefits tax on benefits which are not in that sense benefits at all but are requirements of the employee's job.

         I will finish on that point. I am very pleased and proud to stand here today and say that we will vote against these tax increases. I hope it will be appreciated by the people of Australia that we want to restore integrity to the political process. I hope we will; I believe we will. I believe that we will not promise things we do not intend to deliver. When we win the next election, we will not have our leaders running around saying that things are other than they are. I want to see integrity restored to the process and, in my view, our vote today will be evidence of that.

         The fringe benefits tax legislation—I will refer to this very briefly because I mainly want to talk about the health policy, the budgetary policies and the broken promises attached to that—will only reinforce in the minds of many people in Australia, particularly in small business, that this government is intent on raising more and more revenue from the very people who will provide the greatest hope for recovery in Australia and will provide the greatest job opportunities for our unemployed, particularly our young.

         I also take the opportunity to place on the record again, in the few minutes I have, that on 26 February 1992 the Prime Minister announced in his One Nation statement that he would deliver tax cuts in two rounds, costing $3.5 billion each. He said that new tax scales would be introduced in two stages—on 1 July 1994 and 1 January 1996. On 9 February 1993, in another statement—the Prime Minister has a propensity for launching statements with rather generous descriptions of them; this one he called

        After the election, back at the National Press Club on 22 July 1993, the Prime Minister announced that `the tax cuts now legislated are to be paid in two parts—one in July 1994 and the second in January 1996'. In the August 1993 budget, the then Treasurer announced that the timing of the income tax cuts rate scale changes announced in One Nation would be altered but that the tax cuts would be delivered. That is on the record. What do we find now in June 1995, a little over two years since the Prime Minister made these commitments on 9 February 1993, when he reminded Australians that legislation had been passed through this parliament to ensure that his promises would be delivered?

         We find that in its first two budgets this government has, in fact, broken its major promises regarding no new taxes and has increased taxes substantially. I will briefly review them. In the 1993 budget the Prime Minister introduced new taxes to reap about $3 billion a year in unused long service leave taxes and annual leave lump sum payment taxes, it increased tax on credit unions, it increased fringe benefits taxes and it brought in an increased general rate of wholesale sales tax—up two percentage points. I remind honourable members that one per cent came in last year and the other one per cent comes in on 1 July this year. Those things are as a result of last year's budget. We have not even seen the effect of the increases in the budget being debated during this session.

         The Prime Minister increased the general rate of wholesale sales tax, as I said, by two percentage points. He put an extra sales tax on wine and cider. He increased petrol excise by 7c a litre for leaded petrol and 5c a litre for unleaded petrol. The country people of Australia, some of whom I represent in my electorate of north-east Victoria, would love to tell the Prime Minister personally how that has impacted on their family budgets, their businesses and their costs because of the extra fuel that country people have to use in their everyday living, let alone in their employment. He increased tobacco excise in the 1993 budget and introduced a departure tax. Those were the taxes that he said he would not introduce but were in fact introduced.

         Now in this budget, in this bill, we see an increase in the Medicare levy from 1.4 to 1.5 per cent, which he promised he would not increase. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) gave a commitment on behalf of the government that Medicare would not be increased, even after the election, even after the months when it was obvious that the government knew it was in a financial dilemma and that it was pulling the levers the wrong way in mismanaging the economy and had to stem the haemorrhage but was not courageous enough to stem the haemorrhage and manage the services of government efficiently.

         In this budget, apart from the Medicare levy, we see an increase in company tax from 33 to 36 per cent, which will raise another $320 million. I remind honourable members again that much of that extra revenue will come from small business, which has not, in many cases, recovered from the recession, which has depleted its reserves—most small businesses are operating on an overdraft and higher interest rates which have increased three times in the last 12 months. This government is now asking those people who create new employment in Australia to bear a greater tax burden, after he promised them he would reduce their corporate tax rate to 30 per cent. He now wants to increase the rate to 36 per cent.

         The extension of sales tax in this budget to certain building materials raises another $215 million and will impose extra costs on many people, particularly young home buyers, up to about $1,000 or so.

         With that scenario we then look quickly at the health position and we see that what the government is doing is adding to the costs of running families—in this case an increase in the compulsory Medicare levy. The direct effect of that will be an acceleration in the number of people who will exit from private health insurance. We are already heading towards 700,000 to 800,000 Australians who have exited in the last 18 months or so. In the 12 years of Labor government, we have probably seen in excess of three million Australians exit from private health insurance. The consequence of that is that it has added to the cost of running the Medicare system, added to the cost of the provision of public health care in Australia.

Consequently, it follows as a matter of logic that more people will be seeking public hospital care in the next year or so.

Many, not all, of those problems were attributable to hospitals being unable to cope with the increasing demand on them due to the number of people exiting private health insurance and looking for what the previous Prime Minister Mr Hawke promised on behalf of the Labor government—access to public health care whenever you want it because you are part of the Medicare system.

         As the Prime Minister said yesterday, essentially since we have been in office, after the first two or three years, the level of debt as a proportion of GDP has largely been stabilised. In fact, in recent years—in the last year or two—it has come down from a bit over 40 per cent to 37 per cent. Yesterday's figures showed only a slight increase. That was solely due to valuation effects—not to any underlying increase in debt in Australian dollars, but just valuation effects due to the devaluation of the Australian dollar.

         In terms of the future, obviously it is important that we get that current account deficit down. In the budget I have announced major steps towards achieving that. Those steps will involve our being able to tackle our not too flash savings performance, by way of improving our budget dissaving to get the budget deficit into surplus and to bigger surpluses in the out years so that we do not have public sector dissaving and that major drag on the national saving performance; and a major boost to private sector savings through the superannuation initiatives, which will certainly have a dramatic impact on household savings in the course of the next decade or two.

Clearly the markets are looking at Australia and saying that inflation is substantially under control—and of course it was a lack of control over inflation, going back over the last couple of decades until the latter part of the 1980s, which gave Australia a burden to wear in terms of higher interest rates.

It is something which is absolutely in place now. We have had low inflation for the last several years, and a continuance of low inflation is certainly something that the markets now expect.

         Members of parliament do enjoy certain privileges, and one of the most fundamental is the right to come into either chamber of the parliament and make statements without fear of civil suit for defamation. That is an important privilege which members of parliament should, rightly, enjoy. However, if that privilege is to continue to be enjoyed and if its use is to be respected by the Australian community, there has to be an exercise of responsibility on behalf of members when they avail themselves of that privilege.

The second, equally obvious, is that, if there were some grain of truth to these allegations, as bizarre as they may seem, the making of such public statements—an abuse, in my opinion, of the forms of this House—would prejudice to some extent the capacity of the Australian Federal Police to conduct an investigation without the subject of the allegations being forewarned and maybe taking appropriate steps.

         —My question is directed to the Treasurer. On 30 May in parliament you referred to the problems in the US `in terms of falling real wages and the vast number of working poor'. The unemployment rate in the US is much lower than in Australia. Real average weekly earnings in Australia are now lower than they were in 1983. According to the Union Bank of Switzerland's latest survey of prices and earnings around the globe, an unskilled builder's labourer in Los Angeles earns wages 90 per cent higher than a comparable labourer in Australia. How can you say to those labourers that this is as good as it ever gets?

         —What an absolutely ridiculous question. On 30 May I was referring to statements made by the US Secretary of Labor at the OECD in which he said that he was greatly concerned about the fact that the United States labour market had produced relatively low unemployment, which was a good thing, but at a price which he saw as being very high. He was greatly concerned about that price—that price being that there was tremendous disparity in wages within the labour market and that disparity had meant that there were lots of working poor.

         —That is the kind of outcome which is there in the United States. I am doing this from recollection. The figures produced in the OECD job study show that, if you take the wage at the top of the lowest decile of wage and salary earners and compare it with the wage at the bottom of the top decile, the disparity for Australia was about 2.23 times and for the United States was about 5.4 times. So there is a markedly greater disparity in wage outcomes. This means that within the United States there are many people doing very well and many others doing very poorly, even though they are in full-time employment or are largely employed.

This comparison of the real wages between two countries, of course, is fraught with all sorts of dangers, and one cannot simply make that comparison validly.

         The opposition is trying to imply here that there are some higher wages in the United States than there are in Australia. Certainly it is true that GDP per person employed in the United States is higher and that the wages probably on a translation across to Australia are higher. That is because it is the richest country in the world in terms of income per head. Of course it has got higher real wages taken as an average.

         The important point is that, if you are concerned about battlers—as you say you are—then the United States labour market is the one which does nothing for battlers. It is the market which produces these enormous disparities and which produces an outcome of large numbers of working poor in circumstances where real wages, which is part of Mr Reich's comment, had not been increasing for years. In the United States the median wage had not been increasing at all. In fact, the wages of many people were going backwards. That is the kind of circumstance which the United States government is rightly concerned about.

         We do not want to see here the kind of deregulation of the labour market which the opposition has called for over time and was there in large print in Jobsback. That kind of labour market, which would be produced by that kind of outcome, by stripping away the safety nets, would certainly bring about much more of a US style disparity in terms of wage outcomes than we have known historically in this country. It would certainly bring about large numbers of working poor and large numbers of battlers. There would be a lot more battlers for a Liberal-National Party government to be concerned about.

I thank the honourable member for asking me a question about this issue, because the impression is being created that Australia has large amounts of government debt. That is simply not true. Net debt in Australia for all levels of government is about 27.3 per cent of GDP in 1995 compared with the average for OECD countries of 44.3 per cent. We are at 27.3 per cent and the OECD countries on average are at 44.3 per cent.

         So, quite clearly, Australia's debt is well below the levels of other countries. I am talking here about all levels of government, not just the Commonwealth. If Australian debt levels were equivalent to the OECD average, our additional debt would be some $78 billion. The recent budget ensures that our debt will reduce considerably over the next four years. That is because we have moved to a budget surplus in 1995-96 with increasing surpluses over the out years—building from $700 million in 1995-96 to $7.4 billion in 1998-99. Those surpluses will lead to a reduction in Commonwealth general government debt by almost 30 per cent as a share of GDP, taking us down—this is the Commonwealth only—from 19.1 per cent of GDP to 13.7 per cent. These are very considerable reductions.

         On current projections, general government debt for all levels of government in Australia will fall to 20 per cent of GDP by 1998-99—bearing in mind that the OECD average is currently 44 per cent. This would represent a very rapid reduction in public sector debt by international standards. The only other Western country looking at substantial debt reduction over the next few years is New Zealand. I think it is worth the House bearing in mind that New Zealand's revenue to GDP ratio for 1995-96 is 37.7 per cent.

         The government has obviously taken the view that we do not need to have taxes that high.

         I will conclude by saying that it is perhaps useful for the House to note that the European monetary union has established a set of convergence criteria which member countries have to satisfy before the process of monetary union can proceed—before they can move into the third stage. Those criteria currently are: that inflation should be less than 3 1/2 per cent; that bond yields should be below nine per cent; that a general government deficit should be less than three per cent of GDP; and gross public sector debt should be below 60 per cent of GDP.

         There is only one European country that meets all those criteria at the present time—and that is Germany. Australia, however, does meet all those criteria. That, of course, indicates that we meet the standards of good governance established by the European Union for states wishing to move into the third stage—with a good performance on inflation, bond yields, general government deficits and public sector debt.

Our difficultly is in relation to the current account. The policies that have been put in place in relation to savings are fundamental to an attack on that.

         In the light of the Australian hospital care study, all of the other states have indicated that they want to work cooperatively with one another and with the Commonwealth. We have had an assessment of the effects of private health insurance changes on the state governments and also the extent to which they have engaged in cost shifting to date. What was seen from the Western Australian minister, although he did hear some of the discussion of ministers via telephone, was a typical shoot from the hip reaction which we have come to expect of that government in Western Australia—the cowboy actions of a cowboy government, its eyes off the ball again, out of step with the rest of country and increasingly erratic in the way it conducts its affairs.

         Mr Kierath says that he is interested in Western Australians and does not want them to suffer. I must say that I have not noticed that in any of his previous policies. Let us look at the facts which surround the claim that he is interested in their wellbeing. First of all, the Western Australian government should particularly look at its very dismal record on health expenditure to find the real causes of the problems. For example—and I will table the appropriate graph—in 1993-94, its first full year in government, state funding for hospitals from its own sources fell by 20.6 per cent in real terms. It took $100 million out of Western Australian hospitals. The minister has the temerity to suggest that he is going to shift costs onto the Commonwealth. It has already removed them.

         It is very clear that Mr Kierath either does not know what is happening in his own budget or simply refuses to acknowledge it. I think that what he is actually doing is shaping up for the upcoming budget because all the signs are that the state government intends to cut funding further. We have seen a 20-odd per cent reduction in funding from the state government in the face of a 31 per cent increase in Commonwealth funding. This in one draw and out the bottom draw policy is apparently going to be exacerbated under this new minister.

         This is an environment where Western Australia is growing rapidly and its revenue is growing rapidly, yet the government there is prepared to penalise hospital funding in that state. Taxes are going up as well. This is very cynical and tawdry politics and is very much at odds with the views of all the other health ministers. I point out that, far from being innocent of this practice, Western Australia has already attempted to cost shift by threatening last year to close down the radiation oncology unit at Royal Perth Hospital and pass on the costs, at that stage, to the consumers and the Commonwealth. Fortunately, we heard about this and the Commonwealth stepped in directly. We are now providing funding to enable a continuing radiation oncology service in one of our major teaching hospitals in Western Australia. In that case, arrangements are in place to recoup any additional Medicare benefit schedule outlays.

         That was a major boost to shareholders in this country and a major attraction for people to invest in equities. We then moved to reduce that rate to 39 per cent and then, later on, to 33 per cent. There have been major steps taken in the area of company tax to reduce the rate by some 13 per cent below what it was when we came into office and to remove the double taxation of dividends. In addition, the investment allowance, brought in as a temporary stimulus to investment—nevertheless, with the effect of cutting effective company tax rates—the development allowance and the 150 per cent write-off capacity in research and development, which is an increasing attraction for companies to undertake research and development and reduces their effective company tax rate, have been very stimulatory for companies in this country.

We made that decision to take it back to 36 per cent as a means of saying that, in terms of the current need for us to increase revenue, the best and obvious place to look is to those areas where major concessions have been given in the context of the recession and its aftermath.

         As also mentioned in the question, we are concerned to have a structural change in company tax for competitive reasons. When we reduced it from 39 per cent to 33 per cent, we had an eye on the rates in other OECD countries and in the region. Clearly, in looking at the possibility of increasing that rate again, we were concerned not to move too far away from the rate of 33 per cent because of those competitive factors.

         The movement up to 36 per cent still leaves us in the competitive range, particularly in the context of there being full imputation still applying in this country. We are one of the few countries in the developed world that gives full imputation for company tax. That is still there 100 per cent. The other allowances, such as the developmental allowance, are still there. The investment allowance is now starting to phase out but it is still affecting levels of company tax being paid.

         There is no ripping away of the benefit, as mentioned by the questioner. The fact is there was some reversal of that decision but only a partial reversal. In looking at the need for there to be fiscal tightening in this country, it is appropriate for companies who have high levels of profits, and had major concessions on their company tax rates effectively, to bear some of the burden of that increased need for fiscal tightening. In the circumstances that we face, the decision taken is thoroughly reasonable. There has not been a great deal of complaint from the corporate sector about it.

As the Minister for Social Security said in question time yesterday, the social wage has been greatly increased under this government, with a 75 per cent real increase per capita under us compared with a 17 1/2 per cent decline under the previous government when the current Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer.

In proposing this commission of audit, the opposition is following a well worn track of Liberal oppositions at the state level in this country. They have done it in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia. In every case, it has been used as a device to hide their real intentions to impose swingeing cuts in government expenditure and to increase taxes. In other words, they have said, `We can't tell you what we are going to do. We will have this commission of audit. When we have the commission of audit—from independent people, of course—we will know exactly what we are going to do.'

The member for Page has complained that about half of that increase should be attributed to the sales tax increase—that is, about $1,500. Why is the Treasurer deliberately targeting battlers, as identified by the member for Page, in the taxation rip-offs of the 1995 budget?

It is just a rip-off of the home buyer. It is deplorable if that is occurring in the economy at present. I thoroughly condemn such behaviour. There has been a lot of argument about what the actual impact of the building tax extension would be. The government has maintained that the minimum impact would be in the order of $300 for a very modest home.

It was contained in that speech plagiarising Des Moore by the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, when he got up, as the one policy announcement, the one proposition that he put forward as his response to the federal budget. He wrapped himself in the cloak that he loves to wrap himself in of deep knowledge of the budgeting processes of the Commonwealth. Naturally, one would be tremendously impressed. Naturally, all things are new that he proposes. Naturally, the government, of course, has failed to implement any of the suggestions that have been put forward—which are, after all, just the list he got from Des Moore of commonsense propositions in terms of accounting processes as opposed to his `uncommon' sense propositions in terms of what cuts he wanted to put in place.

         The protection of the public interest and the delivery of community service obligations, or CSOs, are just as important as the drive for efficiency.

         I am aware of concerns that community service obligations are under threat, that the disadvantaged may suffer with the removal of concessional pricing of water and electricity unless governments have effective CSO policies in place. Unlike the states, the federal government has policies on CSOs and, might I say, a proud record of delivering them. We have introduced competition but retained the universal telephone access and the standard letter rate across Australia.

This is the process which led to the Toonen complaint and the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill, which no doubt the honourable member recalls quite well.

         The standard requirement which this particular optional protocol calls for is to respect the privacy of the individuals who make complaints to the UN committee. Given that there are many regimes in the world where a complaint against the government by a citizen may lead to some unfortunate consequences to that citizen, one can understand why there may be such a requirement imposed by this particular optional protocol.

         I did become aware of the questioning of the departmental officers in relation to the disclosure of the general nature of the complaints. I have in fact advised my department that I did not think the response given by the officers was satisfactory. I believe that the Senate committee and, indeed, the parliament are entitled to be given certainly outline material as to the nature of the complaint, obviously respecting the privacy of the individual. I will ensure that happens.

         After reviewing Australia Television's revenue and expenditure, the ABC board considered a number of options at its meeting last week, on 31 May. Professor Armstrong, the chairman of the ABC, has advised me that at this stage the ABC board has decided to continue the Australia Television service. That is something which I know a number of members strongly support. The board has announced that the operational costs of Australia Television will be reduced. As an interim measure, up to $2.5 million would be provided by the ABC board to continue the service for 1995-96.

I would hope that an increasing number of members of the opposition would also indicate their support for Australia Television. This might be slow forthcoming, given the fact that the coalition's spokesman on communications has not missed a single opportunity to take pot shots at the service and the audience reach that it has established in the last three years.

         To refer to the second part of the honourable member's question, a very important initiative of the ABC recently has been the establishment of Australian Information Media, the ABC's pay TV subsidiary. Honourable members would be aware that AIM has already acquired substantial investment from Cox Communications and John Fairfax Inc. In addition, it has been able to secure programming and financial contributions from CNN and Nickelodeon to build up those two channels—the two channels being the news channel and the combined children's/entertainment channel.

         Honourable members would understand that the government has placed a pretty onerous local Australian content requirement on those two channels, and we think that, given the ABC's past performance in providing good quality programming, we can look forward to the start-up of these two channels. The government's support for this can be contrasted with the views of Senator Alston, the opposition's spokesperson, on pay TV. Senator Alston, in one media performance, made the following comment:

        So Senator Alston on that occasion had very serious concerns about the ABC being involved in pay, yet he is the very senator who moved the amendment in the Senate that forced the ABC to be involved in pay TV. Just like everything else that Senator Alston has said on media policy he continues to be incoherent and inconsistent, and we look forward to a new spokesperson some time soon.

         The first question, Minister, is: did you consider the evidence before you made your judgment on Hindmarsh Island, or is it true that you made up your mind irrespective of the evidence? Minister, did you ever have it in your mind not to ban the bridge? There were 400 representations, none of which you saw and none of which your staff member could have read in the short time that was available to her. Indeed, Justice O'Loughlin found that you had not considered the evidence. His judgment states:

        But, in my opinion, the evidence that had been placed before the court in these proceedings has shown, as a matter of probability, that the Minister did not give any "

        " to the representations at all.

       <para>
        Minister, you said you made up your mind on the Saturday morning, 9 July, to ban the Hindmarsh Island bridge. What evidence do we have that you made your mind up after considering all the evidence? We have none, because you have produced none. But we have lots of evidence to suggest that you had already made up your mind before the Saturday.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         First of all, there is the fax on 7 July to the Office of Legislative Drafting confirming that the declaration would be for 25 years. It is true that Justice O'Loughlin has considered this, but let us consider it a little bit further, shall we? How on 7 July, if you did not make up your mind until 9 July, could your office fax to the draftsperson that the declaration would be for 25 years? Presumably, Minister, because declarations are usually for 25 years. Is that true? Minister, when we go back to your previous two declarations, what do we find? Twenty years and five years. So, if this was just a draft declaration in case you had to make it, why did we not go by past precedents?

         There is something else. Is it not true that ATSIC had recommended a ban for four years on this Hindmarsh Island issue on 7 July? Here we have previous declarations made for 20 and five years, ATSIC recommends four; and what does the minister do: he puts out a draft that says the declaration will be for 25 years. This is somebody who has not made up his mind. Did he ask for two drafts, one maybe for five or 10 and one for 25? No, just the one for 25. That is the first piece of evidence.

         Second, there are I believe five statutory declarations—and I am sure another member could produce the three if you would like them tabled—which state that on Friday night, 8 July, at an Aboriginal ball a statement was made that the Hindmarsh Island bridge would be stopped, the information coming either from you or from your office. How could that announcement be made at an Aboriginal ball if you had not conveyed that information? Was the person who said it not telling the truth? Why would anybody get up in front of a ball and say that if it were not the truth? There are five statutory declarations. The person supposed to have made the declaration has not denied it—and funny, Minister, I have not really heard you deny it.

         —That you had told this parliament that you had not made up your mind on 10 July at 10 a.m., or close to 10 a.m., when you spoke to the Premier. That was your defence on Thursday to the allegations made against you. What did Premier Dean Brown say? He said, `I was so convinced that the minister had made up his mind that I called the Prime Minister and tried to speak to him.' So much for Thursday's defence. In conclusion, you made up your mind before seeing the evidence. In fact, you had never any other intention but to ban the bridge.

         Let us have a look at something even a little more serious than this, and that is the declaration itself. When we look at the declaration, the story becomes curiouser and curiouser. First of all, we have the declaration that you are to sign faxed from your Canberra office to your home in Sydney. It is faxed there. You get the fax and you sign it with your signature to send it back.

         What happens to this fax in your home, Minister? It has disappeared. It has been suggested that the baby ate it. Is this the way you conduct your official business? Do you have a dog? If you have a dog, do we conclude that the dog could have eaten it as well? An official fax disappears from your home. What is more, there is not one fax log record to show what time that fax arrived. What happens next? The minister has signed it, then it gets lost. But it is faxed before it is lost back to the Canberra office with the date and time on it. This is the second record. We have lost the first; now we have got a record as it goes back to the Canberra office. What does the Canberra office do with it? It cuts the top off it. Minister, do you always cut the tops off your faxes?

So you know what is at stake, but your office cuts the tops off the faxes. You then fax the mutilated copy off to the Gazette. What does your office then do with that fax it has just faxed off? It loses it. It loses the next fax. The lawyers asked for it, appealed for evidence, and no-one can find it. ATSIC does not have it; you do not have it; and your office does not have it.

Surely, it is important for the minister that, when Aboriginal people rediscover their traditions and culture that have been lost through dispossession, forced resettlement and migration, they discover the truth. To suggest otherwise is to debase those traditions and that culture.

         Any person interested in the truth and anyone concerned with the integrity of Aboriginal culture and its preservation would surely want such claims investigated. Yet an investigation has been denied, even condemned, by you, Minister. To dismiss the concerns of Dorothy and Dulcie Wilson, Bertha Gollan and other senior Aboriginal women as unimportant and irrelevant must be one of the strangest sleights of hand perpetuated by a minister who claims to support all Aboriginal people.

         Under the guise of supporting Aboriginal people, you have taken sides and you have deliberately disempowered one group of Aboriginal women. Certainly, Dorothy Wilson must be today contemplating the high personal cost she has had to pay. She might ask: why is the minister not prepared to speak out against her vilification? Why is he so silent about what has  happened to the most defenceless of Aboriginal people? What does the minister suggest is her motive for speaking out—money, glory, fame? Perhaps, Minister, it is the desire for truth.

         —All over Australia Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are quivering in their boots at the prospect that the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) might one day assume the office of Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. The fact is that on every single occasion that the coalition has a choice between defending the heritage values of indigenous Australians and supporting other interests—whether they be developers or someone else—the coalition supports the bulldozer above the rights of indigenous people. We have seen a tawdry track record from the coalition in dealing with this Hindmarsh Island bridge issue within the parliament and outside the parliament. In the course of my remarks, I am going to say something about the opposition's conduct in dealing with that issue.

         First of all, let me put on the public record that my actions in this matter, in issuing the declaration to protect the area from desecration, have been supported by no lesser authority than the Commonwealth parliament. Both houses of the Commonwealth parliament have endorsed my actions and have refused to support the disallowance motion moved and supported by the coalition in both houses. I can say to indigenous people that, when I speak, I speak with the support of the parliament. They ought not to think that because the coalition in this place refuses to stand up for their interests the rest of us do not care about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage and are not prepared to speak out and stand up for what is right.

Yes, this is true, but this is also a matter that has been considered by the Federal Court of Australia. Mr Justice O'Loughlin made it clear that the decision maker in this matter was not some bureaucrat and not some staff member but me as the relevant federal minister. It was my decision. How did I issue a declaration different to some of the advice put to me by some of the bureaucrats? I had regard to the Saunders report. If you look at the Saunders report, you will see that she did not support a declaration for a limited period.

If the South Australian Premier had said to me, `Look Robert, we will have a cooling off period. We will call off the threat,' then things might have been a bit different. But that was not what it was about. My best recollection of what the judge said in relation to this matter was that it would be a dereliction of my duty if I did not act in such a way as to ensure that there was no gap between the expiry of a section 9 declaration and the issue of a section 10 declaration. He said that I used a prudent course of action in ensuring the preparation of a draft declaration.

What area of public policy is significant for the coalition to address among key issues of public policy as we go to the election? It would have to be Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, which led to the member for Mayo perishing as the Leader of the Opposition. But it is eight months since the member for Hindmarsh promised the public that she would come forward with a policy in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. It has been eight months since the former policy sank in the deserts of central Australia. Eight months later, we have not heard one word of policy.

However, Premier Brown rang him on the morning of 9 July, and the phone call finished at about 11.08 Eastern Standard Time. Talk about giving somebody a cooling-off period! After the Premier of the state had given his best view, the minister gave him a cooling-off period of seven minutes. He then rang up his adviser and said, `Make the declaration.' The truth of the matter is that he made that decision days before. Everybody knows that he made it days before, including Mrs Doreen Kartinyeri who announced it at a ball in Adelaide the previous night. It is absolute nonsense for the minister to get up here and say that those things had not been done.

         I want to take this minister not only to the matter I have just raised, or to the matter of the auto scissors cutting the top of the fax off, or to the matter that he has a whiteboard fax machine which manages to dispose of faxes either into the nappy or out with the baby's bathwater, but also to the very fact that this matter started back on 9 May because some men from the Lower Murray Aboriginal Heritage Committee asked 15 Ngarrindjeri women from Murray Bridge to come to a meeting. The purpose of the meeting was because, in their view, the report done by anthropologist Neale Draper—and the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) has a copy of that report, she was quoting from it here in November; I do not have a copy but she has—was not good enough for them to get a declaration made. That was the purpose of the meeting.

         So they invited 15 women along and said, `We've got a lady called Doreen Kartinyeri and she is going to tell you what the women's business is about.' She told them that Hindmarsh Island was a place where white men's babies had been aborted and so forth. So they wrote a letter to the minister on that basis without describing the exactitude of that. They went to the other side of the island and the people from the Aboriginal legal movement said, `That's not good enough.' So they wrote some more words.

         Mrs Kartinyeri is seminal to this debate because, as Cheryl Saunders said in her report, `She is a Ngarrindjeri elder whose knowledge about the women's business central to this report came from her grandmother and her Aunt Rosie, her mother's older sister.' The second invaluable point in this discussion is that three days later, in a letter dated the 12th that the minister had and still has, Doreen Kartinyeri said two things. She said, `I have recently become aware of the exact place to which this women's business refers.' Of course, it was Hindmarsh Island. She quoted three sources: her grandmother, long since dead; Laura Kartinyeri, currently known as Nanna Laura; and her Aunt Rosie, who died in 1981. So there was only one person alive who was the source of her information. Remember, she was quoted in the Saunders report as `the person who is central to this report'.

But the one person who knew—and his office knew—after he read the report, albeit in a couple of days, which he received on 7 July, that the only person alive who could have verified the women's business was never asked.

         So if you call that doing the job in detail and changing 140 years of anthropological history on the basis of it then that is the sort of detail that this minister went to. And he will not answer that question. He had two letters—one on 9 May and one on 12 May—which played a formative part in his appointing Cheryl Saunders, which he did on 23 May. He took notice, presumably, of the fact that a woman should do the thing, because the letters to him referred to women's business. When Cheryl Saunders' report came up, the one woman on earth who could have verified the truth or otherwise of this thing was not asked.

         Unfortunately for this minister, a woman by the name of Dorothy Wilson was at that first meeting. She signed the first letter saying that she thought it was a sacred place and so forth. But on her way home that night she thought more about it and it worried her. She went to see Nanna Laura—Mrs Laura Kartinyeri, who was 88 years old last year and perfectly healthy at that time—and she asked her about the women. Remember, Nanna Laura is the most senior elder and known amongst the Ngarrindjeri people as that. Dorothy Wilson asked her whether it was true, and she was told that it was rubbish. The old lady had never heard of it.

This issue has for a long time battled the consciences of these women who have now come out after a long time, because they realised it would cause disruption amongst the people in the Ngarrindjeri group. But they have at least put honour back into this operation. I have to say that, if this minister is not an accomplice in this operation, he is probably compliant in some sort of conspiracy. He has not answered the questions that he should have answered. I did not hear him answer one single question.

The fact of the matter is that he has not done the work, and this minister is going to lose out over this matter.

         —I am embarrassed that we have had to hear the opposition members this afternoon, because it has been a pitiful attack. We need to understand that this is not about an attack on the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). The interesting thing about this is that the fundamental element in all of this is misogynism. The common element is that this inquiry into the Hindmarsh Island bridge was carried out by a woman, who was disparaged by the opposition and disparaged by the member for Mayo (Mr Downer). The member for Mayo happened to say just a while ago in an aside across the table, `We shouldn't trust her because she might be married to a Labor member of parliament.' I don't know if she is or she isn't. You implied that she should not be trusted; that Cheryl Saunders, an independent person, should not be treated as an independent. We heard you.

Three women have come under intense attack in a variety of guises, the most common being an attack from the opposition on either their independence—in the case of Professor Saunders and Dr Fergie—or their authenticity, in the case of Mrs Doreen Kartinyeri. This attack has come from three people—the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the member for Mayo and a number of his acolytes, including some who purport to be journalists, such as Piers Ackerman and other people writing in South Australian newspapers.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, I am happy to refer to him as the Leader of the Opposition—a pretender at most. Again in this interview with Alan Jones, in relation to the independence of the inquiry which had been taken, he said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        I mean, what a government should do is abort the appeal and have a proper independent inquiry—not some politically correct acolyte running it but some independent individual who can examine the truth of it.

       <para>
        He is saying, is he not, that Professor Saunders is an acolyte of the Labor Party? Is that what he is saying? He is undermining her independence. Yet the shadow minister sits at this table trying to defend not only the Leader of the Opposition but also the member for Barker, the member for Mayo and all those other people who have made judgments, and she maintains that she has not made a judgment. The shadow minister has said, `I have not made a judgment about the veracity or otherwise of the claims made by either side.' That is not a position which has been adopted by the Leader of the Opposition, that is not a position which has been adopted by the member for Barker, that is not a position which has been adopted by the member for Mayo and that is not a position which has been adopted by our opponents. It is a position which has been adopted by the shadow minister—a shadow minister who has been duped into a position where she has been overrun like a mad train by the member for Barker who has gone out and colluded with his mates to try to concoct a story.

         The main elements of the proposed works are the implementation of a staged program of internal refurbishment providing tenancy conditions which meet the requirements of occupational health and safety with the replacement of outdated and obsolete equipment and providing office accommodation which meets current data and communications needs, and the refurbishment of areas surplus to high commission requirements for leasing to state governments and other agencies. Total estimated cost for the works as at May 1994 prices is $A14.25 million. To meet the timetable for linking Australia House with the new DFAT offices at York Park, some interim works have commenced.

          —I think that is a broad hint. Until this legislation is amended to enable site inspections to be carried out overseas, the committee continues to reluctantly give approval for construction of projects which it has been unable to properly assess. The Public Works Committee Act 1969 be amended to remove the restriction on the Public Works Committee meeting outside of Australia and its external territories. There is a need to retain Australia House, London, as the focal point of Australia's representational activities in the United Kingdom. There is a need to refurbish the interior of Australia House, London, as proposed by the Overseas Property Group, as much of the existing office accommodation is in poor condition and does not meet the needs of a modern working environment. In addition, many of the building's surfaces need replacing, as they no longer meet current regulatory requirements.

I am sympathetic to the view that there would be advantages to the committee's consideration of overseas projects if it was able to gain some first-hand, on-site knowledge of them. There are some legal impediments to the committee conducting hearings overseas which cannot be dealt with by simply amending the act.

          —Stoke House is too small to put a block of flats on, I should think. All of the other flats have been sold and, consequently, I think one needs to take a long-term view of real estate values in London, which are obviously going to go up and not down. Australia's presence in that city will obviously continue indefinitely. Therefore, I think we need to take a long-term approach to these issues, not just on an annual budgetary cycle basis. As I said, the opposition does not oppose the proposal and we shall watch future developments with interest.

          I point out to the honourable member for Bradfield the general difficulty of dealing with accommodation. The configuration of the building, with a well in the middle and the matter of the windows, makes it virtually impossible to do that. Even with this work, there will still be several vacant floors. We have been concerned about that vacant accommodation. The real difficulty we face is that the office market in London is oversupplied. We had to spend $14 million to bring those three floors up to rentable standard. A real difficulty we face is that we have to spend quite a lot of money on those buildings to bring them up to a standard for letting.

          The committee looked very carefully at turning part of the building into flats. It really is not practical. That is why we suggested in the final analysis that part of the sixth floor be converted to transit accommodation, but only transit accommodation. It is not suitable as long-term accommodation, with people having to live where they work and the configuration of the building being such.

         —The thesis I was putting to the House before question time was that as a consequence of the increase in taxation, not only in this Medicare Levy Bill but also in respect of the Keating government's increases in tax in previous budgets and this budget, many more families are going to be forced out of continuing private health insurance. That will put greater pressure on the public hospital sector and will increase costs. Therefore, the merry-go-round will continue with increasing demand on taxpayers' funds to sustain Medicare. The government has produced a giant haemorrhage and that can only get worse under the government's policy.

         The trajectory of this government in budgets up to the current budget has been to increase taxes in Australia, despite a promise not to increase taxes, by around $3 billion a year.

The first is to increase company tax from 33 per cent to 36 per cent, which will take $3,970 million out of the private sector—money to invest in jobs and in the expansion of business and industry in Australia—over the next four years.

That amount of money would be otherwise spent by those families in looking after themselves, being self-sufficient and, for many of them, continuing to pay private health insurance instead of being totally reliant on public health schemes, at a greater cost to the taxpayer.

         The extension of sales tax on building materials will raise a total of $1,015 million over four years. Again, let us pause to reflect where that money is going to come from. Predominantly, it will come from young people who are trying to get their first home, who will now have to pay hundreds of dollars—according to one of the Labor members during question time, at least $1,500—per modest home for wholesales sales tax on building materials not presently covered by the wholesales sales tax legislation.

         In respect of passenger motor vehicles used predominantly by families, by battlers in Australia, by small business, again I remind members on the other side, the sales tax proposals in this budget propose to raise $1,470 million over the next four years. The consequences of taking those vast sums of money out of families, out of the productive side of the economy, out of small business are clear—that can only result in less investment, less savings and more demands on the public purse.

         It is obvious that that is the case when you consider the tax base that we already have and the fact that these people have had to suffer high interest rates during a massive recession and now regretfully a return to higher interest rates with three interest rate hikes over the past 12 months. If, as I fear, we follow the trend of the American economy, and with our huge debt and therefore the forces at work on the Australian economy, we are going to find, perhaps in the very short term, a slight dip in interest rates followed by a rise in interest rates as this government, if it is still in power—heaven forbid—grapples with the levers of managing this economy in the clumsy way that it has over the past 12 or 13 years.

You would be interested to know that the Medicare levy receipts, as a proportion of Medicare outlays, have fallen from over 30 per cent in 1988-89 to an expected 24 per cent in 1994-95. This increase in the Medicare levy does not even make up for that fall; it only partially makes up for that decline. We had lectures from members opposite about fiscal responsibility and about responsibility and the management of the resources of the nation. What sort of responsibility do they show whenever they have to make a hard decision, such as a very small increase in the Medicare levy? What do they do? They run away from it and then they want to vote against it here and in the other place. That is a disgrace.

After five election losses by the coalition parties in which Medicare was a central issue and in which health policy was a central issue, they finally recognise that the Australian people actually like Medicare, the Australian people support Medicare, the Australian people think Medicare is a very good policy. It is a lot for them to swallow, given their philosophical predilection, especially the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). It was very difficult for him to swallow. He said, `I support Medicare.' That was one of the hardest things he has ever had to do in politics. Given his new right philosophical basis—he does not believe in anything universal, especially universal health care—it was a very difficult thing for him to do. He is so desperate to win government that he said it. It was like his attempted reversal of his statements on multiculturalism and ethnic affairs. Never mind, we will discuss that at another time.

Remember when Malcolm Fraser went to the people in 1975. He said, `We will retain Medibank.' Within months of getting into office, Medibank was out the window—the universal health system was out the window. We had to bring it back in 1983 in a new form, to sustain the health system.

         Let us turn to the comments of the honourable member for Curtin, who is in the chair at the moment. He raised the question about the limit to the levy and said that it would be logical for the government to go on increasing the levy until it covered the whole cost of health services. With respect, those comments are based on a misunderstanding. At no time has the government ever stated that the intention of the Medicare levy was to cover all the health costs. From the beginning we recognised that the Medicare levy was only a contribution towards health costs. It continues to be so. Therefore, the levy is only making part of that contribution towards the fundamental cost. Unlike the opposition, we understand that additional measures are required in order to raise sufficient funds for health and human services—fundamental issues in social justice, health and human services.

         As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition does not seem to understand what the social wage is about. Health and human services are the fundamental elements of the social wage. It is very interesting that in a 20-minute speech attacking the Prime Minister yesterday the Leader of the Opposition mentioned the words `social wage' a number of times, but he did not explain a single thing about it—not what it means and what it is all about. He was very happy to use the word `battlers'. When it comes to serious policy and to discussing the issues of social justice and the social wage—the human services component of the social wage and the health component of the social wage—what does the Leader of the Opposition do? He does not have a clue. He did not talk about it. He left it to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), to try to say something about it. For 15 or 20 minutes the Leader of the Opposition attacked the Prime Minister personally about this issue, but he did not in any way say what it really means or give his understanding of it. If you go to the record and look for the two words `social justice' under the words `John Howard' you cannot find anything. He never talks about that, unlike the member for Bradfield and several others who have talked about it; unlike the member for Curtin who has talked about some of these issues.

         Let me make these points about this matter: firstly, it is true that the minister underwent a procedure. She did so while she was Premier of Western Australia. It was done in a private hospital, not in a public hospital. She certainly did not push her way through to the top of the queue. She paid for the operation herself. She chose this course of action in order to avoid putting any additional burden on the public health system. This is the position which a number of Australians have taken. For whatever reason, they have chosen not to have private health insurance but to pay the full cost in private hospitals of operations and the like. Whichever member raised this issue—the member for Stirling or another member—it was disgraceful to raise the issue in the context of this debate. The minister acted in a totally honourable fashion. The government is not interested in these personal attacks of the kind that we are getting from the opposition. We are interested in getting on with governing this country. I know you all think that at the first sign of our going up in the polls we will call an election, but that is not the issue at all. Our main concern is to govern this country well.

         —Good governance, as the honourable member says. In the area of human services and health, as in a number of other social areas, we have developed volumes of policy. We have developed a large range of programs, vast networks of administration that are delivering the policies and even in certain cases forcing conservative, reactionary state liberal coalition governments into social policy. In some cases we have had to drag them. A good example of that is the fact that we have had to drag the Kennett government into the child-care system, after 2 1/2 years, and we also tried to drag the Fahey government into the scheme. It took the defeat of that government before New South Wales would become involved in the program. This is the attitude towards social programs which the conservatives have had and will always have.

         In the area of health, we should have been developing a bipartisan approach. Instead, we have had from the shadow minister determination to oppose this measure. I regret that. It is a sorry indication that the conservatives, the New Right in the opposition, are increasingly getting the upper hand. They are not interested in responsible decision making; they simply want to block a number of measures in the budget with the idea of using that as an electoral tool. They will not escape this proposal, because the Australian people in general accept the fact that Medicare is a positive system and that this increase is a small, necessary increase which will assist in the overall operation of the health system—including the new programs which were announced in the budget, especially a program to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and other programs in a range of areas, including programs directed towards people from non-English speaking backgrounds and people with particular problems. All these programs will be very positive and I believe that increasing the Medicare levy by this small amount, while not paying for all these programs, will help to pay for some.

         This legislation is a very responsible measure and should be totally supported by any party which claims that it would have any responsibility in government. I bitterly regret the fact that the opposition is opposing it, and totally reject the argument of those opposite.

         The modifications are necessary following recent disputes where taxpayers have claimed that these goods, which have long been considered taxable at the general rate, should be treated as furniture and, therefore, subject to the concessional rate of 11 per cent. The government considers it necessary to legislate to ensure that these goods continue to be taxed at the general rate. These modifications will prevent the potential for revenue leakage rather than directly increasing revenue.

         —The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Modification (Excise) Bill 1995 and cognate bills, together with the previous bill relating to the increase in the Medicare levy and subsequent bills relating to taxation which the government will deal with in this place this week, are in effect the mechanism by which this government commits electoral fraud on the people of Australia. In this legislation we have an increase in sales tax on two items about which the government had intimated and indicated there would be no such increase; namely, an increase in tax on cars and also an increase in tax on building products.

         As the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) pointed out, we find in these bills an increase in sales tax in a number of areas: an increase in sales tax payable on passenger motor vehicles to the general rate of 21 per cent, up from 16 per cent; a modification of the sales tax law to remove the exemption for a range of building materials which will become taxable now at the rate of 12 per cent; and a series of other tax increases or modifications to make it clear that tax applies to free standing safes, musical instruments, ornaments, model aircraft, scaffolding components, wall and floor safes, racking and shelving systems; and last, but not least, a modification in sales tax law to remove the sales tax exemption for certain 100 per cent recycled paper products.

         I am reminded in this debate of a conversation that I had with my daughter recently. She said to me in her childhood way, `What does it mean when someone says to you, Dad, "A man is as good as his word"?' I said, `Well, it's about being honest. "A man is as good as his word" means he'll keep his word and he'll be honest.' I said by way of example, `If I said to you, "I'll give you $5 extra pocket money if you'll help clean up your room and help clean up around the place," but when it came time to pay it to you the next week I said, "No, you've done all the work but I'm not going to pay it. I'm going to take it back," would that be honest?'

         She said, `No, of course not.' I said, `If I gave you a doll and then I said later, "Listen, I'm taking it back. I gave it to you but it is not really yours to keep. You've had it for a day. I said you could have it but now I am going to take it back," would that be honest?' She said, `No, of course not, Dad.' So I said, `Well, that is what it means when we say, "A man is as good as his word." When something is said in relation to a certain proposal or proposition, it means that that word will be kept.' What we can say in relation to this legislation is that a man is as good as his word—but we see that the word is simply not being kept.

         Let me deal with some of the actual proposals in the legislation; first of all, the increase in sales tax on cars. Let us go back to the famous One Nation statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 26 February 1992. In the ministerial statement that the Prime Minister stood at this dispatch box here and delivered to this place and to the people of Australia, he had this to say about motor vehicles:

         With cheaper cars we will drive newer cars, which is good for the environment, good for road safety, and good for one of our most important industries.

       </para>
       <para>
        He said there would be a permanent lowering of sales tax on motor vehicles from 20 to 15 per cent. What does this piece of legislation propose? It proposes that we increase the sales tax on motor vehicles from 16 to 21 per cent. When we ask about the impact of this, we do not have to go any further than what the Prime Minister himself said in February 1992:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . a saving on a new Commodore or Falcon of around $800.
       </para>
       <para>
        So the impact on ordinary purchasers of motor vehicles of this particular measure, if the prices are about the same as they were in 1992, is an increased cost of some $800 on a new Falcon or a new Holden.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This is just part of the increasing cost of transport under this government. We have seen fuel excise rise from some 6c to 34c per litre. A survey by the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria showed that the cost of running a car over the last year has gone up for a private vehicle by some $13 and for a commercial vehicle by some $48. This is a measure which will have an immediate impact once it is introduced—if it is not defeated elsewhere—on ordinary purchasers of cars. My local dealer in Holden Commodores in Doncaster has already said that he has detected a marked shift in the attitude of buyers in relation to this particular measure.

         In a country that has an aged vehicle fleet—a country whose vehicle fleet is much older than those in most of the developed world—this measure will make it more difficult for people to buy cars. What about the environmental concerns? If we have already got an ageing fleet and this proposal makes it more difficult to buy cars, then we can expect that fewer people will buy cars, which will add to the environmental problem.

         In answer to a question about this in parliament in the last week, the Prime Minister said that no-one in the motor industry should be surprised by this. No-one would be surprised because it is a complete reversal of a policy from the Prime Minister, and that is what everyone—those in the motor industry and elsewhere—has come to expect; that when he says one thing he will actually turn around and do another. The word `permanent' has no realistic meaning at all in the language of the Prime Minister of this country. The word `permanent' becomes meaningless; it becomes a word that means temporary. The moral of this story, if we go back to taking a man at his word, is that the word of the Prime Minister of Australia that something is permanent means that it is temporary. So much for the word of the Prime Minister.

Prior to the 1993 election we were told over and over again in this place and on every media outlet, on radio and television stations around the nation, that we did not need an increase in sales tax. The Prime Minister and members of the government campaigned the length and breadth of this nation saying, `We don't need increases in sales tax and in particular we don't need a goods and services tax.'

The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) remembers them very well. The whole purport of those advertisements was, `We're not going to have a GST.

         The final measure in this bill relates to the change in the tax status of recycled paper. The exemption which currently exists for certain 100 per cent recycled paper products came into operation in October 1989. The aim of the exemption was to encourage the recycling of paper. In June 1992 the federal government accepted that the exemption had had unforeseen consequences and should be narrowed to address problems that had arisen and to direct better the measure to environmental concerns. Accordingly, at that stage, the exemption was removed for facial and toilet tissue; certain books of paper, such as exercise books; and paper bags. The government provided some transitional assistance to a number of small tissue manufacturers who claimed they had made investments based on the introduction of the tax exemption.

         —I thank you for your guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am always much better behaved than the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) and I will try to adhere to your very high standards through the course of my speech on the sales tax bills. The previous speaker tried to convince the House that this is an important measure for the opposition. There he was puffing himself up—a little man trying to sound big and trying to say that this is an important taxation measure for the opposition.

         He is exposed by his own presence in the chamber. The measure is obviously not considered important enough for the opposition to send its shadow Treasurer, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), to make a speech in the second reading debate. It is not important enough for the opposition to send its finance spokesperson, the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), to make a speech in the second reading debate. The opposition sent a junior backbencher to do no more than read out nursery rhymes about Alice in Wonderland and Humpty Dumpty.

It is a trivial issue for the opposition which it is trying to make sound big in an attempt to scare people and score a few points in the lead-up to a federal election.

         Nobody listening to this debate or considering this matter should think that for the opposition it is any more than a chance at election populism. This tells a sad tale of where the opposition has come from and where it is going. In respect of taxation matters, it started out just a few years ago as economic rationalists with a big book based on a 15 per cent GST. Those opposite are policy fundamentalists because the book was the wrong book and it had in it the wrong policy and the wrong approach to taxation. So being policy fundamentalists they have gone to the opposite extreme—that is, no book, no policy and nothing but cheap attempts to try to scare people and score political points.

         That was reflected in the comments of the member for Menzies. He was out there a few years ago selling the virtues of the 15 per cent GST.

The GST would have been imposed on the vanity cabinet, the roof, the floor, the walls and every other part of the building.

         Those opposite should be denounced in this House for such a shameful transformation. There is nothing wrong with a bit of economic rationalism and a bit of spine when it comes to a savings strategy or a rational taxation regime, but it does not have to include a 15 per cent regressive GST. That is where those opposite went wrong—they had the wrong policy approach. They do not know how to put rational economic and taxation policies in place but this government does. That is strongly reflected in these sales tax measures currently before the House.

         The measures also relate—and this is why I am supporting the legislation—to the government's sophisticated savings strategy. The truth is that you should not be in public life and in parliament in 1995 unless you have got a savings strategy in your pocket. If you have not got a savings strategy to counter the current account deficit and to deal with Australia's external problems you should not be in public life or in parliament and, in the case of the opposition, you should not be arguing your credentials for the next election.

         The truth is that economic policy in 1995 rests on the fundamental issue of addressing the current account deficit—the underlying rate of 4.5 per cent of GDP. When cyclical variations affect the underlying rate of the current account deficit as they did in 1982, 1986, 1990 and 1995 and when the proportion of GDP approaches six per cent, for sensible reasons, growth has slowed. There are only two answers to that constraint on Australia's long-term economic growth. The first is to make the economy more competitive. The government is doing that through the national competition policy reforms. The Industry Commission has estimated that those reforms will lower the current account deficit by two per cent as a proportion of GDP and that is very significant. The second point is—and this where I am relevant to the legislation—that we have to have a savings strategy.

         —The member who raised the point of order was not in the chamber when we heard the nursery rhymes about Alice in Wonderland and Humpty Dumpty. In terms of economic policy for 1995 both sides of the House need to have a savings strategy. It is only possible to have credible economic policies if there is a savings strategy in place to address the current account deficit. This legislation is a very important part of the government's savings strategy that is designed to bring the federal budget into surplus. These sales tax measures will add to public savings. That is important because the current account deficit is a reflection of Australia funding investment by using the savings of other nations.

         We can only close the gap between national savings and national investment by lifting the savings stock in Australia. We always hear from the opposition that public savings are very important to achieve that. Moving the federal budget from a deficit in 1994-95 to a healthy surplus in 1995-96 is the biggest contribution to public savings that has been seen in the fiscal policy area for a long while. You have to go back to the mid-1980s to see such an important contribution to public savings.

         This is a genuine nation building task to allow the Australian economy to break free of any growth restraint on the external account. It can only happen by increasing national savings which by definition means lowing the share of consumption. There is one thing that should be tattooed onto the foreheads of those opposite—this would allow the press gallery to read it every day when those opposite go to their press conferences—and that is that GDP is equal to national savings plus national consumption. Any party that comes into this place with a savings strategy needs to be aware that improved savings as a proportion of GDP mean a lower share for consumption.

         That is an undeniable and unavoidable economic rule. It demonstrates the point that in terms of a credible savings strategy there is no quick fix and there is no magic pudding. Savings can only be achieved as a proportion of GDP at the expense of consumption. These sales tax measures before the House are a very important improvement in public savings that also acknowledge a decline in private rates of consumption. They add significantly to Australia's economic strategy. Part of the government's savings strategy on the one hand is to move into a structural surplus in the budget after this, having had this budget in technical surplus, and on the other hand to introduce a superannuation savings strategy that the opposition could only dream about when it was last in government.

         The first measure of the legislation is to increase the sales tax payable on passenger motor vehicles to the general rate of 21 per cent—that is, to move it from 16.5 per cent back to 21 per cent where it was prior to One Nation. This acknowledges another economic truth that the opposition should accept—that is, the One Nation statement was designed for counter-cyclical reasons. It was designed to lift Australia out of a period of low consumption and low aggregate demand and get the economy growing again, which it did so magnificently. Having achieved the counter-cyclical purpose of One Nation, and with the economy now growing so strongly, it is perfectly legitimate for this government to change policy three years after One Nation and bring the passenger motor vehicles back to the general sales tax rate.

         How has the car industry changed in those three years? Three years ago, at the time of One Nation, the car industry was suffering from a lack of consumption, a lack of aggregate demand, in the Australian economy. But now, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) pointed out last week in question time, we have waiting times of six months for some Australian cars. If you decide to purchase an Australian produced car in 1995, there is up to a six-month wait for some models to be delivered. That is how strong the demand and the consumption have become in 1995.

         If aggregate demand and consumption are running away too strongly, if they are spilling over into problems on the external account, the nation needs to address its lack of savings. It can do so by re-establishing the sales tax rate for passenger motor vehicles.

         So too is the application of sales tax to a number of building materials sensible. The revenue gain estimated in 1995-96 is $215 million. At various times, both sides of the House have conceded that an important goal for the national savings strategy is to narrow the distortions in the taxation treatment of alternative forms of saving. It is a very simple proposition. This was reflected most clearly in the FitzGerald report on national savings which was at the time heralded by the then shadow Treasurer, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), as a landmark report, something the government should act on.

Still it is moving in the right direction. What is so outstanding about the government's saving strategy is that it is moving in the right direction. A willingness to increase national savings, particularly public savings, and just take the top off private consumption at the very peak of the economic cycle is good economic policy. It is outstanding economic policy.

The Australian people understand that. Over the 12 years of the internationalisation of the Australian economy, Australians have become more sophisticated in understanding the economic debate. They are looking out for the carpetbaggers, the election populists and the opportunists and they will finger them at the first available opportunity. They will finger them at the next election for who they are and what they represent. In the sophisticated debates that our trading nation should have, they understand that national savings policy is a key test of leadership.

Labor needs to get serious about fiscal policy and trim the fat off public expenditure. The budget actually increases government spending—less asset sales—by $6.6 billion, or 1.7 per cent in real terms. Although the stated budget surplus is $718 million, the reality is that there is an underlying structural deficit—a real deficit—of just over $8 billion.

         These bills are a continuation of Labor's drive to introduce a consumption tax by surreptitious means. As I mentioned earlier, the amount of indirect sales tax collected by the government will increase by 22.3 per cent this year. It is also interesting to look at Labor's record since 1982-83. Over Labor's long 12 years in office, it has increased sales tax revenue by a whopping 305.7 per cent.

They are screws, nails, paint, putty, adhesives, wallpaper, ceramic and glass floor and wall tiles, taps, nozzles, handles and joinery, such as prefabricated cupboards and office partitioning. This increased application of sales tax will increase the price of an average new home by an estimated $1,000 to $2,000.

         When sales tax was first introduced by the Scullin Labor government on 1 August 1930, it was levied at the rate of 2.5 per cent, it was broad based and it was designed to be imposed at the wholesale level. Few goods were then exempt, but the following were: goods exported; goods sold by a dispensing chemist; medicine sold by a friendly society; retail goods sold by a manufacturer that were made to meet an individual customer order; small manufactures; primary products; and a limited list of other exempt goods. Within 12 months the rate was increased to six per cent. It was only during the Second World War that differentiated rates of sales tax were introduced.

Business is affected by the compliance costs of meeting all obligations under the law, and sales tax continues to be built into the cost of business inputs.

         The other point I raise, which negatively impacts on business, is that sales tax continues to be built into the cost of business inputs. This is because in many cases wholesale sales tax is not paid directly but indirectly through the higher prices charged by suppliers who themselves must pay sales tax. The available system of exemptions has done little to reduce the amount of sales tax cascading throughout the production process of too many firms throughout our economy.

The reality is that this government merely ignores the problems in the sales tax system. It ignores the distortion of production and consumption decisions that come about because some goods are hit by sales tax while other goods are not. It ignores the further distortions that result from having a multiple indirect tax rate structure which includes very high rates of tax on some goods.

         The new measures fail to address the vast array of anomalies that have emerged under the wholesale sales tax, both in the sales tax treatment of certain goods and in the range of exemptions made available to some users of these goods but not to others. There is no recognition of the cascading effect of sales tax, and other indirect taxes for that matter, through the production process. Sales tax will continue to fall heavily on intermediate business inputs, investment goods and exports in addition to the burden placed on consumers. The wholesales sales tax system thus serves to undermine the productive and export potential of Australian businesses.

         Anomalies in the sales tax system are widespread and, without doubt, beyond resolution by this government. Wedding rings are exempt from sales tax, yet engagement rings are taxed at 31 per cent. Cordial is taxed at 11 per cent, but soft drinks are taxed at 21 per cent. Some household wares are taxed at 11 per cent, but cleaning and other products are taxed at 21 per cent. Biscuits and snack products are taxed—they are also relatively more often consumed by lower income people—yet caviar, crayfish, expensive meats and exotic fruits, which are more likely to be purchased by higher income groups, are not taxed. On a slightly different tack, why should a sign painted on a wall not be subject to sales tax while a sign painted on a board and then attached to the wall is?

This method would even fix the issue of tax payable on the sign that I mentioned earlier. However, the people of Australia rejected that at the last poll. It is off the agenda, and it will not return.

         I will expand on their circumstance. As I mentioned earlier, many placed orders especially with Ford dealers to purchase Ford cars as far back as December 1994 and February 1995. Some of those people were Ford employees who, because they receive some concessions on purchases of company vehicles, are continually rescheduled to the bottom of the dealer's customer list when the general demand is strong and vehicles are in short supply.

These factors, coupled with the public holidays that occurred in April, simply meant that the company did not get any more than 10 production days, which set its production schedules back enormously and has led to this pent-up demand in the marketplace. These factors exacerbated Ford's supply problem and, coupled with the strong demand for its vehicles, has brought about a vehicle delivery situation which has stretched to months.

Even the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did not vote on this stupid division. Nor did the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe). The other division was on a motion to grant the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) an extension of time. Again, neither the Prime Minister nor the Deputy Prime Minister voted.

It stands for the creation of more jobs, jobs with careers, jobs with decent pay and fair working conditions. As a community, we have to be vigilant to defend these goals and the values underlying them—the values of a cohesive, safe and caring community.

         These reforms were opposed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), who was incapable of dropping his hard line on industrial relations. While generally the opposition is a policy free zone, it has not dumped the thrust of Jobsback, its 1993 wage and industrial relations policy. In 14 years the opposition leader has supported only two wage increases—two $8 safety net increases in 14 years; only $1.10 per week for every year of 14 years. That is the record of the opposition on wages and working conditions for average Australian families.

         Despite the general arrogance of the opposition in refusing to stand for anything, it has not changed its industrial policy. This, too, in spite of the lessons in Victoria, where Mr Kennett has been giving Jobsback a dry run for three years now. And if Australian workers need reminding of what that means, they should just look at the Victorian government's recent actions. It is advocating a minimum wage of $8.60, which represents a cut of $60 per week or, roughly, $3,000 per year for minimum wage recipients.

         The effect of the industrial relations strategies of the opposition could not be clearer to Australian workers: because it has only committed itself to minimum protection for workers, entitlements such as penalty rates, leave loading, shift allowance and family leave would be abolished under the coalition. Its spokesman, the member for Flinders, Mr Reith, is committed to abolishing the no disadvantage test. Workers receiving those entitlements would receive a real wage deduction under the coalition's industrial relations policy.

         Let us consider what that would mean. For a typical unskilled labourer who currently works an average amount of overtime—which is 10 hours—without penalties, the reduction in overtime pay would be $199 per week or $4,888 per year. For a part-time worker on low pay—say, a nurse who works 16 hours each weekend—under the current arrangements his or her pay would be $299 a week but without penalties it is reduced to $184 a week. This amounts to a loss of $5,970 a year or, put another way, a 38 per cent wage reduction.

         The opposition will say that under its system you can opt to stay under the award but there will be no updating of the award over time and all new entrants to the work force will be assured of only four basic minimum conditions. The objective is to reduce real wages for ordinary workers. The net result of the policy of the Leader of the Opposition is an erosion of the working conditions and the safety net for all Australian workers. This has been demonstrated by the Kennett and other conservative state governments.

         Since 1993 the size of the federal industrial relations system has increased by 400,000 workers. This has been due entirely to the neanderthal industrial policies of the conservative state governments, such as the one in Victoria. Since 1993, federally, we have seen the introduction, through the Industrial Relations Reform Act, of national minimum entitlements based on ILO conventions. These have all been opposed by the opposition. These entitlements guarantee all workers the right to a fair minimum wage, 12 months unpaid parental leave, equal pay for work of equal value and protection against unfair dismissal. All of these ILO mandated standards are in the firing line under Jobsback.

         —In this debate on the adjournment I want to point out to the House the extraordinary performance we saw from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) in the Main Committee. In one of the most irresponsible and misleading contributions I have ever heard, in just five minutes he made at least four grossly misleading statements. The first was in relation to road funding, when he said:

       <para>
        Those are the words he used. But, if you look at page 3-202 of Budget Paper No. 1 at the identified road grants to the states, you will find that they were $369.2 million and that identified local road grants on page 3-205 were $358.1 million. That is a total of $727 million, not the $2 billion that the parliamentary secretary bandied around. As someone who supposedly knows what goes on in the portfolio, I would have thought he would have a few ideas. Seven hundred million dollars is very different from $2 billion.

         He then talked about the amount of money that states spend on the roads as if it all came from the Commonwealth. What about all the money the motorists pay to the states in taxes? There are fuel franchise fees, registration charges, licensing fees, tolls in some cases, fines and stamp duty. All of this money is raised by the state government; it does not come from the Commonwealth. It seems he could not understand the difference and got quite confused as he continued his speech. It is a great worry to think that the parliamentary secretary for transport really does not understand this.

       <para>
        That was just one report. Next, Dr Quiggin, someone the Labor Party likes to quote, in 1993 estimated that a `lower bound' solution of accident costs imposed by motorists on non-motorists was $1.2 billion per year—even less. Meyrick Associates in a 1994 report said:

         Clearly, this man is rather confused. In the five minutes he made at least four major misleading statements—I cannot get to the fourth one in the time available to me.

         —This evening I would like to make some remarks concerning the budget and its implications for North Queensland. North Queensland is the great juggernaut of the Australian economy, producing some $12,000 million a year in export earnings. Whilst I have not had time to pin all the figures down exactly, Mount Isa Mines produces some $1,200 million to $1,300 million a year in export earnings; the coal industry, about $4,000 million; the tourism industry, about $2,000 million; the aluminium industry, about $1,000 million; the sugar industry, about $2,000 million; and the cattle and sheep industries, about $2,000 million. These add up to some $12,000 million per year in export earnings.

         When the Australian dollar was allowed to float in 1986, the dollar floated down to 59c. At that time Australia owed only some $70,000-odd million. Today Australia owes—as we know from the figures that were released recently—$170,000 million. Since the dollar floated down to 59c in 1986, presumably today it would float down to less than 59c if it were allowed to free float, if there were not intervention buying by the Reserve Bank and if there were not artificial interest rates.

People on the other side have obviously very satisfactorily read and digested that. They have actually got people believing that interest rates of 10 per cent for business are really excellent. Those interest rates of 10 per cent for business exist at a time when our trading partners in the United States have interest rates of 6 1/2 per cent and our trading partners in Japan have interest rates of 3 1/2 per cent.

         Let me move on. The way to accomplish that is to bring interest rates down to the same levels as our trading partners in the United States and Japan. The rate in Japan the last time I looked was 3.5 per cent, and six per cent in the United States. This would mean interest rates in this country of about four or five per cent. That would bring the dollar down to where it should be. The theft literally of thousands of millions of dollars which the people of North Queensland are entitled to would then be returned to those people, who at the present moment are reeling on the ropes. Not only have they got the theft of the Australian dollar being placed up where it is but also they have the thieving out of their pockets through interest rates—and I am not even including the tax of the federal government.

         Couple that with the aggressive marketing policies in the areas of petrol and wool. The minimum price scheme which enabled us to get a decent price for our product was abolished by the socialists who are in government in Australia at the present moment. As a result, instead of this country receiving $6,000 million a year in export earnings from wool, we receive only a little over $2,500 million a year. That is an average loss to this country of $3,500 million per year.

         In the period of oil deregulation, and I am talking here about Hilmer—the only other area of the economy that was deregulated was banking, which was an absolute disaster—the price of oil worldwide dropped clean in half. The Brent price was around $34 a barrel; it is now down to $17 a barrel—in fact, one quote was $14 a barrel. At the same time the price of petrol in Australia doubled.

In particular, I wish to refer to the speech that he made to the Main Committee on the appropriation bill in which he outrageously attacked in an unsubstantiated fashion a number of people, including Mr Michael Costello and Mr Mark Leibler. The honourable member for Deakin has a long history of making paranoid conspiracy theories and accusations in this place and elsewhere without any substantiation. I will just give some examples. In 1983 he suggested that the then Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, was connected with the mafia. Subsequently he said that Kokums, the Swedish shipping firm, was run by Soviet spies. Then he said that the former judge of the High Court, Lionel Murphy, had been engaged in meetings with Abe Saffron.

More recently he has made other attacks on Mr Mark Leibler which were described by members of his own party, such as the former member for MacKellar, as `disgraceful' and even by the current honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) as `a matter of regret'. Most recently he has attacked the Smorgon family as being linked with organised crime.

         There is one common thread in all of these accusations—that is, that there has been no substantiation and no follow-up. To the best of my knowledge, nobody has been convicted of any crimes or even charged with respect to any of the allegations made. It is no wonder that the honourable member for Deakin has in his career been rejected by the voters in Henty, rejected by his own preselectors in Bruce, rejected again by his own preselectors in Deakin and then most recently rejected by preselectors in Queensland.

We are not told where he got this letter purporting to relate to a transfer of $640,000 of drug money to Mr Michael Costello. There is no evidence of authenticity of the letter. In effect, there is just a complete outrageous unsubstantiated smear of a senior public servant who obviously cannot reply in this forum. By implication, he accuses Mr Costello of rendering services to a foreign government or intelligence service for drug money. Some of his evidence to indicate the authenticity of this accusation includes the following: that Mr Costello was the architect of the Cambodian peace plan and he actually did not have much of a background in Asia. What that has to do with the accusation is beyond me.

         The honourable member for Deakin also refers to allegations of `many long lunches, dinners and animated conversations' with a Soviet employee, Valery Zemskov, who is alleged to be a KGB agent.

How do we know that he is suspected? What is the basis of this accusation? Surely it is logical that if a leak was being investigated the Federal Police would actually talk to the head of the department about it. If you actually look at some of the specifics, he describes Mr Costello as a monument to mafia mateship. Again, a smear has been thrown around with gay abandon and with no supporting evidence. He indicates that at the time this alleged letter was written, Mr Costello was overseas. So what? He also points out that Mr Costello has been to Brazil and Chile, which happened to be in the same continent as the country that this letter is alleged to have come from. What an incredible, ridiculous load of nonsense!

         Obviously, tourism remains very important to the Australian economy. I am sure many members will have read the recent report by the Tourism Forecasting Council. It is an excellent document and paints a glowing picture of Australia's tourism industry, not only of the consistent growth that has occurred over the last 15 years but also, more importantly, of the very healthy looking forecasts for the industry between now and the year 2000. It says that in the year 2000 6.3 million people are expected to visit Australia, that is more than double the number that visited in 1993, and for the next 10 years inbound tourism is expected to grow by 10 per cent a year.

         Tourism is well known for its contribution to export earnings of around $10.6 billion per annum. It is a very important industry to Australia. I suspect that the government has done very little to assist the tourism industry. The tourism industry is one of those Australian industries which has grown despite the government. It is a great tribute to the many small business people in every part of the tourism industry who have made the industry what it is. Many of those people are my constituents, so I see at first hand exactly what they are doing on a day-to-day basis.

         There are lots of reasons why we should not be complacent about our tourism industry. When the vice-president of All Nippon Airways visited Australia last week, he made some very pertinent remarks. He informed us—it was news to a lot of people—that Japanese tourists find visiting Australia expensive compared with going to the west coast of the United States.

         Honourable members might think, with the way the $A has depreciated against the yen in recent times, that we would find it very expensive to go to Japan, but the point is that we are almost paying the Japanese to come here. If Australia is an expensive destination for the Japanese, of all people, then it probably ought to ring warning bells for the government to ask why. I hope that the comments made by that visiting Japanese airline executive will be taken very seriously and that we might look at that. I suspect the fact that we have an archaic industrial relations system is probably a major factor in contributing to that lack of competitiveness. We need to be very careful. As was pointed out, the industry is volatile for all sorts of reasons and we should not be complacent about the fact that the Japanese will continue to support Australia to the extent that they do.

         It was interesting that the vice-president of All Nippon Airways also talked about the need for Australia to revise its visa system. That is something the government ought to consider. I know it comes up from time to time and perhaps, with VJ day approaching, it may not be entirely appropriate to put it firmly on the agenda at this particular time. Our visa system is, once again, becoming out of date and out of step with a lot of other countries. Few Asians are overstayers and the Japanese do not overstay in any great number.

         There is evidence that when other countries have revised their visa system it has led to an increase in tourism.

Revising the visa restrictions which currently apply would be one way of doing that.

None of the recommendations surfaced in the budget, but I am prepared to concede that that was because the report came down shortly before the budget. Our visiting Japanese airline executive called for incentives to be put in place. As a result of that call, it becomes clear that incentives are needed. EMDG is one, but there are numerous others recommended here. Rather than incentives for the tourism industry, what we have in the budget are a number of disincentives, that is, an increase in company tax, increases in tax on building materials, an increase in sales tax on motor cars and all sorts of things which are going to make it more expensive for tourism operators.

         —The member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) focused on tourism. It is worth noting that, when compared with 1983, tourism in 1995 is a massive contributor to the Australian national economy. Whereas it was not even an industry that was fully recognised by the federal government in 1983, when the Liberals were last in power, today tourism represents an $11.2 billion earner to Australia in terms of foreign exchange.

         There has been a massive increase in the number of tourists who come here, and the growth is continuing. They are coming not only from Japan but from the whole north Asia region. From Korea, from Taiwan and even from China, the number of visitors coming here has been growing at seven, eight and 10 per cent over the last couple of years; and that is because we have had a concerted strategy of marketing into Japan and into north Asia as well.

         With the appropriations that are allocated in this year's budget, the Australian Tourism Commission will be able to continue with that job. It is developing the increasing sophistication demanded by the market. People packaging holidays in Japan tell us that these days the Japanese tourist is looking for more than the tightly targeted package that would have been sold and was accepted in their tours in the past. Now, tourists from Japan are looking for a broader range of experiences. They are wanting to get outside the Cairns area. They are wanting to get to the outback areas. There are a lot more rural holidays taken by Asian tourists, as well as by other tourists coming to Australia. The whole strategy that the Tourism Commission has been adopting has been focused on trying to broaden out the tourism product that visitors coming to Australia can enjoy.

         A couple of weeks ago we had the launch of the regional tourism program. Again, that was an initiative of the government which we made a commitment about before the last election and which is being implemented. It is ensuring a building of tourism infrastructure all across Australia. It does not matter whether we go to Queensland or to places like Strahan, on the west coast of Tasmania: the Commonwealth government is there, helping to build the infrastructure that is needed to provide the tourism potential of that region.

We know from the research that the Tourism Commission has done in Japan that that is striking a very positive chord with the Japanese tourists that want to come to Australia.

         Mention was made of industrial relations, and the impediment that that might or might not be to the tourism industry. I note that before the budget the big cry of the opposition was that there was going to be a bed tax. That was the big scare that was being run prior to the budget. Of course, that did not eventuate. That was another thing the opposition had on the wish list of things it hoped might be in the budget, but it was not. By its continuing commitment to the Tourism Commission and to the Department of Tourism in the budget allocations, the government has showed that it is maintaining very strongly the Tourism Commission's drive in its international marketing strategy.

         In order to assess the values of any department, it is necessary to look around and to meet some of the people, and to look through the accounts presented in the budget. To have only five minutes for this side of the House to discuss these estimates is a deplorable state of affairs. But the government is in a rush to judgment. It wishes to hurry to the election and to get rid of the budget—it does not matter what is in it. The hallmark of this government is that the people of Australia must not be told too much.

         The budget itself, as addressed to industry and commerce, is about business, but as far as business is concerned there is nothing in it but a let-down. Business sought a reduction  in the deficit. This can be done in two ways: by cutting spending or increasing taxes. To cut spending was what businesses were calling for. The government took the soft option: it is an election year, therefore up with taxation. Consequently, investment will fall, growth will fall, and a  fall in employment will follow. On top of that, there will be a negative impact on savings. The cumulative effect is that our international competitive position will not be enhanced by the actions of this government. Indeed, the speech by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) stated that it is a tough environment in which industry is operating.

We are heading towards the Bogor agreement and therefore all those areas of assistance will be gone. I can assure the government that the opposition does not see it that way.

The Burgess committee was set up to review the programs of assistance. However, the riding instructions given to Mr Burgess were not to look at alternative programs, but to look at the programs we have and see how we might be able to improve them. As a consequence, very little, in my view, came out of the Burgess committee report at all.

Is that the way you spend money? Does that get productivity up? Does that get business going? It certainly does not. It is all the gloss. But the final gloss is this: the million-dollar man. There is $10 million in the budget to promote new industry. And who is doing it? None other than John Dawkins. I hope he enjoys it while he has got it.

         We have seen the programs and policies of this portfolio developed in a way which has delivered manufacturing growth in this country at unprecedented levels. For example, Australia's manufacturing sector has recorded growth over the last two to three years in a way which has been unmatched in our history. It has been responsible for nearly a quarter of the total growth of the Australian economy since early 1991, even though it only accounts for 16 per cent of the total economy. Production in the manufacturing sector rose by 9.3 per cent in real terms in 1993-94, compared to overall economic growth of 4.2 per cent. It is an outstanding achievement.

         The growth in exports of our elaborately transformed manufactures—ETMs—has been particularly impressive over the last decade. Australia exported $2.4 billion of ETMs in 1984. In 1994, this figure was $11.5 billion. That is a growth of 16 per cent a year over the decade. Again, a truly outstanding milestone achievement. So the growth in manufacturing and export service industries demonstrates the success of these policies. That success contrasts sharply with the failure of the opposition's industry policies when it was in government. This is a very important point to make in this debate.

         The appropriations for the industry, science and technology portfolio are $2.8 billion, approximately the same as in 1994-95. In my speech on the appropriation bills, I covered a number of agencies and programs being administered by the portfolio this year and I will not add to those remarks today. But the government has set out in the budget a new phase of our support for one particular program which I want to make a few remarks on, and that is the textile, clothing and footwear industries program. This new TCF development package will continue the process of restructuring, it will help raise productivity to meet the industry's goal of $2 billion of exports by the year 2000. And, importantly, the package will assist the industries to meet the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities that will emerge from Australia's integration within APEC.

         I want to refer to the welfare aspects of primary industry in the time that is available, and I notice that in the budget statement welfare for the rural sector is now DPIE included in its expenditure. I think in particular of the DRP, the drought relief payment, and I think also of some of the other elements that are now included in primary industry to bolster the figures which should not be there and traditionally have not been there, for example, the diesel rebate, which really is income forgone rather than a payment, and also even labour market programs, which should be under another department and not in primary industry.

         It does indicate the double standard of this government with regard to rural welfare versus urban welfare. At a time when welfare generally is increasing in urban Australia—and I can understand that because of the high level of unemployment—it has actually been reduced in rural Australia. I think in particular of the restrictions on household support, which is now only available in declared exceptional circumstance areas, and you know how difficult that has been in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, with the drought. I think also of the inappropriate use of assets tests, which has meant that most rural people basically miss out on any of the welfare provisions available to other Australians. I think of the assets test in relation to Austudy and what that means for denial of educational opportunities.

         When one talks about two Australias, rich and poor, that is certainly the case, but I believe most of the commentators have missed out on who are the rich and who are the poor. The biggest income divide in this country is not in the city; it is between country and city. The best evidence of that is the Parliamentary Research Service comparison of the 1990-91 census of 147 federal electorates with 57 different comparisons—you can call it the Heinz study, if you like. The number of rural or regional classified electorates would be, at the most, say, one-third of the total of 147, but the comparison indicates that the 12 poorest, those electorates with family incomes below $16,000, are all in rural Australia. Murray is number 30 and there are only eight of the first 30 that are urban electorates. So we can see the tremendous disproportion in income between country and city. Since the census in 1990-91, that would have got worse because of the drought and because of low wool prices.

         The budget makes it clear that the government is determined to provide the ongoing assistance that large parts of rural Australia need because of the severity of the drought and the ongoing nature of that drought. I would like to go to a couple of the details. The drought assistance measures introduced to date total $302 million, from 1994 up to the period 1997-98. Given the adjustments made to the rural adjustment scheme to ensure that the exceptional circumstances provisions were demand driven, the cost of the package is estimated to increase to $519 million. To have any suggestion that it is not, indeed, a very substantial financial commitment, as well as a very strong recognition of the severity of the particular needs of rural Australia, is to sell this budget and the government's actions well and truly short.

         The drought relief payment has already benefited some 10,000 farm families. I do not think anyone would dispute either the need or the severity of the problem. But I would also be arguing, very strongly, that that highlights the substantial nature of the response. The total assistance that those 10,000 farm families have received to date is just on $48 million.

I think most of us who live in the cities these days are very conscious not only of the impact of the drought on farm families but of what that does to communities in the country towns that service those farms as well.

That is important. Everyone knows that the demands in rural Australia are substantial and will continue to be substantial. The budget estimates themselves take account of the fact that the ongoing severity of the drought is going to have a continuing impact, particularly on export markets and on the trade position. We all hope that will be overcome sooner than later but, as the member for Murray points out, it is a substantial issue.

It is not quite good enough to say that, as the Asian economies move on and further mature and develop from their very small economic bases, they are going to show huge growth figures; their needs are going to be different, and that explains justifiably, in the eyes of some, why it is okay for Australia to lose market share in some of these key Asian economic tigers.

In the context of the allocation of these appropriations for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I want to see attention brought to bear on that circumstance, on the need to further diversify our export efforts, and on the need to, in fact, lift our game against some pretty nasty competition coming from around the Pacific and elsewhere in the world.

There is a need to be very careful about Australian taxpayer dollars being used on aid. There is, of course, a case for foreign aid: it does indeed help Australia and does help many people in the world who are disadvantaged, and I am, in general terms, supportive of the foreign aid program.

We must work harder to drive those foreign aid dollars just as far as they can be driven to produce the maximum effective outcome.

         One of the significant things about the reopening of the embassy in Beirut—which is something that all of us have been keen to encourage just as soon as the security situation permitted, and something the government has been committed to have occur this year—is that, as well as reopening the embassy, we are going to establish an Austrade office in the embassy in Beirut. That is a reflection of the fact that we do appreciate the opportunity to use the embassy in Beirut as a major gateway to build trade not only with Lebanon, but also with the region.

         One of things that has become clear in more recent times is that, as Lebanon goes through the process of restructuring after the devastation of the war that has occurred there, the opportunities to both invest in Lebanon and use that investment to extend more broadly into the region are very real indeed. Last Sunday, the Australian Lebanese Business Council had the launch of a trade mission it is taking to Lebanon to coincide with the reopening of the embassy. Again, that reflects the fact that Australian business people here—particularly those originally from the Lebanon who have come here and shown terrific enterprise in business—recognise that business here can play a very active part in that rebuilding process in Lebanon, with the range of demands and needs it has to rebuild infrastructure and the whole range of services from financial services through to water, electricity, et cetera.

         At the launch of the Australian Lebanese trade mission last Sunday, business people were saying that the opportunities in Lebanon are as great as those in Vietnam, if we move in there early and play a real part, because of the strong connections Australia has with Lebanon and the great bilateral relationship that there is between the two peoples of the respective countries. We know that the demands that exist there are shared by countries right around that region, and that Australia is well regarded throughout the Middle East. I certainly share the view that, through our trade efforts, we can do substantially more to boost trade in the Middle East across a range of agricultural areas; but I do not limit the potential to agriculture alone: there is a whole range of service areas that are also potential opportunities for Australian business.

         The member for Farrer referred to a couple of other matters, including the area of foreign aid. It is correct to say that there is a marginal decline, as a percentage of GDP, in the foreign aid budget for this year—I think the actual figures are 0.34 to 0.33—but the dollar increase over this year, and the previous budget, highlights the government's ongoing commitment to the foreign aid program. That real dollar commitment has indeed been a substantial increase over those two years. That of course enables a well targeted, properly focused foreign aid program to be achieved. It also enables the government to maintain its clear commitment to the range of foreign aid needs that exist, be they in the immediate region or in Africa and other parts.

         In the area of trade with Asia, the fact is that over recent years there has been a massive increase in our commitment and representation within the Asia-Pacific region. We have not only opened additional Austrade offices but we have also had much greater commitment to our direct diplomatic representation in countries in the region. There has been a very strong focus on using that increased representation to further the trade opportunities that exist in the region.

         It is clear, from almost every facet of industry we talk about—whether it relates to Indonesia or other countries in the region—that that commitment is ongoing. Rarely a week goes by without major visits to Australia from business in those countries or delegations from here to countries in the region. Certainly the opportunities are there and we have to grasp them. We know that those countries are going to be competitive and to suggest that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is doing anything other than putting the proper focus on the Asia region, and the growth opportunities in the region, is absolutely wrong. I commend the estimates of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Main Committee.

         —I was a member of the Standing Committee on Procedure which put forward the recommendation for the establishment of the second chamber. Part of the recommendation, and part of the reason for it, was that members of this House would have additional opportunity to speak on issues of importance, not just to them but to the nation as a whole. The whole purpose of this chamber was to extend the range of speakers, and yet we find in this budget debate that we have still had the gag applied and we have still had the guillotine applied. I want to make a formal complaint about that. It is totally inappropriate that this government should try to gag and guillotine discussion on the most important document to come before the parliament every year—that is, the budget. It affects every man, woman and child in this country. It is just further evidence of the authoritarian attitude of the government. We have seen this in the most recent moves to take steps to jail journalists if they do something that the government believes is incorrect.

         I make the point that members of the opposition have been prevented from speaking on the budget because of the gag and because of the guillotine. It is only because we have the second chamber that we got an extra day and a half; otherwise most of the opposition would have been prevented from speaking on the budget. I do not see that as an expression of democracy.

         It is interesting to note that very few government members bothered to say a word on the budget. I can only assume that they are a bit ashamed of it. We have the figure being put forward in the budget of a surplus of $719 million, whereas the real deficit is certainly at least $8.2 billion. Of course, some people who have been analysing the budget suggest that it is as high as over $12 billion.

         One of the ways that the government has falsely attained this so-called surplus is by the sale of assets, one of which is Dasfleet. It is interesting that this particular sale is a double con—while the government has applied to the budget the revenue, the funds that it is getting from the sale of Dasfleet, it is my understanding that it has not counted in that it is going to have to lease back the fleet to continue to provide the same service. So on the one hand it is going to sell it and that is counted in, but then it is going to have to pay to lease it back and I understand that that has not been included.

         —As my colleague says, plenty of them are getting their notice this week. The other thing is that in terms of the budget, in terms of the so-called surplus which is achieved by the sale of assets, the people of Australia should be very much aware that this is a very high taxing government, that over the next two years alone taxation revenue will increase by $6 billion. That is an additional $2.4 billion in 1995-96 and an additional $3.6 billion in 1996-97. This is the biggest single tax hike since the Whitlam government.

         I make the point again that the surplus in the budget is a false surplus. It has been obtained artificially by the sale of assets. If assets were to be sold, the money obtained from them should not be put in just to wipe out a deficit in one year but should be paid off the debt of the Commonwealth. The debt of the people of Australia should have been reduced by the sale of Dasfleet, by the sale of Qantas and by the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, when that occurs.

         With respect to the actual matters relating to Comcar, most of the major announcements relating to the restructuring of Comcar were taken in last year's budget or in earlier management decisions. There are no matters pertinent to this year's budget that directly affect Comcar operations at all. I know from experience, and from what I get told in New South Wales, that the basic numbers of Comcar drivers that were spelt out as required have been reached and there have not been anything other than voluntary redundancies that achieved that number over a period of time with the natural process of people taking those packages.

         Clearly, it is an issue that the minister and the government continue to take seriously. I will certainly relay the general concerns that the member for Cowper raised about that particular area to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker). I make a comment generally on the asset sales question, given that the member for Cowper raised that. As the Treasurer (Mr Willis) indicated in question time last week, in answering a question about the accounting of asset sales and the arrangements that apply to those, the process that we are following in this year's budget is absolutely no different from that which was followed when the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer of Australia, or that undertaken by other governments. Exactly the same accounting process has been followed in relation to asset sales in this year's budget as has been in other budgets.

I thank the member for Brisbane for reminding me of that fact. The fact of the matter is that, as far as Dasfleet is concerned, we are in the same category of treating that asset sale as we are with other asset sales. The appropriate arrangements for what other lease-back arrangements might apply in the future are spelt out—indeed, in the documents that were provided as part of the administrative services advice on budget night.

         The second point I would make is that that does not indicate that in any way the opposition is policy bankrupt in terms of the defence portfolio. Far be it from that. I heard the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch) in this place last week, in the context of a particular debate, make that point. I say to the parliamentary secretary, and I hope he will convey this to the minister, that initiatives will emerge from the coalition, the opposition, at an appropriate time of our making in due course.

That is the sort of percentage that ministers and the parliamentary secretary would use. That is as a result of some arithmetic gymnastics and adjustments within the department that I need not go into in the time available. However, I think that the most important point to make is that that represents 2.0 per cent of GDP. Argue about it or not, Parliamentary Secretary, that is the lowest that this country has experienced in our history—two per cent of GDP. That must, of course, put up signs around the place that we need to consider that and look at that in detail.

         So far as asset sales generally are concerned, as they affect Defence, there have been a number of assets that have been identified for disposal; but it has not been the top of the market, as it were, to sell many of those assets. Defence is keen to ensure that it does get a good return on those assets, and I would anticipate that given the change in the broad economic climate we will see some of those assets to which the member for Groom referred being able to be put on the market and realised during the course of the current financial year. I am not in the position to provide him with specific advice on ASTA and the AIDC, but I would be quite happy to look into that for him.

         In relation to the Nomad aircraft, another issue which I know he has pursued for some time, there is an ongoing investigation. I understand that the findings from that inquiry are due to be presented to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) by the end of June this year. In fact, at a recent function I was talking to one of the officers involved in that review, and was advised that it is still ongoing. I know they have not completed their work at this time. Hopefully that work will be completed in time for a report to be made available to the minister by the end of June, and we will then all be in a position to make some clear assessment about what future role, if any, the Nomad has in the Australian Defence Force.

         —Indeed. I will finally turn to the big picture question of the amount of money defence globally gets out of the budget. As the member for Groom correctly points out, it is a smidgin under $10 billion. That does represent an increase, as a percentage of government outlays. It also represents about two per cent of GDP.

         It is interesting that the percentage of GDP is often used as a yardstick. I have made it very plain, for some time, that I have never regarded percentage of GDP as a dramatically useful measure for defence effectiveness. It may have some use when you are trying to compare across national boundaries. But even there it is very limited, because it is a percentage of a fluctuating figure, and that does not produce too much in terms of actual hardware or personnel on the ground.

         I will just illustrate that. I have just come from a lunch with visiting members of the Japanese parliament. The gentlemen sitting beside me were talking about defence matters. Bear in mind that Japan has what is the third largest defence force in the world—it is, arguably, the second largest, if you take account of what has happened in the Soviet Union. The gentleman sitting beside me said, `How much do you spend on defence? What percentage of GDP?' I said, `Two per cent.' He said, `Oh, that is twice as much as we spend.' There is the answer.

         It is two per cent. It also happens to be maintaining defence commitments in all but real terms. There has been only a very slight reduction in defence outlays in the last year. I should not let the opportunity pass without noting that, on the last occasion, the opposition did have a formal policy on defence. At the last election, the opposition undertook to reduce outlays on defence by $200 million beyond the cuts which we were programming. The two per cent figure is not one I would rest on.

         —The Appropriation Bill (No. 2) appropriates a sum of $4,365 million for the year ending 30 June 1996. The bill primarily deals with payments to the states and capital works and services. Payments to the states authorised by the proposed new act must be made on the terms and conditions that are, from time to time, determined in writing as being the terms and conditions applicable to payments to states under the act. They must be paid in the amounts, and at the times, that are determined in writing by the minister. As in the case of Appropriation Bill (No. 1), there is a provision for this act to be updated, should the Financial Management and Accountability Bill be enacted before 30 June 1995.

         In debating the Appropriation Bill (No.1), I have already canvassed the excessive spending and the excessive use of higher taxes that are a hallmark of this government. I have also dealt with the growth in debt that is also a hallmark of this government, and I do not propose to go over these issues again. However, we will not let this government forget its fraudulent budget in the coming months. This government will have to go to the people knowing that nothing it says can be believed and that none of its promises are credible. It will be at that time that the Australian people will pass their verdict on this high taxing, self-indulgent government.

         I would now like to make a few comments, as we are debating these measures cognately, on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1995-96. This particular bill appropriates funding of $144.46 million for the year ending 30 June 1996. There may also be some additional appropriations for increases in salaries. The extra amounts may be issued only for the purpose of increase in salaries and in payments in the nature of salary, and the minister must report the amount so issued to the parliament. If the description of the purpose of an appropriation refers to net appropriation, then this is taken to provide that any moneys received may be credited to the item, on the conditions agreed to by the minister and the presiding officer responsible for the department.

         The bill also allows for any money in relation to the Senate or the House of Representatives in excess of specific appropriations to be charged to an advance to the Speaker of the House of Representatives or to an advance to the President of the Senate. After allowing for any repayments, the total expenditure must not exceed the amount appropriated for the advances. As with the other two appropriation bills, this bill allows for modifications to reflect the Financial Management and Accountability Bill, should it commence before 30 June 1995.

         This bill is concerned with the running of the parliament and the funding of its operations. We must, however, always be aware that many of our fellow Australians are still doing it tough. We must always be on our guard so that parliament, while fulfilling its role as a democratic institution in contact with people, is not wasteful and extravagant of taxpayers' money. While agreeing to this bill now, the coalition will gladly be committed to ensuring that the parliament is not wasteful and self-indulgent.
