          The Port Melbourne site is a converted paint factory on a state government lease. It has been the subject of an adverse OH&amp;S investigation and is inadequate due to its old buildings, lack of space and high infrastructure cost. The proposed complex will amalgamate two research groups of the newly formed Division of Minerals who are currently dispersed—one being at Clayton and the other at Port Melbourne. The amalgamation will allow improved communications between the two groups in synergy with other CSIRO divisions already on the Clayton site and at Monash University.

          That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Joint venture development with Delfin Property Group of The Willows, Townsville, for defence housing.

        <para>
         There is a need to provide adequate housing for service families posted to Townsville, for which the Defence Housing Authority—referred to as the DHA—is responsible. Originally, DHA formed a joint venture with Delfin Property Group to tender for an attractive parcel of land at Douglas in Townsville. Unfortunately, the tender was unsuccessful. But soon after DHA, on behalf of the joint venture, successfully negotiated the acquisition of 107 hectares of land at Kirwan  known as the Willows, which was available for sale by the receivers of Kern Corporation.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The DHA acquired the land on behalf of the joint venture, subject to the approval of the public works committee and the minister. The joint venture has proceeded with the development of a portion of the land on the eastern side of the main stormwater drain with the approval of the public works committee and wishes to proceed with the development of the balance of the land. It is intended that the DHA acquire approximately 25 per cent of the lots from the joint venture at a reasonable discount and thereon provide new housing for service families which has been specifically designed for the local climate. The total development cost for the joint  venture is estimated to be $37 million. However, the maximum exposure for DHA is approximately $3.8 million in mid-1995. I commend the motion to the House.

         To fully understand many of this bill's implications, it is important to have a background understanding of what these measures involve. With regard to the new schools policy, in order to gain provisional approval and eventually final approval for general recurrent funding, schools must meet certain eligibility criteria, including an advanced notification requirement and a sufficiently high funding priority. Under the 1992 act, a school wishing to operate at a new location, amalgamate, provide an additional level of education or separate into two or more schools must give notice two years before 1 March in the year in which the change is proposed. The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 extends this notice period to three years before 31 October for changes proposed on or after 1 January 1997.

         Clause 23 of this bill introduces a further notification requirement for changes or proposals intended to occur on or after 1 January 1998 so that notification of a change or proposal to be funded in 1998 will be required by 31 October 1995. Keep in mind, Mr Speaker, that we are already a quarter of the way into 1995 and not only has this bill not been passed but one must question the ability of schools which have not acted pending the outcome of this bill to give adequate notification by the end of October this year.

         The coalition maintains its policy position of the last election, which is to abandon the new schools policy. Make no mistake about it: Labor has always been philosophically opposed to non-government school education, and this policy is just one example of this outdated philosophical position. The principal objective of this policy is to make it as difficult as possible for new schools to start. It is that simple. The policy is opposed to real parental choice in schooling, with the post-1992 funding policy effectively pricing non-government schools out of the reach of many parents. The coalition is committed to parental choice in schooling and we believe that this should be an affordable choice.

         Turning to the block grants authority proposal, under the general element grant administered by DEET, funds are provided in the form of block grants to state education authorities for the government sector and to block grant authorities—BGAs—for the non-government sector. There are two BGAs in each state—one Catholic and one independent—and there is a joint Catholic-independent BGA in both the Northern Territory and the ACT. This bill amends the principal act by removing the requirement to re-approve a block grant authority every time a school or hostel joins or leaves a BGA. I am sure the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) will be pleased to hear that this proposal is supported by the coalition, as it will clearly not only simplify the existing arrangements but also will do away with unnecessary administrative burdens.

The policy is restrictive, intrusive and designed to restrict true parental choice. The coalition has been vehemently opposed to this policy since its introduction. It is an issue on which we believe very strongly and it is an issue on which we have consistently campaigned in successive elections. Unlike the government, the coalition still listens to those who work in the field of non-government schools. They have said to us that the policy should be renamed the `no new schools policy' as it significantly retards new schools growth.

         The former Minister for Employment, Education and Training, now Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), declared in a press release prior to the last election that to abandon the new schools policy would be to `abandon the government's stable, needs-based system school funding'.

To abolish this policy would be to adopt—and I again quote from a press release by the former minister—`out of date and unworkable education policies'. So wedded is the government to its policy, so proud is the government of its stranglehold over non-government sector that in this very chamber on 7 October 1992 the minister stated:

The press release announced the view, and in doing so, gave the most spurious of reasons for the policy backflip and that is, `that the environment in which schools operate has changed'. And the evidence for this? According to the minister, it is the expanded use of computers and increased retention rates. How this in any way can be used as justification for the review will be lost on the non-government sector.It is a proposition that totally lacks any credibility.

         I am sure the minister saw press comments some months ago about proposed cuts to the education sector and would be aware that if they were to come into place it would totally decimate Australia's non-government sector. I must admit that I really am very surprised that the minister did not move to in any way cut short the debate on this. There was no denial from him. Nothing at all came out which would indicate that he either supported or denied those mooted cost cuttings.

         The question that must be asked, given his silence, is whether he is indicating support for the proposed measures. Equally importantly, may they become a budget reality as opposed to a departmental review? The other matter of great concern to the school sector is the government's constant about face and buck passing in relation to various matters of great concern to the school sector. I vividly remember holding the government to account for the drastic decline in retention rates, only to be told by the minister in a press release of 30 January 1995:

        On 4 June 1994, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) boasted to this House, `Of course we have now increased retention rates in schools to nearly 80 per cent.' However, the most glaring statement to this House which makes crystal clear the extent of the minister's duplicity was made on 8 November 1994. He said:

        It appears that everyone knows who is responsible for the retention rates except you or, should I say, only when it is convenient for you to know. The minister is trying to emulate the feats of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) whose selective memory is legend not only in this House but also in the state of Western Australia. Let us be in no doubt that through the review of the new schools policy, and the possible slashing of funds to the non-government sector, we are seeing the government establish a framework to avoid taking responsibility for the non-government sector. This is Labor's true commitment to the non-government school sector.

The coalition supports this measure and we believe it is long overdue. However, Australian parents have every cause to be doubtful as to how well this initiative will work once implemented. After all, the government's record on literacy is one of distortion of the truth, and a never-ending stream of go nowhere funding with no result.

         I would like to place on record the initiatives we have had to date from Labor over 12 years in office. We have had the International Literacy Year 1990; the literacy challenge, strategies for early intervention for literacy and learning for Australian children, December 1992; International Literacy Day on 8 September 1990; early literacy programs; adult literacy programs; the 1991 Australian language and literacy policy; the `Book it' program of 1990; and the literacy awards in 1992—and the government is currently administering a national literacy survey. Not only is the minister, in his own words, not sure of the end result of these past efforts on the state of our literacy, but up to 25 per cent of Australian school children are battling literacy problems. What is needed is accountability and testing of basic skills. States such as Victoria and New South Wales are showing much needed leadership in this area. If the government were serious about improving these figures, it would tell its left wing union teacher mates to back off and allow such testing to continue.

        It is hard to see why teachers oppose the formal testing of the basic competence of eight and 10-year-old children in Victorian schools. If the tests reveal problems, surely that will be valuable information for teachers, parents and schools as they work to enable all children to reach their full potential. Surely this should be the aim of education; not to treat every child as if they have the same potential or can achieve the same outcome.

         But surely the question of testing is not something that this minister or this government should be opposed to. I would have thought it was basic to ascertain whether there are problems and, if there are problems, then you can address them.

I have been informed that, although supplementation of recurrent grants is usually paid at the end of the schooling year, this was not the case in 1994. The reason, it would appear, was that the unexpectedly high amount of supplementation caused the minister to give long consideration to whether he would fulfil the government's commitment to supplementation in line with movements in the AGSRC.

         —I have been listening closely to the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), and I say to him at the outset that I, along with other government members, refute totally the suggestion that the ALP is in any way philosophically opposed to non-government school education. I think the member for Ballarat, along with many of his colleagues, has lapsed in time back to the lacklustre days of Menzies when the state aid debate raged through this parliament.

         The truth of the history of government funding for non-government schools brings enormous credit to the Australian Labor Party. Funding of non-government schools in this country was first proposed by a Labor government in New South Wales in the early 1960s—a Labor government in the early sixties wanting to fund, for the first time, non-government schools. To this proposition Menzies responded, typically as a political opportunist, with a limited proposal for the federal funding of non-government schools and their science blocks. The truth of the matter is that substantial federal funding of those schools did not come into place until the election of the Whitlam Labor government in 1972 and establishment of the Australian Schools Commission in 1973.

         I provide the member for Ballarat with some of the background. The national government has been providing funding for specific purposes for schools in Australia since 1964—that limited Menzies proposition. Since that time, both the scope and size of Commonwealth outlays for schooling have increased substantially. Expenditure on school education through the various states grants acts has grown from $9.9 million in 1964-65—that is, less than $10 million after 15 years of Menzies Liberal government. The member for Ballarat should note that. He talked about truancy. He must have been playing truant when it came to Australian political history lessons during his time at school.

         The grants and aid grew from less than $10 million during the period of Menzies to outlays in 1994 of over $1 billion for government schools and $1,563 million for non-government schools—$1.5 billion of Commonwealth assistance for non-government schools established and confirmed by this Labor government. For the member for Ballarat to suggest that there is any philosophical opposition to non-government school education on the part of the Keating government is an absurdity. I am sure that the member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), a strong supporter of non-government and government schools throughout the country and his own electorate, would agree that the schools would all say, `If that is the philosophical opposition of the Australian Labor Party in 1994-95—$1.5 billion of funding for non-government schools—let's have more of it.'

         On the substance of this legislation, its purpose is essentially threefold: to require greater notice of proposals to establish new non-government schools which seek government funding or alter the status of non-government schools receiving government funding; to introduce procedures for situations where additional levels of education are introduced progressively at a particular school; and to establish a list of priority languages for which Commonwealth grants shall be paid. I support these purposes entirely, but I also wish to make some broader observations about the effectiveness of the nation's school education system. I do so against a background of rapid change in teaching and the learning environment in Australia's schools.

         During my lifetime, and it is an experience which I am sure has been shared by the member for Parramatta, there have been two great changes in the school education system. The first is, as I have mentioned, Commonwealth involvement—substantial Commonwealth funding of both the government and non-government school sectors. Unfortunately, this has not led to the creation of a national system. We have had enormous growth in national funding, but we are yet to establish a national school education system in Australia. We are still relying on eight state and territory based systems. There are obvious problems such as a lack of coordination, a lack of efficiency, a lack of integration and the tremendous difficulties that arise with students who, because of their parents moving across territorial and state boundaries, move into new education systems with different standards, different curricula and different requirements.

         The second change in school education during my lifetime has been the convergence of general and vocational education. Schools have become much more concerned, particularly in the past decade, with the question of employability and the provision of broad vocational education. This represents a convergence not only of general and vocational education in schools but also a convergence between the concept of work and the concept of education.

         It is now recognised that the most successful forms of work organisation are those which encourage people to be multiskilled, creative and adaptable. In this sense, the quality of Australia's school education system has become a key determinant of competitive advantages and disadvantages for the national economy.

         With the proliferation and pace of international capital movements, human resources and skills have become the primary means by which national economies compete against each other. All other factor markets—resources, capital formation and technological progress—have jumped over and well beyond national boundaries, particularly with the development of knowledge-based industries.

         In the 1950s and 1960s in Australia young people looked forward to employment once they, through the school education system, had acquired relatively simple and repetitious skills. This was because our economy was organised around systems of high-volume, standardised production. Whether in agriculture, manufacturing or office work, each employee took a simple but interconnected part in the production process through which productivity was guaranteed by high volumes and low unit costs.

         Skill requirements for adaptability and innovation were restricted to a small group of managers who planned and designed the production process. Most workers simply followed orders within the limits of rigid work roles and job classifications. If they did this with due discipline and tolerance, then their working life would most likely require just one set of simple trade based skills.

         I take inspiration and guidance from the policies outlined by the US Labour Secretary, Robert Reich, in his 1989 book,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          The resurgent liberal
         </emphasis>
         . Of course, he is talking about small `l' liberals. There is nothing resurgent about the big `L' Liberals in this place. Reich, nonetheless, states in his book from 1989:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        for managers this path means continuously retraining employees for more complex tasks, automating in ways that cut routine tasks and enhance worker flexibility and creativity, diffusing responsibility for innovation, taking seriously labour's concern for job security and giving the workers a stake in improved productivity via profit-linked bonuses and stock plans. For workers this means accepting flexible job classifications and work rules, agreeing to wage rates linked to productivity improvements, and generally taking greater responsibility for the soundness and efficiency of the enterprise.
       </para>
       <para>
        Reich goes on to outline how such an economy relies, above all, on a work force capable of rapid learning. The key transformation is how policy makers in this area, including the member for Ballarat, should be linking changes in the nature of work to changes in the school education system. Reich has this to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Because the future economy will depend to an even greater extent on thinking, rather than repeating learned information, future reforms must motivate teachers and students alike to engage in the process of learning. Rather than prescribe exactly what should be learned and how and when the information should be doled out, reformers should aim at improving students' capacity to learn . . . . rather than teach students to assume that problems and solutions are generated by others (as they were under high-volume standardised production), students should be led to understand that problems and questions are created . . . . the emphasis should be on allowing students to experiment for themselves with solving the problems they help define.

        One could not find a better statement of the challenge for educators and education policy makers in the 1990s—to have teachers who engage students in the process of learning. I think that matches the experience that members of parliament would have had in their own school years.

         Studies have found that few people remember any amount of the content they were taught at school. The lasting significance of the school education system is to pick up a certain way of learning, a certain way of thinking. That is a very important point to understand. It is not so much the content that people take away from school, not so much the rote learning and knowledge; it is a process of learning, a way of thinking. If we use this commonsense proposition—something that happens in any case in the school education system—we can certainly produce schooling in Australia in the 1990s better suited to the new nature of work and changes in employment.

         The link between school education and employment is still, by my assessment, underestimated in the public debate. Our emphasis in this parliament and through government policy in recent years has been on post-school training and retraining—such as the Working Nation program implemented by DEET. This, unfortunately, by my assessment has left the school education system and its contribution to training and work force skills as a second order consideration. It should not be so. It should be a first order consideration.

         In Australia, the comprehensive system has focused on minimum standards across the nation without linkages to regional economic development. Even so, fast growing regions have been under-resourced in education through the recent period of spending restraint. Yet these are the areas that require the greatest boost to human skills. As Gregory and Hunter concluded from their study of the spatial structure of the labour market:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The structural change of Australian employment into less manual work in the service sector has favoured those workers in the good regions with more education. The workers in the low status areas have largely failed to secure employment in the growth industries and appear to move into the unemployment pool once they lose their jobs in manufacturing.
       </para>
       <para>
        This highlights a failure to match the school education system to the economic restructuring process still under way in Australia. The process of restructuring has changed the nature and the definitions we apply to work force skills. In the 1950s and 1960s it was assumed that white-collar work was relatively high skilled and that blue-collar work would be relatively low skilled. Now, with an internationalised economy in the 1990s, there is an entirely different definition of skills and their requirements in employment.

         It is the traded sector, the sector exposed to international competition, that requires the highest level of skills, be that in white- or blue-collar work. Close to my electorate, I recall an inspection of the Alcatel factory where the workers were producing telephone switching equipment for a large market in China. They were not wearing blue overalls but white lab coats. This reflects how the manufacturing work environment now requires an intensely capable level of education and skill development.

         It is the non-traded sector that is more likely to have the relatively low skill base. This refers to those sectors of the economy, such as community services and the retail sector, that are not exposed to international competition and not part of any internationalised production process. This demonstrates some of the problems that have occurred in making the transformation, the adjustment, in skills and job opportunities.

         Unhappily, there has been a concentration of unemployment in a group of regional economies. Poverty rates have become a problem. Welfare dependency has become a problem. In fact, the correlation between public housing, poverty rates and unemployment is strong, based on location. My colleague the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has said that you can predict someone's employment and lifetime aspirations based on their postcode.

This problem is particularly acute in disadvantaged regions, reflected ultimately in higher rates of long-term unemployment.

         Compared with other OECD nations, Australia has a low participation rate of its 15- to 18-year-olds in vocational education. We need to turn that around. We turn it around by applying work experience and vocation based training not only in years 11 and 12, but also years 9 and 10. The education system in this country has traditionally been seen as a source of meritocracy; the great equality of opportunity and great liberator of the disadvantaged. This was true during the period of full employment in Australia, but it is a more difficult proposition to sustain when the country has less than full employment; especially when, with the greater emphasis on labour force skills, access to employment depends, firstly, on how well someone performs within the school education system and, secondly, where someone lives—his or her post code.

There needs to be a shift from this 1960s model where the smarter kids go on to university and the rest get a job in the full employment labour market. That is no longer the environment in the 1990s. There needs to be greater input from business people, industry leaders and those interested in vocational training to ensure the entrance score and rank in year 12 is based as much around vocational work force needs as for tertiary education.

My fourth proposition is to change the nature of teacher training so that it adapts to the new economic environment. Again I refer members to page 78 of the Schools Council report.

         There are a lot of caring and intelligent people who would be absolutely wonderful doctors. It was rather intriguing that the college at the University of Queensland, which I had the great honour of being president of when I was there, introduced a system where we elected a resident doctor, a resident lawyer and a resident expert in each field so that anyone in the college who had a legal problem could go along to the resident lawyer and get advice, and similarly with the resident doctor. The resident experts were people in their last year or two years of their course or who may have been tutoring in their profession.

They wanted someone who cared about them and someone who, if he did not have the knowledge, would have the humility to go to someone who did have the knowledge to find out what needed to be done to fix them up. When the students were given the choice of whom they wanted, even people that had come out of the apex, if you like, of the academic system of the colleges at Queensland University—you had to have a very high mark to get in there in the first place—they did not opt for the academic achiever; they opted for the carer.

I asked him, `Why? Explain that to me.' He said, `Because, under subjective assessment, I have got a teacher who does not like me.'

         reality that has come upon society—and no matter how much you want to go into a particular field that is cut off to you—but also our children are cast to the tender mercies of some enormously petty-minded school teachers who, for some personal vendetta reasons, may completely, or do their best to, destroy their entire future.

         In days past, we had on-the-job training. People were not sent off to an elite institution. Having gone through the University of Queensland, I know it is very hard to go to a university, particularly that type of university, and not come out thinking that you are a great gift to humanity. In his book, Trevor Sykes delineates the terrible occurrences of the 1980s, with the loss of $28,000 million in this country.

         I spoke with a very successful businessman in North Queensland who told me that he was the youngest ever credit manager for the Bank of New South Wales in Queensland—Westpac, as it is now called. I asked him why he got out of banking and he told me it was because he could see the disasters coming. I thought he meant those in the 1980s and he said, `No, that wasn't quite what I meant. That was a manifestation of the disasters.' So I asked him what he was referring to and he said, `As a kid, you started working in a bank as a clerk. Typically, you were sent out to a western town where you were forced to play football with the local yokels. Rich, poor, black or white—you were all cast into the same football team. You perhaps belonged to the local Apex club, and you knew everybody in your community. You also knew their bank accounts: who was paying up, who was reliable and who wasn't.'

         He continued by saying, `Then you rose to be a teller and probably joined Lions, Rotary or something like that. You had a very intimate knowledge of and a responsibility to oversight their accounts. When you became manager your toes were cut off with a rusty razor blade if you failed to make the right decisions about people. But you learnt and understood people, which was by far the most important thing in banking.' I then asked him what the disaster was that befell banking in Australia and he said, `All of those positions that I occupied were cut of completely.'

         The businessman then told me that in Queensland through the 1980s all of those positions were made available only to the bright young MBAs coming out of the universities—interestingly enough, a lot of them foreign universities. He said that a Harvard MBA almost guaranteed you a senior position in the Bank of New South Wales or the National Bank. He said, `Can you imagine one of those bright young elitist "gifts to the world" being taken to dinner in a Rolls Royce by the likes of tough, rough nuts like Alan Bond? Do you really think he would have had the temerity to raise the issue of security value at the lunch? Not likely! It would have been naive for a person of his stature to talk of such a petty matter. He would have had no understanding of human nature to go with it. That led to what happened in the 1980s.' I think he made a very interesting statement.

         Another very important issue needs to be canvassed. I sat down on one occasion and went through what I thought were the 23 major technological breakthroughs in the last hundred years. With one exception, which was radio, the other 22 major breakthroughs—whether they were television, the electric light, the telephone, the motor car, the internal combustion engine, refrigeration, the polarisation of light or photography—were achieved by people who had no tertiary qualifications. Isn't that interesting? A lot of people in argument to that would say that in the old days a lot of people did not have tertiary qualifications. I expect that argument, but the instamatic camera and the polarisation of light were pretty recent inventions of Edwin Land. The jet engine, which was effectively invented in the last year or two of the Second World War, was another invention by a person without tertiary qualifications.

         A lot of commentators on these issues say, `What you have here is an assessment on the basis of your ability to memorise and regurgitate the conventional wisdom. A person that is very good at absorbing the conventional wisdom and accepting it without questioning is a person that will be very good at the examination system.' Edward De Bono would say that he is an absolutely hopeless ass when it comes to formulating something new. As one person put to me recently, `The last thing in the world we want is someone on steel rails. We want a four-wheel drive operator.' He was talking about a mental four-wheel drive operator; a person able to see the opportunities and move in any particular direction.

         I think there is a very important part to be played by universities with regard to these matters—that is, as libraries, sets of living encyclopedias and marketplaces for information. They should be right there with the runners—the Edisons, Ottos, Alexander Bells and all of their modern equivalents—understanding those breakthroughs, stepping side by side with those breakthroughs and being able to provide that information to the wider community upon request.

         It impossible not to go sideways for a second and reflect upon that most incredible person, Henry Ford. Every single year for the 22 years that Henry Ford produced his famous motor car, the model T Ford, the price went down, not up. For 22 years, every single year, that car got cheaper and cheaper. As many model T Fords were sold as all the cars sold in the rest of the world put together. Here was a person who had built the motor car. I think other people could claim to have built the motor car but, if we had to look to someone who was the most successful inventor of the motor car, we would look no further than him.

They found him, after searching the world, in the Ford factory: it was a kid who had been paid to sweep. He was shoved over to be a worker in metallurgy and rose to be the head of the metallurgy section. He was the person that knew most about metallurgy in the whole world. They had the money to buy the best. They had the money to search the world for the best and the best was already there.

         That great raconteur, Malcolm Muggeridge, said that modern education is very much like the giant armadillo of prehistoric times. With every successive wave of evolution, the giant armadillo clothed itself in more and more armour plating until, eventually, it was invulnerable from attack from any other animal that walked the earth. It was a great evolutionary achievement. However, there was one problem. The armour was so heavy the armadillo could not forage for food and it very rapidly became extinct. There are no giant armadillos today.

         The most important thing I have to say today is that, sadly, without an education almost every door is closed. In society today, with the crushing of the agricultural sector in Australia by this government and other governments—I do not hesitate to say that—and the crushing of small business, all doors are now closed. The corporations own everything. The corporations will own everything so, if you cannot get a job with a corporation or the government—you most certainly cannot get jobs with them without degrees or tertiary qualifications—every door of opportunity is closed.

         Nowadays, not only do people living outside the cities and very large towns not have a right to tertiary education but also they do not have a right to secondary education. Areas I represent in North Queensland, such as Feluga, Normanton, Georgetown, Burketown, Richmond and Julia Creek—and, sadly, soon probably towns like Winton—will be left without secondary education. Recently, the Julia Creek school lost all of its secondary department. The only way people in these areas can secure an education is to go away to boarding school. There is no other way it can be done. It is ludicrous to say that people can gain a secondary education by correspondence. There is too much competitiveness out there, and figures clearly indicate that that is the case. Very few even try. There is no secondary education in those sorts of areas unless you can go away to boarding school.

         When I was a young person, unless you were rich you could not go to boarding school. By Cloncurry standards, I was lucky enough to belong to a rich family and was able to go away to school. Later on, if you were of Aboriginal descent, you could go to boarding school. I can remember being embarrassed that I had this great advantage over 80 per cent of the kids in Cloncurry. I could go as far as I wanted to because I had a secondary education and they did not. Kids from boarding schools walked with pride. They had been out in the bigger world and tried themselves against bigger people. They had this thing called education, which they could intimidate everybody else with for the rest of their days. It was very sad. I can remember the embarrassment I felt during those years.

         I was lucky enough to be in a government which pioneered in Australia equality of education, so education in Queensland was provided on an equal basis for every single person. Through the 1970s and 1980s, the entire cost of going away to boarding school was picked up by the state and federal governments. Because of the inaction of this House, and because of the inaction of the Queensland government, now only half the cost of sending children away to boarding school is covered. I am not talking about elitist GPS schools, as we call them in Queensland; I am talking about ordinary garden variety service schools, which are the sorts of schools I boarded at in Charters Towers. They believe they have a duty to provide something the kids must have, which is a secondary education at the cheapest possible cost.

         But, even with those schools, you are still looking at a shortfall of about $6,000. If you have two or three kids and come from a town such as Hughenden, where the cost of living is 26 per cent higher than Brisbane—I am quoting specifically from two separate reports—there is no way in the world you can afford to send your kids away to school. It is impossible. We are now back to the bad old days where education is available only—I am not talking about tertiary education; I am talking about secondary education—to the rich or those of Aboriginal descent, whose numbers are much smaller. This is a dreadful indictment upon this government and other governments of Australia, and must be fixed up.

         I should begin by saying that there are few more important tasks than the one Australia's 220,000 teachers carry out every day of their working lives—it is important to acknowledge the work of the educators of our children—namely, educating our children and helping them become responsible citizens not only in this country but in the whole world. There are few jobs that would be more challenging and ultimately more rewarding. I understand that the Australian Teaching Council is attempting to have International Teachers Day acknowledged and celebrated every year. I wish them well in that pursuit.

This program will replace an existing one which supports eight languages in each state and territory. The bill also gives effect to changes to strengthen the Commonwealth's new schools policy from the new and changing non-government schools, changes to simplify administrative arrangements for improving block grant authorities under the capital grants program for schools, and funding schedules for capital grants for government and non-government schools for 1995 and funding schedules for grants for community language for 1995.

         This bill is an example of this government's commitment to education for young Australians, the country's future. It is an outstanding commitment that this government has shown over the many years it has been in office. I think we would all agree that the key to a successful future, both as individuals and as a nation, is a good education. The member  for Kennedy was probably right in highlighting the need for a good education, which is available to many young people today. Australia can be justifiably proud of its record in providing a good education to our children, and the high rate of school retention to year 12—currently near the 80 per cent mark—shows that the policies of the past have been winners with young Australians. They are the policies of this government.

         A brief analysis of Commonwealth funding and the level of enrolments over 1988-92 clearly illustrates this commitment. In each year of that period, the percentage increase in funding actually exceeded the percentage increase in enrolments. So we could say that the federal government has had funding levels that have exceeded the growth in demand for student numbers. This is enhanced further when we consider the current figures for Commonwealth grants. For government schools in 1994 it is estimated to be $1,073 million, and non-government schools receive approximately $1,563 million.

         The committee is to determine the category in which the proposed school falls on the basis of a number of criteria such as the demographics of the school's catchment area, the planned provision of other schools in the area and the level of use of existing facilities. If the proposed school satisfies the relevant criteria it is to be given provisional approval for funding. Existing non-government schools in receipt of Commonwealth funds were required prior to 1993 to notify the relevant committee of all proposals to vary their operations. Notification was required two years before the proposed change, which had to be approved by the committee.

I worked for the Bank of New South Wales, but he was not talking about me. In a sector such as banking we must have ongoing education. People need to get a better education as time goes on. As things changed in that sector, bank employees had to change as well; they had to take the opportunities to extend their own career options. I know from my own experience of that industry that when bank employees actually took the initiative and studied at night and were dedicated to improving their opportunities they did particularly well. I say, `Good on them'. They were prepared to give up their leisure time and lots of their weekends and evenings to spend studying so they could improve their lot in life, so good on them. Managing to obtain a better education has made them better people. That is progress; things move on. We have had to improve our education as we go.

Many of them have done it: good on them. I think we should acknowledge their contributions as well because the industry will only improve in that way.

         I wish to turn to some aspects of the bill regarding the priority of languages. The priority of language incentive commenced in 1992. It provides funds to increase the number of students learning a priority language other than English. This too is an important area. For those of us who have the opportunity to travel from time to time—it is one of the things that we as members of parliament get the opportunity to do—it has really brought home to us that Australians, as isolated as we are, need to have at least a second language to communicate with people in other parts of the world. If we are to be a much more forward-looking nation we have to ensure that our people can speak other languages.

         Last Friday morning when I returned home to my electorate I attended a school at Redbank to hand out school badges to the young people there. I was speaking to a grade seven teacher there who came from Holland and was able to speak seven languages. Certainly when he was living in Holland he had a greater advantage as he was only a couple of kilometres away from another country which had another language, but by being able to speak seven languages he has been able to move around. He actually taught in Italy at one stage. The benefits of that sort of an education are second to none.

         The priority languages incentive element provides funds to increase the number of students actually learning a priority language other than English. In 1992, $5.4 million was paid under the program in respect of 18,149 students, a per capita rate of $300. The principal act allows the minister to determine a list of priority languages, currently 10, and allows the relevant state minister to determine that a maximum of eight of these languages is a priority language for grants to the state. If a state minister does not determine that a language is a priority language for the state, assistance is not available in respect of students of that language.

          A number of languages are covered under the priority languages incentive element scheme. The languages that will be supported include Aboriginal languages, Arabic, French, German, Italian, modern Greek, Russian, Spanish, Thai and Vietnamese. That is a very important initiative.

         , which was a report of the inquiry into Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander language maintenance. I had the privilege of chairing the subcommittee which delivered that report. Of course, the chairman of the full committee was the honourable member for Denison and now Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr).

         The committee finds it intolerable that while most migrant children with a first language other than English have been able to study that language up to matriculation level, most Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children cannot study their language at high school. As states and territories move to make LOTE compulsory the situation is exacerbated even further. Dr Schmidt cites as an example the NSW Education Department spending $3000 in 1989 for just one student to sit a Higher School Certificate exam in Estonian.

        This bill contains amendments to the funding and disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, arising out of the government's response to the interim report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters entitled
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Financial reporting by political parties
        </emphasis>
        and out of further submissions made by the major political parties. The bill deals with changes to four aspects of the electoral funding provisions of our electoral laws. These are simplification of paper work, the method of payment of public funding entitlement to parties and candidates, an increase in that entitlement and provisions seeking to close loopholes in the disclosure provisions.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The bill provides for simplification of what the committee rightly saw as unnecessarily onerous reporting requirements for registered political parties. Parties will no longer have to report particulars of their financial transactions in the minute detail the legislation required. The recitation of this minutiae served no useful purpose in achieving the policy objectives underpinning the legislation. Those objectives are, of course, to force disclosure of donations to candidates or their parties that might appear to influence a parliamentarian or a political party's position in the parliament.

         Obviously, the tens of thousands of small individual donations that are made at the time of elections do not fall into this category. The committee, in its wisdom, recommended higher thresholds before individual donations had to be included or highlighted in returns. The bill raises the threshold figure from $100 to $500 and nominates $1,500 as the sum at which donors must report and be reported. As the annual returns which political parties will be required to furnish under the proposed amendments will contain less detail than previously, the due date for furnishing them has been brought forward from 20 weeks to 16 weeks after the end of the financial year.

         Consistent with the approach of simplifying procedures and avoiding unnecessary paperwork, parties will no longer be obliged to file a detailed election claim in the election year regurgitating financial information that will also be in their annual return. They will, however, have to lodge a return itemising major expenditure in respect of the election campaign. For some time now, parties have been complaining that payment of public funding has arrived long after the election. This was unavoidable in a system that required the parties to prepare highly detailed claims and lodge them and then have the AEC attend to the time consuming processing of hundreds of claims.

         Neither the political parties nor the AEC are overendowed with staff and the system placed great strain on their resources.

          These changes will provide an estimated additional $14.656 million of public funding for registered political parties and entitled candidates, based on the payments made for the 1993 general election.

         A loophole in the existing legislation which is addressed by this bill relates to the operation of trust funds and similar organisations—including companies—which function wholly or mainly for the benefit of a registered political party or a number of political parties. To appreciate the extent to which the disclosure provisions are being flouted one need only examine the latest returns of the opposition parties. The Liberal Party, for example, has revealed that it has received income of $7.2 million laundered through a trust called the Free Enterprise Foundation.

         The bill provides that trusts and related entities must provide annual returns to the Electoral Commission containing substantially the same information as parties are required to report. However, where an amount was paid to or for the benefit of one or more registered political parties from funds generated by capital of that entity, each person who contributed to the capital must be identified in the return. Following on from this is a provision which makes these entities subject to compliance investigations by officers authorised by the Australian Electoral Commission.

Donors of gifts of $500 or more, totalling more than $1,500, must be disclosed in an annual return of a political party. However, donors of gifts to a political party which total $1,500 or more during a financial year will be required to furnish an annual return.

The simple realities are that the Western Australian government was thrown out—and rightly so—over an interesting exercise called WA Inc. That was the case involving the activities of the Labor Party. A former premier is—or was—a guest in Her Majesty's gaol.

There is nothing illegal about that; I am not suggesting that there is. I am simply making the point that there are mechanisms which Labor has been only too happy to use over many years, certainly since 1984 when federal funding was first introduced, and which make it rather rich for the minister to seriously suggest that they are lilywhite and that everybody else is besmirched by allegations of this nature.

         Consequently, the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 has been brought into this place as a result of a report brought down by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, and it amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act in a number of ways. On our side of politics we would have liked to have seen a number of other amendments made to the Commonwealth Electoral Act in ways that would ensure that the result of an election in fact accurately represented the decision of the Australian people.

For instance, at the present time there is no need to prove identity to be able to enrol to vote. The Electoral Commission should trial a system of voter cards, there should be a continuous review of the electoral roll, subdivisional voting should be reintroduced and compulsory voting should be abolished.

The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) outlined a number of the very minute transactions that he experienced had to be carried out within Liberal Party branches. I have even heard that, on occasions, a Liberal Party branch had been required to count the number of tea bags it held in stock—no doubt these rules also apply to the Labor Party. Clearly, the minute requirements for accounting, which have been in place until now, were an unintended consequence of the legislation.

Therefore, it is eminently appropriate that the agent of a political party have the right to attend compliance investigations into local party units.

         I should make one point in relation to amendment Nos 1 to 3 of clause 5, which relates to gifts to political parties. The minister is no doubt aware that this proposal will commence only on the date of agreement by the Governor-General. There is a real probability that that is going to be remarkably close to 30 June 1995, which is when the act is said to commence. Consequently, there could be an overlap problem, and that is worth serious consideration. There is no doubt the Electoral Commission will have to make sure all political parties are aware of the timing components in that particular matter.

         I also refer to item 12, new division 5A, which removes the relevance of the time for claims to be made and lodged. The 20th day after polling day is the deadline for lodging an agreement dividing the election funding payment in respect of a Senate group jointly endorsed by two registered parties. That, of course, is relevant to the coalition for obvious reasons. In many states, we have a joint ticket shared by both the Liberal Party and the National Party. Consequently, we will need to be fully involved in that process.

         But, overall, the amendments have the agreement of the opposition.

         —I wish to table the supplementary explanatory memorandum and make one comment on this alleged retrospectivity argument. It has been put to me at a fairly late stage in these proceedings—too late to effectively prepare amendments—that there is an element of retrospectivity in that, prior to 1992, donors to these funds would have had no possible knowledge of parliament's intention to force this form of disclosure. I must say that I find that argument quite persuasive. But I think it is a matter that deserves further consideration. It will have further consideration as this bill proceeds through the parliament.

         —I take great pleasure in speaking on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994. This bill amends the State Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992 to give effect to initiatives announced in last year's budget. Under this bill, $8.7 million will be provided by the Commonwealth in 1995 to foster literacy development for children in the early years of schooling, and $4 million will be provided in 1995 in grants to school authorities to support the study of 10 priority languages. This program will replace an existing program which supports eight languages in each state and territory.

         The bill gives effect to changes to strengthen the Commonwealth's new schools policy for funding new and changing non-government schools and to simplify administrative arrangements for approving block grant authorities under the capital grants program for schools. It will also give effect to funding schedules for capital grants for government and non-government schools for 1995, funding schedules for grants for community languages for 1995 and a revised funding schedule for grants for rural student hostel projects from 1994 to 1996.

         The bill proposes to provide grants to foster literacy development for children in the early years of schooling. As I have already said, under the new provisions $8.7 million will be made available to assist children from kindergarten to year 3, with special emphasis on those disadvantaged by low socio-economic backgrounds. That is entirely consistent with the government's social justice focus and the importance of access and equity to the most disadvantaged in the community for whom this government believes so strongly. Additionally, $4 million will be made available to provide grants to school authorities to support the study of the 10 priority languages that I mentioned before.

         Education is one of the many important areas of social policy. It is about social justice and access and equity to Australia's young people, which is the reason the government places a high priority in getting the balance right and in social justice in education. Education is one of a number of policy areas which suffer from an unfortunate circumstance: under the constitution it is primarily a state government responsibility. Because the federal government provides a large amount of money to education, the funding of schools and vocational education is subject to Commonwealth-state agreements and relies on cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states, which is not always forthcoming.

         As the minister has outlined, 33 new government schools were opened in New South Wales last year. Only 10 schools were opened before 30 June. Obviously, in the second half of the year, the New South Wales government decided that an election was coming up and it had better get on with the opening of a few schools. These projects, funded either wholly or partially by the Commonwealth, totalled $47,098,000 in 1994. Of that, $27,255,000 was funded by the Commonwealth, or 57.87 per cent of the total cost of these projects.

         There has been a bit of a history in all states of state governments being pretty opportunistic in the way they take the electoral credit by taking every opportunity to open these schools with a lot of fanfare so guidelines have been put in place whereby, depending on the ratio of funding between the Commonwealth and the state, the Commonwealth government or the state government has opening rights or, in some cases, there are joint opening rights. As part of the guidelines for Commonwealth funding for these schools and TAFEs there is certainly a requirement for the federal minister or his representative to be able to address these functions.

         The system used by the New South Wales government to notify the Commonwealth of the dates of these openings technically breaches the guidelines. In 1994, it technically breached the guidelines in 100 per cent of cases. So, last year, every time a school was opened in New South Wales the New South Wales government breached the agreement with the Commonwealth on the protocol for these openings.

         The procedure used is that the New South Wales government notifies the minister's office of a date and will rarely change that date, even if it is unsuitable—for example, if federal parliament is sitting and the minister cannot get there. If federal members cannot get there, the New South Wales government still refuses to change the date even though in most cases there is more Commonwealth funding than New South Wales government funding.

         Sometimes the regional officers of the Department of Education in New South Wales set the date but the New South Wales government will still not change the date if it is unsuitable for the Commonwealth minister or federal members. In at least one instance this date has been unsuitable but an alternative date was not negotiated by the region or by the office of the state minister. Some examples are Gosford High School, Sydney Boys High School and Birchgrove Primary School, where the openings clashed with sitting dates of federal parliament. For some reason, the New South Wales government and its education department were not prepared to cooperate to enable the Commonwealth to be represented by an elected person. Four of these openings out of the 33 in New South Wales last year did clash with federal parliamentary sitting days.

         Let us look at what has happened in 1995. I mentioned that only 33 schools were opened in New South Wales for the whole of 1994, 23 of which were in the second half of the year. But this year by 25 March 1995, 45 government schools will have been opened in New South Wales. This compares with only one government school being opened in February or March in 1994. These 45 schools, as was the case with last year's schools, were funded wholly or in part by the Commonwealth government.

Funding for TAFE colleges was a total of $61,835,710, to which the Commonwealth contributed $55,859,710. The total is $129 million-odd of Commonwealth funding out of a total of $178.7 million for schools and TAFEs in New South Wales that have been opened or will be opened in February and March.

The New South Wales government notified our minister's office of the date, giving in most cases less than the required two months notice that is required under the Commonwealth-state agreement. Despite an approach by the minister to the New South Wales minister, Virginia Chadwick, in early January this year, the minister has refused to change any of the unsuitable dates. In fact, she did not even bother to answer the letter.

A school called the Portland Central School had some new classrooms and an administration block opened yesterday, even though the work on it will not finish until May.

Lo and behold, as soon as he announced he would not be standing for the forthcoming state election he was suddenly disinvited and Premier John Fahey decided he would do the opening instead.

         The honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) discovered by talking to some state education officials that he was not going to be invited or he was not going to be allowed to speak at these openings. Naturally he took umbrage at that, given that he had sought special permission and was fortunate enough to be granted leave from this place to attend. There was a fairly major bike race he had been instrumental in organising taking place last Monday, and he found—in the case of the three schools and the bike race he had organised—that Premier John Fahey did not want him anywhere near these events, let alone speaking at them. So he contacted the Premier's office and left a fairly concise and forthright message about the fact that he had not been invited. The Premier denied that there was any attempt to remove him from the speaking list at these three schools and the bike race.

          The Premier obviously had been caught out. He did not want to be seen as the petty Premier of New South Wales that he indeed is.

This is a classic example of politics in New South Wales.

         Because there has been a deliberate policy on the part of the New South Wales minister to open as many of these schools as she can get away with during federal parliamentary sitting weeks, despite the fact that there is so much Commonwealth money involved, unfortunately there was no elected federal government representative able to be present. The state member for Campbelltown, who happens to be a member of the Labor Party, Mr Michael Knight, was there but he was not afforded the opportunity to speak. My wife attended in my place but was not able to speak. Funnily enough, the minister for education, Virginia Chadwick, could not be bothered attending either. She was off around the countryside in some other marginal seat opening another school—probably the one at Lithgow in the electorate of the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons)—with federal government money.

         In the case of the Campbelltown Performing Arts High School the Commonwealth contribution was 100 per cent. It was funded 100 per cent by Commonwealth funding—$446,000. The New South Wales government contributed not one cent to that education facility—not one cent to the future of young children interested in the performing arts who attend that particular first-rate high school. Nevertheless, the New South Wales government trotted out not the minister, as I said, but a parliamentary secretary from the upper house who nobody had heard of—Richard Bull—the same person the New South Wales government trotted out to open the schools in Gilmore on Tuesday.

He, of course, talked about the New South Wales government's supposed great commitment to education. We heard about that yesterday. The New South Wales government is coming last in terms of funding per student. It is $250 per student behind the national average, I think that is right.

As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, my seat is in north-east Victoria. We have many dynamic and interesting school communities in north-east Victoria. Some of them are in the large cities such as Wodonga, Wangaratta, Benalla and Yarrawonga and others are in very small communities.

         In some cases, there are interstate arrangements. For example, in Corryong in the upper Murray near Mount Kosciusko, the schools have traditionally provided educational opportunities in primary and secondary schools, and now in TAFE, for students from New South Wales travelling each day across the state border. That is also the case along the Murray River. You will find many examples of school communities actually serving catchments in both states. That is as it should be. I, for one, believe that education knows no state borders, nor should it.

They do not, in every case, have access to the larger facilities that are available for children needing special teaching and assistance because they live in smaller communities separated from the larger cities.

         I have one example which I will give in a general sense without identifying the family so as not to embarrass it. In a Catholic school in Myrtleford there is a marvellous sister who, with her staff and the parents of a child with a profound hearing problem, has been able to make a remarkable contribution to the educational development of a particular little girl. As a result of the efforts and assistance of both Commonwealth and state education departments, the little girl's educational progress has been quite remarkable. She is, in fact, able to attend a normal, ordinary school in Myrtleford and, despite her profound hearing disability, is making good progress.

         This has only been made possible because an interpreter is available on a one-to-one basis for quite a lot of the school week to assist this child and the teachers to relate and for the child to participate in education. Honourable members should remember that, by reason of this sort of arrangement, the benefits are, firstly, that the child is able to stay in a normal family environment, living with mother and father in the country community and not having to go away to some distant part, separated from her parents. That is a bonus, and I do not have to explain the reason why.

         Secondly, it helps the school community understand and assist in the assimilation of children with disabilities. One of the greatest examples you can ever find of how successful it is to have children with disabilities in school communities is to see how children who do not have disabilities, who are going through school with these children—their mates—do not find any difference at all in their colleagues' position, even though in many cases they are profoundly disabled. It is great to see that manifestation, that development of understanding. The eventual erosion of discrimination against people with disabilities will come about because of the example being set in these circumstances and the way in which young Australians accept children in their school environment with disabilities as being just the same as they are. We should do all we can to encourage the continuation and development of these sorts of services.

         In the case that I am mentioning, the small amount of money that is required to pay for the interpreter services will not be available to the same extent for this child's continuing education in secondary schooling in Myrtleford. The reason is somewhat complicated. It is partly because the Catholic Education Office has to allocate its scarce resources amongst all these schools that need assistance in this area and the inability of the state and federal governments to provide additional funds to cope with all of the requests from the Catholic Education Office and other government schools in Victoria and the rest of Australia.

         Also, is it not a remarkable thing that Australia is suddenly waking up to itself about the need to skill our young children in other languages? I was told recently that parents in Japan are no longer seeking to have their children taught English as a second language. They are very pragmatic and their preference now is for the Cantonese language. We can well understand why, with a market of more than 1,000 million people right on their doorstep. With the knowledge that in future the world will very much involve China in the activities of every other country, especially those in Asia, it is understandable that parents in Japan would like their children to be able to converse in a skilled way in a language that the Chinese use.

         During his remarks he raised three matters that deserve some attention: the first concerns retention rates; the second concerns supplementation; and the third concerns the review of the new schools policy. I turn first of all to retention rates. It is true that retention rates grew steadily from the early 1980s. They were around 36 per cent when the honourable member for Ballarat's party left office and they reached their peak of 77.1 per cent in 1992. There was a slight decline in 1993 to 76.6 per cent and a sharper decline last year to 74.6 per cent.

         With the large number of alternative routes to employment now available to young people, year 12 retention rates do not provide a complete picture of where our young people are gaining relevant education and training. Certainly there is an improvement in the labour market. I imagine that the figures for February, which will be released at about this time, will show continuing growth in opportunities for young people—as they have in recent months. That is resulting in more young people taking up apprenticeships and other employment options. That trend is confirmed in figures showing apprenticeship commencements increasing from 26,800 in 1993 to 33,000 last year and a corresponding drop in the 15- to 19-year old unemployment rate.

         It is also true that fewer young people appear to be repeating year 12, responding to advice from the government, repeated by me on a number of occasions, that repeating year 12 is unlikely to produce the kind of improvement in results that some year 12 repeaters seem to be expecting. Fewer young people are repeating year 12; instead, they are taking up opportunities in TAFE and employment, as the government has been encouraging them to do. This has also had an effect on school retention.

         A technical factor which would be of interest to the honourable member for Ballarat is that more young people these days are choosing to study year 12 on a part-time rather than a full-time basis and those students are not counted by the ABS for retention purposes if they are studying part time. The patterns are interesting on a state by state basis. In Victoria, for example, between 1992 and 1994 retention fell by 3.8 per cent as opposed to a national fall of 2.5 per cent. As I mentioned yesterday, New South Wales has the lowest retention rate of any mainland state.

         This is a reasonable illustration of Liberal policy in action. This is a reasonable illustration of what would happen were the policies advanced by the honourable member for Ballarat put in action. As a result, in those two Liberal states you see that very poor performance. In his own state, his colleagues in state government having closed 271 government schools and sacked over 8,000 teachers, it is not surprising that one should see falls of the kind I have mentioned in school retention. It is reasonably difficult to expect young people to continue on at school if at the same time you are closing their schools.

         On the matter of supplementation, which the honourable member raised, it is true that the government considered this matter very carefully, as it well might, given that the index of average government school recurrent cost rose by 5.1 per cent in the most recent period. That required a considerable amount of money to supplement school funding, some $133 million this year. The government did consider its position very carefully because the original intention of the policy to index schools funding by average government school recurrent cost was intended to link quality improvements from the government sector to the flow of funds to schools in general and to the non-government sector in particular.

         A figure of 5.1 per cent at a time when inflation was very low at 1.7 per cent obviously provided food for thought for the government, particularly given that the most significant contributing factor to the 5.1 per cent increase in costs was a blow-out in Victoria. That was the year in which the Victorian government sacked those teachers and paid out around $180 million in redundancy payments. The Commonwealth found it fairly difficult to accept that an increase in expenditure that involved sacking teachers could be linked to a quality index, which was the point of the original policy. The Commonwealth took time to consider its position and it decided that the original undertaking would stand and, as a result, many schools in all sectors will this year get the benefit of that additional $133 million in supplementation.

         The honourable member for Ballarat spent some time on the government's decision to undertake a review of the new schools policy in the non-government sector.

It also provides us with the opportunity for a comprehensive review of a policy which is almost 10 years old.

         The review is certainly timely because the last 10 years have seen major changes in the school education environment. I have mentioned that year 12 retention rates have more than doubled, so the school population in the post-compulsory years is very different in 1995 from the position a decade ago. Schools these days are increasingly becoming providers of vocational education, information technology is also having its impact, and other interesting structural developments are appearing. For example, there are developments which promote links between the various sectors.

         I notice from his press release of Tuesday that the opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Ballarat, wants to scrap the new schools policy altogether. The opposition believes in providing funding for every new non-government school which opens, regardless of its prospects for future viability and regardless of its impact on existing schools in the region. One really has to question whether the position adopted by the opposition is a sensible use of education dollars, given that they are the same people who have accused this government from time to time of waste and duplication.

On a number of occasions I have criticised the honourable member for Ballarat and his predecessors for their lack of policy. On this occasion, I have to admit that I am wrong. They have a policy in this area. Their policy is that they will not have a policy. They want to abolish the new schools policy altogether. I hope the honourable member for Ballarat will make a submission to the inquiry if he feels so moved. Perhaps opposition members are finding it a little too hard.

         —These amendments relate to grants to the states. I need to bring the attention of the House to a matter that occurred yesterday and which should be of enormous concern to this House. It is in relation to a response from the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) to a question by the member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland). I will be interested to hear the minister's comments on what I am about to say. I assume he will follow with an apology to this House and to the Victorian government.

         In answer to the member for Macarthur's question yesterday about state funding in Victoria, the minister stated that Victoria's spending was well below the per student Australian average. The minister is obviously unaware of the difference between per capita and per student. To malign the Victorian government in the way he has done in relation to its spending was a total misrepresentation of the facts. The $538 that the minister referred to was indeed the standardised average, the per capita average, for Australia. It bore no relation to per student spending and therefore the minister's allegation that the Victorian government had reduced its per student funding to schools and was now at the bottom of the pile is totally incorrect and a gross misrepresentation of the true position.

         Let us look at the true situation in relation to per capita funding and use the minister's figure of $538. He was using it per student but it is a per capita figure. If we look at the true standardised figures we will see that Victoria is spending well above its standardised per capita amount, according to the Grants Commission. This matter was raised in the Victorian state parliament yesterday. I will read briefly from the speech, which states:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Essentially what the commission does is to establish a standardised expenditure for education for the various states. In doing that the commission takes into consideration a number of factors. So far as Victoria is concerned it takes into consideration, for example, that it is geographically smaller and more densely populated than other states and has fewer problems with remoteness and isolation, its established infrastructure and the age distribution of its population. On that basis the commission's report shows that Victoria's actual spending per capita is $511.18 and the commission's standardised expenditure for Victoria is $476.86.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a clear indication that, according to the Grants Commission, the Victorian government is spending more on education than the commission believes it should be. The minister misrepresented the position in this House yesterday. I hope he will apologise.

It is per capita standardised expenditure which is unrelated to per student expenditure. Either the minister was unaware of the difference between per capita and per student—in that case he has been badly advised—or he did it deliberately. I will not say he did it deliberately, because I am sure that is not the situation, but there is an apology due. The graph representing these figures shows that Victoria spends 7.3 per cent more on education, according to the Grants Commission, than it should be spending on education.

        It is totally unrelated to per student spending. It is per capita spending—not per student. The minister does not know the difference between per capita and per student. He has quite falsely used that $538 figure as per student spending. It is patently wrong. It is a standardised per capita figure, not a per student figure. I suggest the minister should go back and get briefed by these people sitting in the advisers' box who will tell him that it is per capita and not per student and that his use of that $538 is wrong—wrong, wrong, wrong.

         The minister does owe an apology because that was the basis for his attack on the education system and on spending in Victoria yesterday. It is clearly wrong. It is not per student, as he said; it is per capita. It is the standardised figure. If he looks at what the Grants Commission said about the Victorian standardised figure, $478 is the appropriate figure—$476.86—whereas actual spending on a standardised basis is $511.18, well above what the Grants Commission believed was appropriate education spending in Victoria.

It would be most unwise of him to implicate himself. I will give the minister some leeway and say that he did not deliberately mislead the House. It is quite clearly the relativity between per student spending, he says five years ago, and the position as it now stands. That $538 is per capita expenditure; it is not per student.

         Why does the minister not concede that the per capita spending in Victoria is well above the Grants Commission figure? Why does the minister not now concede that, indeed, the Victorian government's per student expenditure is not as he alleges—that is, at the bottom of the pile—but is very much as the state minister says: significantly ahead of the Australian average expenditure per pupil? I again invite the minister to apologise to the House.

         —in reply—This occasion marks the closure of the second reading debate on the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1994, and it follows the referral of the bill to the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities on 8 February of this year. The government thanks the members of the committee for producing a report on the bill in such a timely fashion. Together with the committee, the government acknowledges the efforts of all those who provided submissions to the committee or appeared before it. The committee report deals with a number of concerns about specific provisions which have been raised in the parliamentary debate on the bill or in submissions to the committee. I now table the government's response to the committee report.

         In these brief remarks, I will just mention two of the main issues arising from the report: the distinction between small and large proprietary companies, and the question of access to debenture registers. One of the key reforms in the bill is to reduce the financial reporting requirements of small proprietary companies. The bill makes the distinction between small and large companies for this purpose by using a three-part objective test which looks at assets, revenue and employees. The committee concluded that, on balance, it preferred the small and large test, as a basis for distinguishing between proprietary companies, to the reporting entity concept advanced by the accounting bodies.

         The committee recommended that serious consideration be given to two options: namely, that the employees criteria remain, or that the employees test be deleted from the bill and the test for a small or large proprietary company be on the proposed assets and turnover criteria alone. The current test in the bill is designed to achieve an approximate measure of the company's economic significance. It provides a measure of flexibility which enables the test to be targeted in a manner which seems to the government to be appropriate.

         If the bill were to be amended to rely on two criteria alone, it would become a less appropriate test of a company's economic significance and, accordingly, a less appropriate touchstone for the application of corporate financial reporting requirements. Having said that, I advise that the government has noted carefully the committee's comments on these criteria and will keep them under review. If the employees criteria proves to be inappropriate in practice, the government will certainly be prepared to re-examine the issue.

         The bill contains important new safeguards to protect the privacy of debenture holders and of other securities holders whose details are shown in registers. The committee provided a full opportunity for both the representatives of the Australian Finance Conference and members of the simplification task force to discuss the rules in the bill on debenture registers.

         The committee has not proposed any change to the new protections included in the bill. However, it has recommended that an additional provision should be inserted to give the ASC the same power of exemption as it presently has. The government acknowledges that there are points to be made—both for and against—providing additional restrictions on access to debenture registers, but it has decided to accept the committee's view that the ASC should be able to provide such restrictions as it might consider necessary.

         It is proposed to amend the commencement provisions of schedule 6 by amending subsection 2(2) of the Corporations Legislation Amendment Act 1994. Schedule 6 will now commence on the day on which the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill receives royal assent. Because the bill contains a number of penalties which are expressed in terms of penalty units, the government considers it necessary to amend the Corporations Amendment Legislation Act in this way.

         —As we are considering all the amendments together, let me say that, in relation to the work that was undertaken by the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities on the Corporate Law Simplification Bill, the opposition believes that the work that has been done and the amendments that have resulted demonstrate the virtue of having the opportunity to examine important bills of this character. Matters of very real concern were raised by a number of members on this side of the House who have spoken on the bill. As I have said on a number of occasions, it is important to recognise that it is the Senate that has undoubtedly pioneered work in relation to deliberating on legislation.

         I think that there are more occasions on which the committees of the House ought to be used for such purposes. The government ought to facilitate and accommodate the reference of matters to committees of this House. It not only enhances the outcome but also ensures that there does not develop a view that the only people around this place who are able to add useful comments to and improve bills are senators.

         To go to the matter that we are discussing—the matter of the reporting entity test versus the test proposed in the bill—the distinction between small and large proprietary companies which will replace the current distinction between exempt and non-exempt companies was the subject of some public comment while the bill was being considered. The Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Australian Society of CPAs came out strongly in favour of the reporting entity test. On balance, the committee concluded that the test proposed in the bill should be adopted, as the reporting entity test does not provide a test of sufficient certainty. The committee was further advised that the distinction made by the bill reflects overseas practice and experience.

         There was a question as to whether the criteria proposed in the bill for distinguishing between small and large companies should be adopted in whole or in part. The test proposes that a company move from a small company to large company when it meets two of the following three criteria: more than 50 employees; gross operating revenue of more than $10 million; or assets of more than $5 million. The committee considered that tests of assets and turnover were more important than tests in relation to number of employees.

         While the committee was not able to reach an unqualified view on the test, and believes the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) should give serious consideration to whether the 50 employees criteria should be kept or should be deleted, leaving only the tests on assets and turnover, the government, in its response, indicated that it saw the present proposal as being sufficiently flexible to ensure that the test was targeted in a manner which, to the government, seemed to be appropriate.

         In relation to the other matters, the only important issue that I would like to advert to is the issue of having the register of debenture holders made public.

         I take this opportunity to briefly go through the formal response the Attorney-General has made and also the amendments. The committee looked at the distinction between small and large proprietary companies and came to the view that on balance the small-large test was a more appropriate and certain test than the reporting entity test, and resolved on balance that two of the three criteria in the bill ought to be adopted as a test. The Attorney-General has indicated that he proposes to stick with that provision which was the on-balance view of the committee.

I say that is good for small business and good for women because it will get over the age-old problem of the difficulty caused by active and passive directors and the issue of sexually transmitted debt, as it has become known, where more often than not the passive director is a spouse or a woman who takes no active involvement in the running of a company, simply signs the accounts, and if all goes wrong—as occasionally it does—is left saddled with the debts of the company. So this bill should avoid that occurring in the future and cut that problem off at source. The Attorney-General has indicated that he believes that change will be widely applauded by the small business community, as it should be.

         As far as the auditors of proprietary companies are concerned, another issue raised by the committee, the Attorney-General has indicated that he is pleased to ensure that the working party on simplification and audit gives this issue careful consideration. As far as the incorporation of the proposed small business guide into the bill is concerned, again the committee resolved on balance that that ought to remain part of the law as proposed by the bill. There were some reservations, but in this respect I am in the Attorney-General's camp. I think he is right in stating that legislators ought to be innovative from time to time, but I am also pleased to see that he has picked up the recommendation of the committee that because it is innovative it is an issue that ought to be reviewed, and he has certainly given that undertaking.

         The committee also dealt with the question of the ASC's power to require the preparation of financial reports by small companies. The Attorney-General has picked up this particular recommendation and indicated that he is raising it with the chairman of the ASC for a formal response. As chairman of the committee, I know that my personal attitude will not necessarily be shared by all members of the committee. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has made clear his view on whether proprietary companies ought to be able to be formed with one director, so I am sure the Attorney-General's response will not satisfy him, but as chairman of the committee it certainly satisfies me. I conclude where I started: I support the amendment; it is an eminently sensible response to an eminently sensible committee report and an eminently sensible bill, which will be good for the users of Corporations Law, good for small business and good for women.

My concerns relate to schedule 4, division 5A, subsection (2). This is one of the aspects of this bill that has received only general support. In fact, the committee's report says on page 17 at 2.37:

        I am disappointed and concerned that this section has not had greater consideration. The committee was advised by the corporate law simplification task force that, on the basis of statistics provided by the ASC, 98 per cent of proprietary companies would fall within the small category and that it would be only two per cent of Australian companies that might get caught out having to report when it is not necessary and having to do a full audit report at a high cost of somewhere between $10,000 to $30,000, according to the accounting profession.

         So this subclause which addresses the distinction between small and large proprietary companies callously disregards the one to two per cent of small and medium sized enterprises which will be disadvantaged by the introduction of this bill in the House today. I am disappointed about that. It is very easy for us to throw figures around like one and two per cent, but when we consider that there are almost 800,000 small businesses in this country that means that 10,000 to 15,000 businesses stand to be disadvantaged by the measure in this bill. That is not good enough. As far as I am concerned, it is a fairly cavalier approach. There is no reason for this to become a problem. There are other ways to deal with this issue. I think it does away with the whole spirit of what this bill is all about—that is, simplifying the Corporations Law. The reason we want to see simplification of corporation law and other laws in relation to small business is to reduce the cost for small business of doing business and improve the profitability of small business, and this simply does not address that issue.

         The committee stated in its findings, conclusions and recommendations, on page 33, paragraph 4.3, that the committee has been unable to reach an unqualified view. The members were not able to totally agree. I do not think that the committee fully appreciated or understood the impact that this might have and the fact that that one to two per cent translates into a very large number of small businesses and affects quite a number of people. One has to ask: who is responsible for law making in this country—the elected representatives of this place or the bureaucrats? While I appreciate that the bureaucrats make a powerful and very important contribution to the work of this House, ultimately we are the people's representatives and we are out there understanding day to day the difficulties that people confront as they go about their business.

         The flow-on effect of these tests will be to increase the complexity of the law for this group of people; to increase the amount of paperwork and financial reporting required, which no-one is going to be interested in; and to increase the cost to small businesses involved through the cost of unnecessary audit requirements. As I said, it could cost anything from $10,000 to $30,000. This will have the potential to needlessly increase small business costs by millions of dollars. That is not the aim of the corporate law simplification project.

         One of the other matters that I wanted to advert to briefly, which was picked up by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), was that of the single member companies as proposed under the bill.

As the government has given a guarantee that the working party will give full consideration to that issue, we welcome that undertaking.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Obviously, when we move from a system which is in place to a new system of distinguishing between large and small companies and the sorts of requirements we put on both, some companies which are now enjoying the status of being an exempt proprietary company will be picked up and deemed to be large. But the test does very much target companies in terms of their economic significance. If a company has two of the three requirements—50 employees, an annual turnover of $10 million, and assets of $5 million—it is a relatively large and important commercial concern. I do not know whether it is unreasonable for the community to expect a somewhat more stringent level of disclosure in terms of the financial position and activities of those companies than for the vast majority which will get very great benefit out of this bill.

         The figures have been put at 98 per cent to two per cent, so it is the vast majority who are getting a much greater benefit. That is why the bill has been very warmly received by the small business community, at least as far as the views that have been expressed to me are concerned. There will be a small number affected. I do not know whether it is the 15,000 figure. That would be 15,000 companies which probably have more than 50 employees, but they would have to have 50 employees plus meet one of the other two tests as well. So I think it would actually be a figure somewhat less than that.

         The other matter which the honourable member for Pearce raised was the reporting entity concept which the accounting bodies are very attached to and have been for some years and which they promote very strongly. In fairness, one has to say that the vast balance of views of people in this area—particularly the lawyers, in terms of the Law Council of Australia, and other advisers concerned with how these things can be made to work in a practical sense—is that the reporting entity concept is not a practical one to put into operation. If we are not now talking about a program, like it or not, the three criteria are at least fairly straightforward and simple and companies will know whether they fall within it or not. The reporting entity concept is a far vaguer concept and, though it has some attractions, in my view and, indeed, in the view of the committee, the proposed tests are the way to go.

We want to try to benefit, and get cost reductions for, business. We want innovative reforms that actually work. Therefore, we will watch this legislation very closely. If it is not working, if there are problems, if the thresholds are impacting on much larger numbers of companies in an adverse way, or if it is not in the public interest for the information to come out, we will change it. We are really trying to do a positive thing here.

The second stage will come out in a second bill in July. It will mean that, within probably another 18 months or so, the core provisions of the entire Corporations Law would have been rewritten.

I must say at the outset that I was surprised at the rather mean spirited remarks of the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), when he was responding on behalf of the opposition to the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott). The member for Goldstein seemed to think that there was something terrible in the fact that the government and the SMA had reconsidered the licensing fee that they were going to charge amateur radio operators. I will come back to that later in my contribution, but it is worth while putting on the record that the remarks were mean spirited. As members of parliament, rather than attacking the government for responding to people who make representations, we should be commending the government and the government agency, instead of telling them that we are starting to keep a closer eye on them for doing this.

         These amendments will make it easier for apparatus licensees to pay their licence fees. They will now be able to make those payments annually for an apparatus licence, in instalments if they wish, and licences can be issued for a period of up to five years.

         Formerly, a default in the payment of a licence fee—which was usually an up-front fee—would have resulted in the suspension or cancellation of a licence. There was no scope to allow a licensee a period of grace in the payment of the fees. Often, people who needed these licences as an integral and ongoing part of their business could have been deprived of them through falling on hard times and suffering cash flow problems.

         Those amendments to the bills are the result of a long and detailed public inquiry by the Spectrum Management Agency. In 1993, in response to a report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, chaired by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), the government directed the Spectrum Management Agency to inquire into the restructuring of licence fees for cost recovery. The Spectrum Management Agency released a public discussion paper, held extensive public seminars and consulted with the Wireless Institute of Australia and the Radiocommunications Consultative Council. Over 4,000 submissions were received, and the amendments before us today are among the many key recommendations to emerge from that inquiry.

         The SMA plans to begin issuing five-year licences from April this year in line with the commencement of the radcom licensing computer system. It should be emphasised that these bills are intended to give apparatus licensees a choice, and give them flexibility in the way that they obtain their licences.

         As the chairman of the caucus committee on transport and communications I have received representations expressing concern about some aspects of the SMA's draft proposal for the change to the fee structure. With a number of other government members—and also, I understand, some members of the opposition—I have made approaches to the government to have the proposed fee schedule re-examined. Rather than the mean spirited way in which the member for Goldstein addressed this, I would like to commend the Spectrum Management Agency and the parliamentary secretary, because I am pleased to see that the SMA has further considered the level of fees to be applied to amateurs in the light of the public benefit that amateurs provide to the community.

         A lower overall fee is now proposed by the SMA in view of the training and the experience in communications technology that amateurs provide to young people, and the role that amateurs provide in maintaining communication links in times of emergency. The SMA has quite rightly decided to reduce the tax component of the licence fee to the minimum level. This will reduce the fee from the proposed $71 to $51 per annum. The fee would be applied to all amateur licences. While $51 represents a small increase on fees paid for many years by amateurs, the new fee is based on the administration and maintenance services provided to this group by the SMA and includes the cost of issuing the licences, managing interference to their services, issuing and registering call signs, accrediting examinations, and representing amateurs' interests in the international negotiations that the government carries on from time to time. It also represents a reduction of $20 from the draft fee which was proposed prior to the most recent round of consultations.

         While there are social benefits of amateur radio, the fee set at $51 represents more than fair value for their access to and ongoing use of large amounts of radio frequency spectrum.

The fee structure proposal is just one of the results of the inquiry that the SMA conducted for all users of the radio frequency spectrum, not just amateur radio users. The government's objective is to establish an efficient and equitable means of managing this vital national resource. It is a resource that all Australians ought to share in, through the licensing of the spectrum. The changes to apparatus licences are designed to reduce the number of categories of licences, and to provide for a more equitable distribution of the charges that are already made for the use of the spectrum.

         The proposals put forward by the Spectrum Management Agency suggest fees based on a combination of the costs of administration and the value of the part of the spectrum being used. This method of charging is in line with the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, in which both the government and the opposition participated.

         Up until now, as honourable members would know, fees and categories of licensed radiocommunication equipment have developed in an ad hoc fashion, over time, with little relationship between the fees charged for the spectrum used and the value of that spectrum. The cost to the Commonwealth of the administration and use of the public resource of the radio frequency spectrum should be reflected clearly in the pricing structure. That was one of the key findings of the public inquiry.

In broad terms, local governments and state governments could expect to benefit from the restructuring of the fees.

         It should be made clear that CB and amateur operators are utilising quite different services, which both the government and international organisations provide. The CB users occupy very limited amounts of the spectrum, and they do not require any sort of frequency coordination. They can cut across each other and no-one can complain. There is no responsibility carried by the Spectrum Management Agency for interference investigation within the two bands subject to CB licences. The Spectrum Management Agency's activities with regard to CB licences are confined to resolving interference by CB operators to other services, and investigating complaints of abusive or offensive language.

It is in the Oceania division that Australia sits for the purpose of management. And it is management that we are talking about here today. What has been introduced is a new scheme of management for the spectrum, a scheme of fees categorised by either a spectrum maintenance charge or a spectrum access tax.

         The interesting point to note here is that the spectrum access tax is more of a spectrum denial fee. Primary spectrum users deny spectrum to other users and thus the charge of this fee or tax. This is okay if there is an alternative user for the spectrum, but in the spectrum allocated to amateur users the Spectrum Management Agency has no say on its use other than for amateur radio. The use of the spectrum for amateur radio is fixed by international treaty and thus is binding on Australia. I could, of course, go on to make comment on this government's almost blind adherence to every treaty that has ever come into existence, but I will refrain from that.

As to these spectrums, many are fixed as exclusively amateur worldwide and are of no commercial value to Canberra. Most of the others are already assigned to commercial or government primary users and to amateurs as secondary. Once again, the SMA cannot vary the amateur usage because that is covered by international treaty.

Some CB operators use their stations and repeaters for business, while amateur radio operators are forbidden to do so by law. The licence fee for CB operators has been abolished.

I remind the government that licence by regulation would prohibit amateur radio operators having a profit. So how could taxing it be right? Tax on the use of radio spectrum, which is already set aside by international convention for amateur radio, does not occur in any other country. So it is completely unfair, unjust and flies in the face of practice in other countries. From what I hear, we are already something of a laughing stock in the international communities in which amateur radio communicates. No other country in the world levies such a tax on their amateur radio operators.

         Is the government really aware of the size of the group it wants to antagonise by the introduction of this tax and the powerful communication facility they have available to communicate a message about the lack of mandate this government has to tax them? Currently, there are about 18,000 amateur radio operators and, internationally, their numbers are measured in millions—a huge communication network. They have powerful radiocommunications at their disposal—they talk a lot. As I said, already international reaction is not favourable on this government's intent to tax them. This particular aspect of this legislation has been grossly ill-considered.

         Again, because amateur radio operators are a registered minority, they are an easy target. I refer again to Mr Milne's letter where he asks for my support to see what I can do about ensuring that these increases are not imposed. In his letter he says:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        I require your support towards action to have the proposed fees rescinded and another more suitable approach taken.

       </para>
       <para>
        I assure Mr Milne that I do oppose this unjust form of tax. The government ought not hide behind its statement that this legislation is all about a positive gesture of allowing greater flexibility in the payment of radio licence charges. I recognise and support professional and large radio licence operators having their fees reduced by taking up payment options. My particular objection is that I consider amateur radio operators an important group of Australians who have a function to fulfil.

         The package was developed as a result of public inquiry which was initiated as far back as December 1993 at the direction of the government. This package aims to respond to industry requirements resulting from that inquiry into that more flexible arrangement, so I support that aspect. The new payment options introduced by the package coincide with a whole new licensing computing system and will therefore provide a much clearer and easier administration.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          At least that part seems to meet some of the aspirations of the industry. But nowhere in the legislation or in reading the background information do I find any justification for the `punitive' attitudes towards amateur radio operators. I do not think they ought be used to subsidise some of the gains that might be achieved for other licensed operators.

They are simply taxes and they cost Australians, and we are opposed to that.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to contribute to this debate on the Radiocommunications (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendment Bill 1994 and cognate bills. I was very disappointed to hear the comments of the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) who, I know, is concerned about all issues that may impact on his constituents. I believe he is not presenting the full facts. I dare say that the criticism in relation to this bill goes back to 18 January when the shadow minister for communications and the arts, Senator Alston, took up this issue in a press release. He said:

        And it goes on and on. While we all recognise the contribution made to the community by amateur radio hams, the opposition spokesperson failed to indicate that he had any idea of what was in the report of the Spectrum Management Agency. He said that it indicated that there had been no consultation. The facts are at variance with that statement. Indeed, if the member for Mallee had cared to look at the information, he would have been able to clarify the situation.

         On 8 December 1993 the then communications minister, the present Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), instituted the inquiry. Throughout January and February 1994, the SMA distributed over 4,000 copies of the discussion paper to interested parties, advertised widely and then proceeded to conduct 14 public seminars attended by over 900 people. It received 422 submissions and reported its findings to the then Minister for Communications and the Arts, the present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), at the end of May 1994.

         The report includes a number of recommendations. In relation to citizens band licences, there was a recommendation, adopted in October 1994, for class licences. Other recommendations include: the simplification of apparatus licence categories; arrangement for licence terms up to five years with very flexible payment arrangements—one of the key factors in the bills we are debating; the possibility of transferring apparatus licences between parties; and, very importantly, licence fee concessions for volunteer non-profit emergency organisations, such as rural firefighters, search and rescue organisations, coastguards, surf lifesavers and ambulance services in remote areas. Then there was a definite decision to charge for a range of services provided by the Spectrum Management Agency. Those charges are to be introduced on an equitable and transparent basis so that people can understand what the charges are for and why they are paying them.

The shadow minister is the person who would like to be running this area of the government. This is a wide ranging report which has a number of very positive reforms for the use of the spectrum.

         While the amateurs were paying limited fees for the services they received, other essential services were paying much greater charges. One of the key benefits in these reforms is that a lot of these essential services will have a decrease in charges. That is a very sensible rationalisation. I refer to the editorial by Jim Rowe in the March 1995 edition of
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Electronics Australia

        He goes on to say that there will be increasingly fierce competition for space in the electromagnetic spectrum. He says:

        In many ways this is a finite resource, and historically amateurs have accumulated quite a lot of spectrum `real estate'. In fact I understand that in Australia, amateurs are second only to the Department of Defence in terms of their total allocation of spectrum space.

        The SMA has sought to base them clearly on the real costs of issuing and renewing licences, and also on managing each licensee's activities—together with a `spectrum access cost' or tax, based on the perceived value of the spectrum segment(s) being used on an exclusive basis. On the whole this seems reasonable, and is in fact the kind of changes taking place in many other countries as well.

It is a considerable investment for people who choose to become involved or interested in this area or hobby. Therefore, a charge of $51, or even $70, would not seem to me to be a major impost.

         If we look at the suggested reforms to licensing types, we see very clearly that this report has done a very good job. It has done a very good job because there has been, as I said before, this wide ranging consultation. There was a commitment that this consultation would continue in relation to a range of issues, including the cost to amateurs. Page 5 of the SMA discussion paper suggested that the licence types should be:

        In fact, it came up with a grouping of 16 new transmitter licence types with three new receiver licence types which would be based on definitions in the Australian spectrum plan. I just want to go through those briefly to indicate the breadth of areas we are talking about. The first area is aeronautical. The second area is aircraft. The third area is amateur, and within amateur are several subgroupings: unrestricted, limited, novice, intermediate, novice limited, amateur beacon and amateur repeater. They are allocated a proposed differing amount. The fourth area is broadcasting, which includes broadcast service and narrowband area service. The other areas are defence; earth; fixed; land mobile; maritime coast; maritime ship; multipoint distribution station, MDS; outpost; public telecommunications service; radiodetermination; scientific; and space.

         Some concerns were put to me about the fact that citizens band radio holders had been provided with a class licence. But, from information given to me, it is clear that the CB bands—although they appear to very numerous—occupy a relatively small part of the spectrum and do not require the sort of regulation or representation the SMA has made on behalf of the Wireless Institute of Australia in terms of the accreditation of their examinations and international representations.

         Although it would appear to individual amateur radio operators on the ground that the Spectrum Management Agency does little for them, a great deal is done on behalf of this group of people—which is about 20,000 across the country. However, this means that about 30 per cent of licensees would experience fee increases—this is where the amateur licence holders are found. Local government authorities, state governments and the emergency service organisations will benefit considerably, as will organisations such as taxi operators and paging services—those small businesses about which the opposition claims to be very concerned. Although I can understand the concerns of amateurs in terms of the CB network, the facts really speak for themselves.

So there are 20,000 amateurs with 179 times more spectrum than the estimated 800,000 CB operators. Each amateur uses significantly more power than CB users. As I said before, amateurs occupy more spectrum than most others, except the Department of Defence, which I think we would all agree would require a fair degree of spectrum.

         During 1994 a review of radiocommunications apparatus licensing was conducted by Spectrum Management Agency. One of the recommendations arising from that review was that a wider variety of payment options be made available, particularly to avoid the necessity for regular annual licence tax payments when the term of the licence exceeds one year. On the surface, it is a very commendable market driven recommendation. However, I wonder how many members of this House are aware of other activities of the Spectrum Management Agency that make the implication of a wider variety of tax payment options almost a necessity for many of Australia's 18,115 amateur radio licence holders. For these clients of the Spectrum Management Agency, the amendments contained in the radiocommunications bills are, unfortunately, timely. These individuals are faced with the spectre of a new tax on their access to the radio frequency spectrum.

Yesterday the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), came into this House and subsequently, in yet another about-face by the government, announced more policy on the run. Amateur radio operators are now faced with a total annual fee of $51, a 38 per cent or $14 increase on the current $37 fee.

It is good to see the public getting involved and applying pressure to make appropriate changes.

Item 2 of the schedule of the Radiocommunications (Receiver Licence Tax) Amendment Bill 1994 inserts proposed new section 6, which gives applicants for receiver licences issued for periods of more than 12 months different options in relation to the payment of the tax. This is all well and good, but it does not address the concerns of those individuals who hold amateur radio licences. They are in many instances young or elderly members of the community. They may be retired war veterans or simply individuals participating in a very worthwhile hobby. Perhaps they belong to the many hundreds of scout and guide groups around Australia.

         On the government's way to the new tax market, a funny thing has happened. The government has decided that the commercial interests associated with CB operators, and the millions of dollars forgone in licence revenue from that market, are somehow made up for by the easy pickings of the amateur radio sector. This is the sort of inequity the community has come to expect from this government. For amateur radio operators, the SMA's new tax payment options contained in the bill are not the only issues foremost in their mind. They are really concerned about whether or not they will be able to continue to afford to hold amateur radio licences at all.

The remainder are at least 37 per cent lower, and some of them are as much as 66 per cent lower. What responsible authority would impose such an inequity on a community good?

         As indicated yesterday, the government has been caught out. It has been exposed. The SMA's lame duck excuse that this last minute about-face is the result of further consultation and consideration is simply perpetuating the myth that the SMA is concerned about amateur radio. Its actions clearly reveal otherwise. This is the action of a mean-spirited government that is surreptitiously eroding the quality of life for many Australians. In fact, I think it is called robbing Peter, who is the community, to pay for the excesses of Paul, who is the part-time Prime Minister.

         The SMA's 273 per cent tax would have raised approximately $550,000 from a community sector that contributes hundreds of hours every year—worth hundreds of thousands of dollars—to a voluntary and free community service. The great bulk of this service just happens to be provided during times of crisis in the community and at a time when other traditional and commercial lines of communication are often not functioning. In many other countries this service is not taxed at all. In the United States, Congress has recognised the importance of amateur radio and, consequently, no licences and no taxes are paid by amateur radio operators. But this is not so in Australia. This government's concept of the clever country is to impose a 273 per cent tax on the activities of our scouts, our guides and committed radio enthusiasts, who have repeatedly demonstrated excellence and commitment to the use and development of amateur radio in Australia and overseas.

         It must also be emphasised that the amateur radio community operates in true amateur spirit. Unlike other users of the radio frequency spectrum, amateur radio licensees are prohibited from gaining any pecuniary interest from their activities. This government is using amateur radio. Perhaps it could be suggested that the government is blatantly exploiting the goodwill and the commitment of this sector of the community and, in the process, is determined to squeeze every bit of financial gain possible from it.

         A very clear comparison of the government's commitment to the community is evident when one looks at the discriminatory way amateur radio users are treated as compared with the way users of citizens band frequencies are treated. CB users have had their licence requirements abolished. That is a windfall of approximately $6.5 million to users of the radio frequency spectrum. It must be noted that the CB users are often commercial operators who do gain financially from their investments. As I said before, as the shadow minister for small business, I am the last one who wants to see any additional costs imposed, but I believe this particular measure is inequitable.

         Concern has been expressed that a misinformation campaign has been embarked upon to cloud the waters of change.

Most governments around the world do, although there are some that don't.

         At a recent presentation the SMA identified its revenue estimates for 1995-96. Depending on your point of view it is either interesting or disturbing information. From the point of view of amateur radio operators it is a disgusting example of blatant tax grab. Based on the following figures, I would have to agree. The SMA's revenue forecasts are: 17 per cent from spectrum maintenance charge; three per cent from licence renewal charges; 14 per cent from licence issue charges; two per cent from consultancies; and—wait for it—64 per cent or $60.6 million from spectrum access tax.

         The figures indicate beyond any doubt that the primary activity of the SMA is as a tax gathering front for the government. Unfortunately the amateur radio community is deemed to be a soft touch. The SMA, in its publication titled

       <para font-size="-=2">
        As noted earlier, all fees are in fact taxes levied under the Tax Acts. The basis for imposing a spectrum access tax on users, above the costs of spectrum management is that the spectrum is a valuable resource and the community is entitled to a monetary return—or a rent—for its private use. A direct monetary return, via government, is intended to compensate the community for the user benefiting from access to spectrum. It is also a rationing device.
       </para>
       <para>
        In respect of amateur radio, the SMA should practice what it preaches when it refers to valuable resource. In February 1995, the SMA stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

        The SMA should remember those sentiments and then reconsider its bizarre treatment of this very valuable community resource. The SMA should also listen to others in the community who have commented on the value of the amateur radio network. I would recommend that those on the other side of the House also take note—wherever they are today. In October 1992, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), addressed the SEANET convention in Darwin. He said:

I feel that there is a lot of merit in their argument. I have discussed this with members on my side of the House and I have put my concerns, as others have done, to the minister.

         The opposition can try the kinds of scare tactics which the honourable member for Ballarat has attempted this afternoon and I would admit that, certainly, their new leader has a capacity to scare people to an extent greater than his predecessors. They can try to frighten parents and students, but I know and the public knows—they know you; they have got you taped—you for the phonies that you are.

         —Today's labour force figures are indisputable evidence that the government's job strategy not only is on target but has well exceeded it. Today, with the figures that were released, we have smashed through the 500,000 jobs pledge that was made at the time of the last election. Do you remember the 500,000 target—the one that those opposite said we could not achieve? Not only have we exceeded it and taken it to close to 560,000, we have done it in two-thirds of the time. It did not take three years; it took two.

         What was also demonstrated in the labour force figures today was a significant increase in the participation rate, and that had the effect, as most members would be aware, of seeing only a smaller drop in the unemployment rate. It went from 9 per cent to 8.9 per cent. The female participation rate is now at its highest level ever recorded, and the total participation rate is almost at the record high level.

         This demonstrates that we are a government that was able not only to deliver the jobs but also to open up the opportunity to those jobs—to recognise that it is important not just to make jobs available but to expand the labour force at the same time. Our ability to expand the labour force takes away the inflationary pressure that would otherwise come from these very strong job growth figures.

         I might make, by way of observation, this point: if we had the participation rate that those on the other side left us with in 1983, do you know what the unemployment rate today would be? It would be 3.8 per cent. This is the sort of golden age of full employment that those on the other side want to hark back to in terms of reminding us of the Menzies era. The problem with the Menzies era was that it was full employment only for men. It was only men who were able to participate fully in the opportunities that were provided. The Liberals had no strategy for opening up the opportunity for encouraging women, in particular, to enter the work force.

         What did we have the new Leader of the Opposition say in terms of his election to that position, as far back as 1 February? What he said then was that the whole economy had gone dark again. Then, on 8 February, he said that the sky had fallen in again. Then the shadow finance minister, who must have been getting a bit confused about the breaking of the drought, said that the clouds of the next recession were looming—they had not occurred; they were looming. Then we had John Howard at a doorstop on 15 February saying that the sky was starting to fall in again. But, on 17 February, he said that the sky had fallen in again. In case you missed all of that, Mr Speaker, he said on 8 March, in opening the campaign for the candidate of the Liberal Party in the Canberra election, the sky was starting to fall in again.

         Can anyone really suggest that the sky is falling in again on the basis of the 560,000 jobs that have been created?

         —I thank the member for Bonython for his question. Certainly, I think the employment figures that have been announced today and referred to by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training in his earlier question are a tremendous outcome for the nation. A growth of 560,000 additional jobs in two years since the last election is a phenomenal performance—an absolutely phenomenal performance. And it is the envy, I might say, of most other Western countries who could not remotely think of achieving that kind of outcome.

         This is an outcome which is phenomenal for Australia. I might say though that these seasonal adjustment factors do tend to produce some lumpy outcomes—we see spurts and we see a slowdown the next month; it is not an even progression. So just because we have this big spurt of 75,000 additional jobs in this month has not meant that we have changed our view about the employment outcome for this financial year.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         When I announced the mid-term review a little over a month ago, I said that we expected the employment outcome for this year to be a 3 3/4per cent increase, up from three per cent in the budget. And today's figure does not really lead us to change that estimate but more or less confirms that we are growing very solidly indeed and that the budget estimates were too low.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Other countries, as I have said, would certainly look with envy on such growth in employment. If you look at the other OECD countries, you see, generally, rates of increase in employment which are far less than we are experiencing. For 1994, the OECD estimates that  3/4 for all of its member countries, the growth in employment will be 0.7 per cent—0.7 per cent. This against a background where in our last 12 months, we have just chalked up 4.4 per cent, and for the whole year our estimate was 3 3/4 per cent. So we are growing around four per cent and Western countries generally are doing less than one per cent growth in employment.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         So, quite clearly, our performance on employment growth is extraordinarily good by comparison with other Western countries. Even for 1995 where it is generally expected that employment outcomes will be better in Western countries generally, the OECD estimate for that year at the moment is 1.3 per cent compared to our figures approaching four per cent. Quite clearly, we are doing extremely well on employment growth in comparison with other countries.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         But, Mr Speaker, if you look at the comparison with our past, you see also just how good that growth picture is. Since this government was elected just over 12 years ago, employment has increased by 1,865,000 additional jobs. That is an average growth in employment of 155,000 jobs a year. That compares with an average rate of growth of employment when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer of this country, for the five years from 1977 up to 1982, of 52,000. That is 52,000 compared to our 155,000—approximately 100,000 less than we have achieved on average over the last 12 years.

I did put one condition on the licence which was issued to the ABC, and that was a requirement for certain levels of Australian content. Given that the ABC was the only one of the three licensees that received a licence without paying any funds to the taxpayer, and without having to go through an option process, I thought that the least we could do was impose certain minimum standards of Australian content on the two ABC channels.

         —The question goes to the links between employment and Australian families. It is a very important question because, as was pointed out by the Treasurer and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, alongside this incredible achievement of 560,000 jobs in two years we have an historically high level of participation rate. That historically high level of participation rate underlines the fact that during the 1980s and into the 1990s we saw quite fundamental social changes occurring in Australia; changes that will have quite profound effects on Australian families.

         It is very important in the context of this parliament because one of the things that divides us from those on the other side of the House is that members of the opposition tend to be more socially conservative. It is such social conservatism that often means that, in terms of debate about policy, those opposite are not able to grasp the meaning of statistics. What these figures actually mean is that levels of participation, as we suggested, if applied in 1983-84—

         —At that time we were talking about unemployment of around 3.8 per cent if we had today's levels of participation. In terms of the implications for the way that the social security system is structured, that meant that the social security system had to, in a sense, be turned outward towards the labour market. Many of the reforms that were carried out in the late 1980s in terms of the so-called active society model have now been proven, in this period of strong recovery, to be quite fundamental in assisting particularly women back into the work force.

         The reforms represented by the white paper together with a more incentive based social security system have meant that there were much stronger resources for people to enable them to get the training and the skill enhancement necessary. Again we have seen a quite marked impact, which again explains the rather faster achievement in employment growth than, for example, was achieved coming out of the 1983 recession.

         In the numbers today, we see evidence of a dramatic decrease in the number of married couple families who had an unemployed member. I point to one statistic that illustrates the success of a combination of policy. We have seen over the same 12-month period the number of sole parent families, arguably the group most disadvantaged, with employed members increase by 180,000. That is quite a massive improvement and that is what comes from the emphasis this government has placed on child care—253,000 places—and on programs like JET where 46,000 jobs for sole parents were created as a result of that program alone.

         I emphasise these points because, fundamentally, they are the difference between a government that has policy integrity and looks at the interrelationship between different elements of policy and an opposition that is increasingly negative, increasingly cynical, fundamentally opportunistic and could never achieve reforms of the dimension that this government has achieved. That is why—let me go to the OECD, and I have been and chaired conferences in the OECD—Australia, comparatively speaking, does better in these areas than any other country in the OECD.

         We do well because there is integrity in terms of our policy, because there are links across different elements of policy and because, fundamentally, the government recognises that the issue of employment—the Leader of the Opposition speaks about it almost casually, with no substance, and says it is important—is important. The government has demonstrated in the 560,000 jobs it has created in two years—this is more than rhetoric; this is substance—that these are outcomes that illustrate how effectively we have worked in this very important area.

I made it clear how she had worked in a tag team, in collaboration with the member for Barker, and how they had both known when the matters were raised in the parliament that the documents to be tabled here were going to cause such suffering to Aboriginal women.

        The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has never been the same since Mr Kerry Packer went on television and made certain statements. Mr Packer was asked about the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), and he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        He's been around for a long time. I think he's a decent man. I think he's an honest man and I think he's a man who has seen the mistakes made and I don't think he will make them again.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was an objective statement of an observer of Australian politics. All Mr Packer said in that statement was what the rest of Australia already knew; that the Leader of the Opposition is a decent man and that the Leader of the Opposition is an honest man. But that statement of what the whole of Australia knew drew the Prime Minister into a fury. The Prime Minister came back and made a statement that no-one else in Australia knew. He made an allegation that he knew something the rest of Australia did not.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         He alleged, in a calculated, specific, dishonest and deceitful allegation, that this statement was made because a secret deal existed between the Leader of the Opposition and Mr Packer. It was a calculated, specific, dishonest and deceitful allegation. The Prime Minister, after failing to detail his allegations to this House, after having the opportunity to come into this House and submit himself to questioning, hopped on a jet and hotfooted it over to Singapore. It was no accident that in Singapore he returned to the theme. As Laurie Oakes reports in this week's
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Bulletin
         </emphasis>
         , there he was, down the back of the plane, trying to incite the journalists to write this up. There he was, down the back of the plane, engaging in smear, innuendo, falsehood and lies. He knew that it was false. He knew that he could not substantiate it. He had, cowardly, not come into this House and made the allegations; he went down the back of the plane and tried to seed them in the journalists' minds. Mr Keating claimed to those journalists, as reported by Laurie Oakes in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Bulletin
         </emphasis>
         :
        </tab>

        . . . he's told the Packer camp and the Packer camp have told me.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was the allegation. He was not trying to base it, as the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) now is, on statements that were in the public domain. It was not enough for Mr Keating to say that the Leader of the Opposition had a genuine view about cross-media ownership. It was not enough to debate the merits, as you are now trying to do, little Sir Echo; be careful. He had to allege a conspiracy and he had to allege a first-hand witness to that conspiracy.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Little Sir Echo did not take long to take up the chant: `War is peace; black is white; the Prime Minister is always right.' But the trouble was that the Prime Minister was in a different time zone. So as the chant came from the Prime Minister and was echoed back in Australia, it became increasingly out of date. I wonder how he felt, after he said that, yes, there was a senior executive in the Packer camp who had given this information to the Prime Minister, when he woke up on Wednesday, 8 March, 1995 and read the headline on the front page of the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian
         </emphasis>
         : `Richardson denies Packer, Howard deal'. I wonder how he felt when the godfather of his own faction, former senator Graham Richardson, walked away from him? I wonder how he felt when Peter Barron, the great strategist of the Labor Party, walked away from him? I wonder how he felt when the senior executives denied the substance of this claim? I wonder how he felt when Mr Packer denied the substance of the claim? I know how he felt when the Leader of the Opposition denied the substance of the claim: he felt caught, and he was.

         To believe this minister, Mr Packer is a liar, the Leader of the Opposition is a liar, Mr Barron is a liar, former senator Graham Richardson is a liar, and the only person who tells the truth is Paul Keating. That is the substance of his position: Mr Packer is a liar; the Leader of the Opposition is a liar; Mr Barron is a liar; former senator Graham Richardson is a liar; and the only person who tells the truth is the Prime Minister. Well, who would want to be in a situation like that? And he knows it is false. He knows this was a smear which he himself walked into. If I were the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), I would be briefing him overtime right now. Send him back; make sure that you give him all the lines. People sometimes have to realise in life that they are not up to it, and this minister is one such person. It should be remembered that before he was appointed to the position of minister for communications he had that moment of self-realisation. He said, `I don't know that I'm up to it.' He said, `I don't know that I'm up to making tough decisions.' He said, `I'm not sure I have demonstrated yet that I'm good enough to be a minister handling difficult issues.' Let me tell you, old son: we're sure. We're absolutely sure that you have not demonstrated that you are a minister that can handle difficult issues.

         Before I move off his second role as minister for the arts, I just want to draw the attention of the House to the report of the Australian Children's Television Foundation for 1993-94. On the front cover is a group of children. One of them is wearing a fireman's hat. The one that is wearing the fireman's hat in fact is fireman Lee. It looks very much like the minister. Do you know what I think? I think that the other children are saying to him, `What do you want to be when you grow up?'

         —The tragic thing is that the only thing he wanted to be when he grew up was a fireman, but Paul Keating made him minister for communications. That is the tragic thing. After all of the damage that you have done and all of the damage that you have attempted to do to the Leader of the Opposition, there is an opportunity for you to show your mettle. There is an opportunity for you to come in here and prove that you are up to ministerial office. There is an opportunity for you to show that you can be a minister. Sure, you may never be more than a mediocre, middle-of-the-road minister, but you could get there if you admitted the truth. All you have to say is, `There was no deal.' Each one of your statements has made it clear that you have no evidence. All you have to do is say, `I did not have the evidence.' All you have to do is say, `I have no information.' All you have to do is say, `I dug myself in because I was trying to defend the Prime Minister in relation to an unfounded allegation, and I apologise.' All you have to do is say, `I will from now on make my own judgments, be my own minister, be my own man and deal with policy.' But, if you fail to do that, if even at this late hour you cannot do that, then the facts are clear: you cannot be trusted with a sensitive portfolio. You cannot be trusted to deal with the precise evidence that is required in that position. You cannot be trusted to deal with the nuances, fineness and technicalities of that portfolio and you are not up to the job of minister for communications. That is the tragedy for Australia.

I was mowing my lawn one Saturday afternoon when my wife said, `Mr Laurie Oakes is on the phone.' I got on the phone and Mr Oakes said, `I have just had a request from the Prime Minister who wants to knock you off the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

He made an announcement not in relation to the Leader of the Opposition, the state of the economy, the current account deficit, rising interest rates, the plight of home buyers or the gap between the rich and the poor. None of those things were on his mind. The only thing that was on his mind was this intense hatred that he has when people disagree with him.

         But it is more than that. This is not just about Kerry Packer; this is a determined effort by the Prime Minister to send a message to the businesses of Australia that anybody who dares to criticise him can expect government retribution. That is the bottom line of this campaign. If you are a big businessman like Kerry Packer you might be able to look after yourself, but if you are not, if you dare to stand up, if you dare to make some honest comments, if you dare to say `The emperor has no clothes', he says, `I will turn the full forces of my lie machine back on to you.' That is the bottom line of this campaign. That is the campaign of the merchant of venom who, for 12 years, has been practising smear, innuendo and lie.

He is comparing Mr Packer to Murray Farquhar. It was not even the worst scam of Murray Farquhar. That might have been a bad scam of Murray Farquhar, but he was involved in one which was much worse. You know what it was too. Murray Farquhar's greatest scam was not trying to take gold bars out of the Philippines; Murray Farquhar's greatest scam was in August 1975 discharging one Laurie Brereton on bribery and conspiracy charges. That was his greatest scam. I can imagine Laurie Brereton when he came up over bribery charges on the Botany council and they said to him, `Murray's got the case. Wasn't that a lucky deal?' Murray Farquhar got the case, and that was the outcome in 1975.

         He is not alone in that because when the current Leader of the Opposition was Malcolm Fraser's Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, he was the person responsible for watering down the Trade Practices Act. He was the person responsible for lowering the test from a substantial lessening of competition to dominance. And this is the pair, the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who did all they could to make sure that we had weak anti-monopolistic laws for the Trade Practices Commission. Yet he had the hide to go on the

        So the proposal which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition are putting forward—that we can repeal the cross-media ownership laws and rely only on the Trade Practices Act, is a signal to Mr Packer, saying that the opposition believes that Mr Packer can own Channel 9 and the Fairfax newspapers as well.

         The Deputy Leader of the Opposition claims that there were very highly specific allegations made by me. I would like to remind the House of what I actually said on Monday. I said that I was aware of information that I believed linked the Leader of the Opposition to the allegations which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has put forward. At question time I said that that information came from the Packer camp and that I was told by them—that is, the Packer camp—that the Liberal Party had indicated that it would be prepared to support them and, if elected to government, would remove the cross-media ownership laws.

If the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Alston are ringing Mr Packer's executives and telling them they would be prepared to support a relaxation of the rules, we think the public of Australia have a right to know that.

         We now come to looking at whether the Leader of the Opposition's claims have been consistent. In his contribution here today, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition claimed that the views of the Leader of the Opposition have been genuinely held. They were genuinely held in 1987 when he told us that he thought the rules were unworkable; they were genuinely held when he said today that he thinks the cross-media ownership rules should be abolished. But we do not understand the doughnut in the middle—the petition he signed in 1991, where he said he was in favour of restricting Mr Packer from buying Fairfax. That is the thing we find difficult to understand.

         On this side of the House we make it clear that we think the cross-media ownership rules carry out a very essential role in broadcasting policy. Given Senator Alston's stream of consciousness, it is not hard to find one or two press releases and comments from him saying that he supports a tightening of the rules, abolishing the rules, and a review of the rules. In fact, Senator Alston has put out so many press releases and given so many interviews on this issue that it is not hard to find him supporting every possible position that has been advocated.

It was the Prime Minister of Australia who told the former editorial manager, Max Suich, of the Fairfax media empire in the late 1980s how much he hated the Fairfax newspapers and how much he was bent on destroying them.

         We all remember that very accurate report of a cabinet meeting in the mid-1980s when the then Prime Minister of Australia, Bob Hawke, supported by the now Prime Minister, Paul Keating, was trying to get the media laws of this country changed. Nobody could quite understand what their end game was because there seemed to be no rhyme or reason or logic in what they were trying to do. In the middle of it, with that great capacity for spotting humbug and isolating what somebody was up to, John Button said, `Hey, Bob, will you tell us which of your media mates you are trying to help so we'll know what you want us to do?' That was very well documented.

         The only two people on the government side who emerged with any merit or credit from that were John Button and the soon to be retiring member for Holt, Michael Duffy. At least they showed a little bit of intestinal fortitude, integrity and honesty. Both of them were appalled at the tawdry actions of your former Prime Minister and your current Prime Minister—the man you desire to serve on all occasions.

To use that great Australian expression, why don't you put up or shut up?

You have been blown out of the water. One thing surprised me about the Prime Minister; that is, I never thought he would blink. When it actually came to making an allegation, I never thought he would walk away from it. I was really amazed to get a long distance blink from the Prime Minister.

         —When the Leader of the Opposition spoke in this debate, he discussed cross-media ownership rules, foreign ownership rules and media policy generally. Throughout his speech, he failed to refer to not only current opposition policies but past opposition policies. After hearing the Leader of the Opposition debate the issues that surrounded the decisions last decade—changes to the ownership rules to separate ownership of the electronic media from ownership of the print media—a reasonable person would think that his remarks indicate that the opposition stood in diametrical opposition to us on those particular propositions.

         They supported us. They supported us on changes we put in place at the time. They merely said that they had some vague concerns about them, but their concerns did not go to the opportunity to establish a network in television—which was the basic element of the electronic media one, apart from the cross-media ownership rules at the time. They did not oppose that proposition. In so far as they had any difficulties with it at all, they had difficulties with whether or not you could move from owning one or two stations in major metropolitan centres around the country to owning any number of them. Then they had doubts as to whether you ought to be excluded from the print media in those centres at the same time. That was the area of their doubt.

         So, if you listened to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition, you would think that he stood here as a devotee of diversity. You would think that the government had somehow failed in its task to ensure diversity, and that that was the reason the government—among others—should be censured for its longstanding media policies in this area. That happens not to be true. The only thing consistent about the Leader of the Opposition when it comes to these matters is his vagueness. He has been vague when he was taken to task by the press on what his policies now happen to be. He was vague then. The media release he re-released earlier this week is such a typical opposition presentation on media policy that it is worth recounting. The style of presentation has not changed over the years. The basic thrust is, `For God's sake, do not force us to commit ourselves in any detailed fashion on anything related to media policy. Please let us stand around the place, shouting out that the government's policy is a mess but, for God's sake, do not tie us down.' The Leader of the Opposition said:

He hates a reference to history when it is a reference to history that deals with himself. He loves a reference to history when he thinks it makes a point about the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). That is the first point that you would make about the Leader of the Opposition. Then he said:

        There is an interesting fact in the 1991 document—which I will get to a bit later—about a petition he signed adopting a policy that he said he had never espoused. That petition, even though it was a matter of debate at the time, contains no reference to foreign ownership.

         There is a specific reason why it contains no mention of foreign ownership. That was that whilst there was a substantial amount of bipartisan unity, I have to say, having been on the receiving end of a lobbying about it as a minister in the portfolio at the time, on defending the cross-media ownership rules that they previously opposed, there was no bipartisanship on the subject of foreign ownership.

It was a very interesting interview the other night on Ray Martin's show. In the same way as he should not have entered this debate, he ought not to have gone on Ray Martin's show last night, because Ray Martin, who is a good interviewer, had the integrity to go through with him his 1991 position as opposed to his 1987 position, which was about as vague as you could have put it but did actually emerge at the end of the day as being one of opposition to cross-media ownership rules. So we will give him what he said back in 1987, even though by very tortuous logic he finally arrived at opposition to the ownership rules. Nevertheless, in 1991 he was absolutely clear cut.

        It is all right to sling around accusations about the Prime Minister, that he is a man without integrity and tells lies.

He will be prepared to mislead the public as to his point of view when he is not the spokesman on communications; when he is not the Leader of the Opposition; when he is a team player; and when he goes along with the opposition situation. We now know the price tag that is placed by the Leader of the Opposition on his personal integrity as far as that is concerned.

         One thing that is consistent about the opposition position is the slipping and the sliding. There has been a slipping and a sliding on this. The Leader of the Opposition says, `Oh, no, I do not have any particular deal in this situation. I go along and have a couple of chats. In the course of those couple of chats I reveal that I have informed Mr Packer that my position privately and publicly is that which it was back in 1987.' Smarm, smarm. He says, `It is no problem as far as I am concerned. I don't agree with the prince of print and the queen of screen and all the rest of it. I never have, except when he bid last time as part of the Tourang consortium in 1991 for Fairfax. Then I was opposed to it. So I do have something to explain. I just want to give you my assurance, Sir, that that little dereliction on my part was due to the fact that I wasn't Leader of the Opposition at the time; I was not the spokesman on communications. I went along as a team player. I went along with the opposition's situation. So please ignore that, Sir, and remember that back in 1987 I would have given you the lot. But please don't support me. Please don't get out there on your channels and say anything nice about me. No, please don't do that; just be absolutely clear that I have crawfished away from that terrible position that I took on the Tourang bid. I beg your forgiveness.

If those folk are around, we will apologise for past attitudes that we have taken on this matter which may have had cause to give grievous offence. And if those past attitudes are pointed out to us in a way that makes us look like we are a pack of liars, without integrity, as we slither into our hollows on this one, we will explain it by the fact that we had no official responsibilities at the time and we were just going along with the mob.'

It is true that politics has many of the characteristics of a game. It has the rough and tumble of a game. It has the theatre of a game. From time to time you have the professional free kick taken by one side, whilst breaking the rules, to still give their side a benefit. That is accepted when you are playing a game.

When you set out deliberately, maliciously and without justification to smear, when you set out to conspire with others—and, in particular, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)—to attack the reputation of another and impugn the integrity of a member of this House, doing so in a baseless and malicious way, you damage your own reputation. The Leader of the Opposition is not damaged by this; you are the one who is damaged by this. Sure, you are going to use your numbers and knock off our censure motion.

Minister, you have been brought up in a school of politics which thinks it is smart to run a smear campaign. You think that this is the way in which good public policy is conducted. The reality is that it ain't. It is a serious allegation. You work on the basis that mud sticks. Well, this is mud that ain't going to stick, Minister. This is a campaign we intend to and do repel.

         You, of course, act in conjunction with the Prime Minister, and he is a master of the smear campaign. You think that you can profit by it, but if you look at it you will see that what we have is a situation where the Prime Minister attempts to hold on to his office by the use of a smear campaign. In doing so, he demeans the office of Prime Minister. It is no wonder that there is a cynicism about Australian politics that has developed in the last 10 years when people like you and the Prime Minister act in the way you do—in a malevolent way.

        No talk, of course, about how many conversations he may or may not have had with him before he became Leader of the Opposition; but I will leave that to one side—we know what Senator Alston said in respect of that matter. Mr Martin goes on with a subsequent question:

       <para>
        And so it is! Mr Steketee goes on to outline the attitude that a former colleague of Mr Howard had about the honourable member for Bennelong:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Liberal's, Peter Shack, the former Liberal frontbencher, said of Howard ". . . he was hopeless in the shadow cabinet because, as chairman, he wanted to do most of the talking".
       </para>
       <para>
        We wish he would adopt the same approach in the House. We wish he would come into the House and say yes or no. We wish he would adopt the same style that he has in chairing shadow cabinet and come into the House or go onto the Ray Martin show and resolve this matter once and for all—yes or no. The reason he will not do it is that he has done a grubby deal. Mr Steketee concludes his article with the following:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . a second Howard leadership simply would endorse the point made by the first: that he looks better out of the leadership that in it.
       </para>
       <para>
        He has been convicted by his own silence. He ought to come into this House and deny what he knows he cannot deny, because he knows, as a member of this House for over 20 years, that the one thing you cannot do in this House is mislead it. He knows that he cannot come into this House and deny that he has done a grubby secret deal which rides roughshod over the media laws of this country and over decent policy so far as communications are concerned.

         —For the benefit of honourable members, I am very happy to speak in support of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and reject the amending censure aspect from the government. In so doing, I indicate that I will do so for some five minutes, followed by one member from the government side, and then we will vote on this matter. Let it be a vote on conscience. On that basis honest John Howard would win because the government talks about evidence, but what evidence has it produced? We have had the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) relying on Ray Martin's transcript. We have had the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) relying on Ray Martin's transcript. We have had the Minister for Finance and Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) relying on Ray Martin's transcript. Every question the government would want to put up was there in Ray Martin's transcript. Ray Martin's transcript could have been written by a member of the government, but he is too professional for that. Who does Ray Martin work for? He works for Channel 9. Who owns Channel 9? Kerry Packer.

         The government wants us to believe that Kerry Packer has done a deal to give John Howard an easy time. What nonsense! What humbug! Indeed, so much humbug that it cannot even get its amendment right on the censure. In all my days as a member of this House I have never before seen the Leader of the House come in here with all his bravado, put down a huge draft amendment, which was then moved by the Minister for Communications and the Arts, and suddenly have the Speaker knock 30 per cent of the amendment out of order. Gone. Thirty per cent of the case mounted by the government has been literally torn up by none other than the Speaker. I am very pleased about that.

         The accusations are flying thick and fast. However, as the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) correctly pointed out, there is one central core issue. It is: where is the evidence? If there is no evidence, there is no deal. Where are the actual documents supporting the matter? Where are the telephone transcripts? Where are the statutory declarations? If this case was worth one iota of serious consideration, surely, they would have been able to produce one statutory declaration from someone in the Packer camp. But they have been unable to do so.

         It is hard to believe that, because they have been unable to do so, they have actually defamed their former senatorial colleague Graham Richardson, they have actually defamed the former Labor Hawke operator Peter Barron and, in a sense, they have defamed none other than Mr Packer himself. I have no particular desire to support or defend any particular media owner or operator in this country. I have met most of them over the years and they are big enough to defend themselves.

         The truth is, and we come right back to the nub point, that if there is no evidence, there is no deal. That is where this case rests at the end of this parliamentary sitting week, with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gone mad in Germany, Singapore and in just about every other port—he even managed to get excited at a refuelling stop in Dubai—and a government unable to back up the case and the Minister for Communications and the Arts taking the wrong line in the process.

         There is one other question I, being a person of fair and good humour, thought could have been asked of the Minister for Communications and the Arts today in all the circumstances. Given the minister's detailed knowledge of conspiracy theories, including the so-called secret deal between Mr Kerry Packer and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), can the minister also reveal Harold Holt's current Chinese address? Can he also reveal who killed President Kennedy? And, for the sake of Triple J, can the minister tell us where Elvis Presley is currently located? That is how extraordinary your conspiracy theories are. They are a load of nonsense. We know they are a load of nonsense and the people of Australia know they are a load of nonsense.

There is no doubt that this has been a Goebbels type campaign by the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), and members of the front bench over there to turn themselves from hard Right ideologues into soft, furry, fuzzy, kind social democrats. But nobody believes you. You came into this House today and asked, `Where's your evidence?' We are guilty because we do not have the evidence that you have done a deal with Kerry Packer! What sort of logic is that? You have done the deal.

However, there has been a specific impact on the Albury-Wodonga area. This area is receiving the signal from Sydney for the period of the New South Wales elections. As a result of the time difference between New South Wales and Victoria, the rebroadcast of question time is now at 2.00 a.m. rather than 1.00 a.m.

          , my first purpose is to offer my congratulations for this report to the community affairs subcommittee chaired by the member for Brand (Ms Fatin). It is important to point out that she and her four colleagues on the subcommittee received 192 submissions, which indicates the level of interest in this issue around Australia. They held 12 days of public hearings. I took some time to attend one of those and certainly found it quite fascinating and, of course, of extreme importance.

          This inquiry follows a report tabled in August of last year on home and community care. In both cases, we found that the Australian community, both professionally and at a personal level, is very willing and very eager to respond to parliamentarians and the parliament when they are given the chance to. The high level of interest and open-mindedness that we find in these inquiries is most welcome. What also comes through is that as a country we have a very high level of skill. When we do something well, we do it very, very well, and we certainly rank amongst world leaders. But what seems to occur in breast cancer treatment, as in many other issues, is that we do not do it the same all over. Whilst we may do it well in one part of the country, we appear not to have learnt how to spread that best practice, that skill, across the whole country.

          As a nation Australia has long understood the tyranny of distance and the inequalities caused by our geographic dispersion, so I suppose many of us had thought that with modern communication technology and all those things we would have shrunk those differences and lessened them. What this inquiry shows is that women throughout Australia do get varying levels of treatment and service depending on where they live. That is a matter that I am sure is of concern to the parliament and to all of us. Yet at the same time the people offering the advice, and certainly the professionals, going on the evidence of the medical professions and the various individuals that took part, made very clear their willingness to actually participate in improving the system.

          I noted also some comments from the staff from the office of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), expressing some concern about the report. I think it is often wise for people to take time to read these reports and look at them closely and thoughtfully rather than succumb to the pressure of the media to respond at the moment they are released. We know what happens. The report comes out and the media scan it, look for a few controversial words here and there, and instantly look for a response. Most of us who have been around a while tend to recognise that that is the worst time to respond, and I have no doubt that when the minister and her department look at this report closely they will come back with very positive responses to it, because I think it certainly is a very worthwhile report.

          I said my purpose this morning was to place on record the appreciation of both myself and the rest of the committee for the work of the member for Brand and her colleagues who carried out this inquiry, and for the report they have presented. I also want to point out that the committee has actually re-established the subcommittee that conducted the inquiry, so they will in fact continue some of their work. From our point of view, to produce the report is extremely important but it is not the end of the process, and we want to develop methods and ideas and ways in which the report itself becomes an active vehicle for testing ideas and getting people to look further.

          Of course, the government is required to respond to the report in the three-month period. Between now and then, it is expected that the subcommittee will continue to be active and will consult with the community and the professions. In that process, the subcommittee will try to ensure that the report is seen as an active, vibrant document and not something that has been tabled and then pigeonholed.

I offer my personal congratulations on behalf of the committee to the honourable member for Brand, to the subcommittee and to the staff who helped, particularly Julie from the department, who assisted in the drafting. I support the motion that the Main Committee take note of the paper.

It is interesting to note that, despite the fact that 99 per cent of patients suffering from breast cancer are women, this issue, Australia wide, has certainly had the support of men and women. No doubt that is because not only are the patients traumatised but their entire families are often also traumatised by this disease.

          The initiative that John Hewson launched last year resulted in almost 100,000 signatures from people all over this country to endeavour to increase funding for breast cancer research. The petition deplored the fact that six Australian women per day die from breast cancer and noted that the possibility of contracting breast cancer is as high as one chance in 12 for Australian women.

          The petition also recognised the fact that breast cancer has the potential to affect every Australian family.

         Collectively, the men and women of Australia have a powerful voice. I believe it should be heard. The facts about breast cancer in this country are a national disgrace and it is up to all of us as Australians to act. In this, the International Year of the Family, we have an opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to families. What could be more important for a family than to insist on Government action to support the health and well-being of Australian people.

         The hard cold facts about breast cancer have been well highlighted in this report, and I would like to recap on some of those points. Breast cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer in women. Forty per cent of women who get breast cancer die from the disease. There is no known cause of breast cancer. There has been a rising incidence of breast cancer and it is now the most common cause of death for Australian women aged 25 to 44.

          Breast cancer affects one in 12 Australian women. Over 6,000 women per year are diagnosed with breast cancer in Australia. That means that one woman dies every four hours in this country, and six women die every day. About 2,500 women die from breast cancer each year. On present trends, over the next 10 years another 30,000 Australian women will die of breast cancer. There is quite an extensive list of facts which, when one starts to delve into them, are quite alarming. The alarming point is that very little was being done to address this issue and to make funding available for research, diagnosis, treatment and after care treatment.

          The fact that nearly 100,000 Australians signed a petition which was presented to the Australian parliament and that the government did act was a victory for democracy. It goes to show that, when ordinary Australians become involved in the processes of this place, we can actually move mountains and get places. I see that as a great victory for democracy in this country: the power of the people.

         From 1994-95, the screening program will form the basis of a new comprehensive national Breast Cancer Program. It is important to widen our focus and to address the treatment issues that are one of the most pressing concerns of women with breast cancer. It is also important to keep up Australia's research effort on this disease. The new Breast Cancer Program will therefore have two new elements.

          A National Breast Cancer Centre which will be set up under the auspices of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). It will analyse Australian and overseas research, seek medical consensus on the best treatment practices, provide accessible information on treatment and other issues to doctors and patients, and assist development of support services.

         After that petition was presented, the government set aside, as per the 1994-95 budget, a total of $16.4 million for the centre and its associated activities over a four-year period, so that meant $2.5 million for this particular budget. In addition, the government announced a measure to set up a breast cancer foundation, with this comment:

         I certainly applaud the small progress that has been made in terms of the funding, but I have to say that I was very disappointed that the government saw fit to spend $3 million setting up a new foundation when, in this country, we already have several credible foundations. I would have thought that the $3 million might have gone a long way towards helping to fund many of the initiatives that have been recommended in this report. I am deeply disappointed about that.

The member for Brand, along with others, moved this agenda forward in November 1993. That was when the then minister for health, Senator Richardson, decided that this inquiry ought to take place, following on the heels of a Senate inquiry which had begun to look at the screening process. This inquiry went well beyond that reference and looked at the broader aspects.

          I was particularly heartened to read the recommendations in relation to people in rural and remote areas of Australia.

         A considerable volume of evidence has been gathered by the Committee which shows that women who have not had access to specialist, multidisciplinary care have been disadvantaged in terms of receiving "best practice" management and treatment for breast cancer. Those at greatest disadvantage in accessing such multidisciplinary care are some women from rural and remote areas, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, and women from non-English speaking backgrounds.

          I also read with interest the submission by the daughter of a woman living in remote and rural Australia. That submission highlighted not only the problem for the patients but also the grave difficulties for families trying to offer support services. So there is little doubt that women from rural and remote areas face additional trauma because of the difficulty of accessing primary and ongoing treatment and counselling. The submission from Danielle Kelly highlighted the difficulties in giving families of cancer patients in rural and remote areas the support that they need. I hope also that the recommendations to broaden and standardise the travel assistance schemes and the provision of child care will be amongst some of the urgent matters to be addressed in this bill, given the special difficulties of women in rural and remote communities.

I also take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee and on the subcommittee that dealt with this subject for allowing me to be part of the investigation, because it was an area that I was particularly interested in when I came into this House. In fact, in October 1993, I made a speech in the House following a comment from the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), who, incidentally, ended up on this particular committee and took an interest in it. He had made the comment, in October 1993, that it was nothing short of irresponsible that, in his words, mammography  was `demeaning and painful' for the woman who was being tested.

          In our mammography units, the technical competence and expertise of those involved is incredibly high. It is an expertise that has been built up from worldwide experience. Standing here approximately three weeks after having my last mammography test, I would like to suggest that it is far better that women experience a small amount of discomfort under this quality procedure than that they live with the thought—as many women in Australia do—that they may have breast cancer and are too frightened to do anything about it. I am quite happy to experience that small amount of discomfort if only to have that moment of receiving a letter, as I did last Friday, which says that it is all clear. It is by no means demeaning to me as a woman or, I am sure, to any other woman. Peace of mind is far more important.

Often these things happen because of the dedication of those who are interested. All the members of the committee were extremely interested in this subject and that is why we members—from both sides of this House—dedicated so much time to pursuing this issue.

          The report is very detailed and I would like to talk  about four areas that, to my mind, are of specific interest. One of the recommendations in the report is about the need for education in three areas: education for undergraduates, for postgraduates, and for those in general practice. Throughout our deliberations, we saw the possibility that, in those areas, there was not quite enough education. In the undergraduate area, the committee recommended that medical schools examine their curricula, as a matter of urgency, with a view to initiating courses which will enable their undergraduates to access information about diagnosis, management and treatment of cancer, with particular reference to breast cancer. Attention must be given to educating undergraduates, especially about the emotional and psychosocial context within which patients must deal with their malignant diseases.

          As well as my personal experience of twice in my life having undergone a mammography and the three-week waiting period, I have now had the experience of listening to women throughout Australia who have had breast cancer. I know what they have to deal with, in their minds, on this subject. There is very much a need for the practitioners who are dealing with the women of Australia to understand our feelings when we are faced with the possibilities of breast cancer. And that comes right down to our general practitioners.

That was not what I expected from a GP. I expected a little more understanding. Six or seven weeks ago I approached my general practitioner—I now have a woman—on a similar issue, and she said, `Let's have a look at the mammogram and see if there's a problem,' and she talked me through it.

Last October I made a speech in which I mentioned that a unit had opened in Launceston in the previous July. I had not been there until a few weeks ago. If all the units around Australia are similar to the one in Launceston, the women of Australia should not fear having a mammogram. It was the most genteel atmosphere for that type of service that I have ever experienced in my life—a life that has been reasonably lengthy compared with others in this place.

          We must provide information to the women of Australia. That came out time and time again throughout our deliberations. Women of Australia want the information to be in a written form so that it can be read by women or, in the case of non-English speaking women, by members of their family or friends. They need the information at their fingertips so that it can be disseminated to them at a suitable time. Often information is given at the time of diagnosis. That is the time when women can become spaced out, and may I suggest that men in similar circumstances might too.

          Also, when disseminating information we must disseminate it prior to diagnosis. When I walked in the door of the breast cancer mammography screening unit in Launceston I was met by a very friendly receptionist who asked me to complete a form and read a piece of information. That information detailed, in a very gentle form, what I was going to undergo. Had I been going for my first mammography, that would have been terrific. I already knew what I was going for. In this instance I was having it in one of our units, as opposed to having it in a normal X-ray unit where I had been before. The women there had been specifically and specially trained to disseminate this information to other women. It was done in such a way that, in the half hour or so I spent there, I did not feel demeaned or afraid.

I am fortunate. One in 10 to one in 16 women in Australia are not so fortunate. So we must continue this gentle—may I stress `gentle'—but informative flow of information to the women of Australia in this regard.

          I detected an early reluctance on the part of members of the medical profession to take part in another inquiry, as the Senate had conducted its own inquiry into the early detection of breast cancer, and here was another lot of politicians wanting more of their time. That attitude changed very quickly and an excellent dialogue existed between the committee members and the profession. It was wonderful to hear from the women. I am sure it took some courage for them to come forward. There was an often expressed view that they did it in the hope that they would be able to help other women.

Even as the committee was receiving evidence, there was an endeavour on the part of some members of the profession who are leaders in their field to educate their colleagues. The report from the breast cancer consensus conference was tabled for our information by Professor Alan Coates. I reread that report last night, having not looked at it for some time, and I was interested to see documented there some of the things that we have been highlighting in our speeches and that we found during the inquiry.

          It is important to note that these people are acknowledging the things that are important to improve the outcomes for women. In this report it says that one in 25 of all women will die of breast cancer and that one in 13 will have it by the time they are 74. There is evidence that the incidence of breast cancer is on the increase. That makes allowances for the fact that there is an ageing population and that the screening programs have led to earlier detection. Thus, breast cancer is being recorded statistically to a greater degree, although perhaps previously, before those cancers were detected, those women were recorded as dying for other reasons. There is evidence that breast cancer is on the increase, so I would like to think that the inquiry will be beneficial in some way.

          It has been pointed out to me that in a report in one of the papers in the last couple of days it was said that our emphasis on the multidisciplinary teams could be construed as setting up power bases. During the inquiry, concern was expressed that centres of excellence should not just be in capital cities and not go out to the country. As members of the committee would know, and as those who read the report will find out, that was not our recommendation at all. The multidisciplinary approach is what is required. There is no need for members of that team to be physically under the same roof. In fact, interesting networks throughout the country and in rural Australia have already been established. We had evidence to that effect. I recommend that as a very flexible way to go.

          During the inquiry we heard evidence that Australia had received funding for breast cancer research due to our Third World status—given that the internationally accepted minimum in medical research is two per cent of health expenditure and Australian investment is 1.4 per cent. The minister should have been aware of criticisms made during the inquiry about a national breast cancer centre because I questioned her about it in the House on 6 June 1994. Given the political nature of her immediate response to the report, I shall quote it again for the record. It reads:

Is she aware that there has been significant criticism of the proposed $16.4 million national breast cancer centre announced in the budget? Will the minister admit that all she is doing is setting up a clearing house for research? Will she do as Professor John Forbes suggested when he gave evidence to the public inquiry into the management and treatment of breast cancer: either await the findings of that committee or, at the very least, change the terms of reference so that research becomes a function of the centre?

          —I am delighted to be able to speak to this report of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, having been a member of the subcommittee which put it together. Those who have read the report will note that the dedication is to the women of Australia and it is to the women of Australia that I would like to dedicate my speech this morning. The other speakers, both in the House and here, have spoken about the substance of the report, the methods of treatment and the management, so I will focus my brief remarks on some of the women that we came into contact with during the inquiry and also the women of my electorate.

          As a woman—and I think I can probably speak for the other women on the subcommittee—I found it was a very personal experience working on this inquiry. Some of us have had a brush with this disease in one way or another. Some years ago, I had a benign lump removed from my right breast. At the time, the gynaecologist who was treating me did not know whether the lump was cancerous. He thought it was not and, as it turned out, it was not. But, nevertheless, having an operation to remove a lump, about the size of a golf ball, was fairly traumatic and also painful. I felt very much in line with the issue.

          During the inquiry I often remarked to some of my colleagues, as we were listening to the most intimate of evidence, that I found my hand reaching towards my chest to see that everything was all right. It is something that I think only a woman could understand; it was a very moving experience. Of course, listening to that sort of medical evidence, apart from wanting to clutch my breast to see that it was okay, I was wondering: who is right? We heard such a variety of evidence. We heard from a doctor who thought that every case of breast cancer ought to result in a mastectomy and we heard from others who thought that other kinds of treatment were appropriate. I felt a mounting degree of confusion which has, to a great extent, been alleviated by the report.

          Women talked to us about their dealings with the medical profession in their particular cases. The quote which is at the introduction of chapter 2 is, I think, very apt and I would like to read it. This woman said:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Perhaps at 38 years old I was caught in a system that assumed patients are older and more willing to give in to the medical pressure. . . . Decisions were being made on my behalf and I was expected to agree and not be a problem. This kind of pressure is very difficult to withstand. . . . I don't think women are considered as equals in the decision making process. I don't know how this attitude can be turned around but I certainly felt I was treated like a child who should leave everything to the grownups.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is a quote dealing with breast cancer, but it is a quote that could apply to a lot of women in dealing with the medical profession, particularly older women. I think that younger women are a bit more wise now. They see themselves as equals with the doctors and do not treat them like gods. But it reminded me of my sister's story about her mother-in-law who, while tending an ailing and ageing spouse, used to sit indoors all day if the doctor said, `I might pop in tomorrow.'

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          That sort of attitude has gone through the profession, particularly when dealing with such an intimate part of a woman. I guess that, because of their reproductive capacity, women do get prodded and `mauled' a lot more perhaps than men do, so we are very sensitive to that. Most gynaecologists until fairly recently were men. I had a theory once that a lot of men went into gynaecology because they hated women. Certainly some that I had dealings with were that way, but I am glad to say that I found that some are excellent and very compassionate. But that can be a real problem.

          Female conditioning is part of that in saying that the doctor knows best, we must do as we are told. We had quite a number of instances of medical insensitivity to women. One woman—the members of the committee will recognise her—gave some very strong evidence. She said:

         I had a young doctor resident there . . . I was talking to him just casually one day . . . and I said something about the future. He said to me, `Oh, if I were in your situation, I wouldn't plan the future.' And I said, `Oh! What do you reckon?'. He said, `You might live two months' and he sat back.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . Then he looked at me and said, `Of course, you might live 20 years, but neither one of them is really very likely. But do not plan your future too far ahead, will you?'

         This is a woman who had a very responsible position in the community. She lives a fair way from a major city. When she discovered that she had breast cancer, the specialist who gave her the news said something like, `Well, you've got breast cancer. Do you have private insurance?' When she said no, he held the door open and said, `I don't treat public patients.' The honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) has talked about the need for sensitivity, the need for counselling and the psychological effects. I must say that I felt, `My God, how would I feel if something like that happened?' Any woman hearing that would be absolutely devastated.

          This same woman had to travel a long way to a major city for chemotherapy, thought she had finished the course, came back and was told that, no, she had only had half of it. When she refused to go back because her arms were black and blue from all the treatment, the doctor called her husband in and talked only to her husband. He said, `If she doesn't continue with this treatment, it's down to you, it's your fault'. As she said, they did not speak for several weeks before she resumed some treatment. In the end she gave up and said, `Well, if I'm going to die, I'm going to die.' She is still a very prominent person in her community and surviving.

          But the kind of women that we spoke to would fall into two categories—obviously, younger women and older women. In relation to the older women I found that, certainly in the inquiry but also in my electorate, I had a lot of women come to see me after I had made it known that I was on this committee. Also one of my local doctors arranged for a whole morning in his surgery when he brought in, one after another, women with breast cancer that he had treated. The stories of the older women were very tragic because most of them were, by that time, at a stage where the cancer had spread to other parts of the body—it is particularly tragic once it is in the bones. They were undergoing at that stage, I guess, palliative treatment and pain control.

          One woman gave me a little notebook that she kept. She had entered every contact, every experience and every treatment in it. It went back over some years. I felt very emotional about seeing that—the record of her life and her treatment. Her husband was beside her and very supportive. She talked positively about what was happening next. I thought she was going to die, and probably quite soon. But she stoically went on.

          We also met some of the women in Dubbo whom the member for Adelaide referred to, particularly women on farms, who were, in many cases, running the farms themselves. They had to go to the city for treatment—for surgery and for radiotherapy or chemotherapy—yet they were still there, running their farms and saying, `I am not going to let this thing get me down.' I think that was very important.

          The younger women, as shown by the quote I just gave, are a little bit more uppity and want better treatment. One woman in my electorate told me of her experience. She was in her early 30s and had just entered into a new relationship when it was discovered that she had breast cancer. Her GP referred her to the local surgeon—a very good surgeon—and he said, `Fine. We will have to take the breast off.' She actually worked at the hospital, although not in a medical situation, and she knew her way around enough to know that she should get a second opinion. So she went to one of the well-known doctors that we took evidence from at Westmead Hospital. He examined her and said, `No. There is no need to remove your breast. You can have a lumpectomy and have conservative treatment after that.' To his credit, the surgeon who first gave an opinion carried out that operation. He was not too stuck in his ways; he simply was not one of those specialised people. A lot has been said by other speakers about the need in this area for specialists who really know the disease intimately.

          The other problem of my constituents and a lot of the people we heard from was the problem of having to travel for treatment. Those honourable members who know my electorate will know that it is a couple of hours drive from Sydney and there are some very isolated places in it. Women have to travel long distances to have chemotherapy and to have radiotherapy. I am glad to say that, after a lot of lobbying, the present government—I hope it is not just because it has an election coming up in a couple of weeks—has now announced that it will open an oncology outreach clinic at the Blue Mountains hospital in Katoomba, so women can have their chemotherapy there. There is an outreach radiotherapy clinic planned for the Nepean Hospital at Penrith, so those women in my electorate will not have to travel quite as far.

          We heard also about the psychosocial needs involved. Another interesting quote from someone who gave us evidence was:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Recent evidence . . . suggests that women who were involved in their treatment decision and where medically possible, offered some choice tended to be better psychologically adjusted at a three year follow-up. It did not matter which surgery type they had chosen.
        </para>
        <para>
         That goes back to what I started with—the treatment of the attitude of doctors towards women. Women who have doctors who sit down and explain to them what is happening, give them some choices and explain what the alternatives are—as we have seen from that quote and all the other evidence we took—are much better adjusted to their situation, as are their families.

          Of course, this disease, as we have said, has sexual connotations and female image connotations. One of the things that I certainly would fear would be its effect on how I looked and so on. Somebody quoted a person from a support group who was sitting by the bed of a recovering patient and said, `Your husband will still love you.' I think the member for Adelaide loves that quote. I think that is at the heart of a lot of those situations. I have heard men talking about this disease on the radio, saying, `All I wanted was my wife to be well.' But I am sure there are men who feel that their wives are no longer complete.

          I have some wonderful older women in my electorate who make jokes about their prostheses: `Oh God, I have lost some weight and now the other one is too big!'. One was talking about doing the garden and leaning over and having her prosthesis slip out. I think this is where support groups are very important. They mean that the women can get together and talk about those things with like-minded people, and share a joke like that, as well as expressing how they feel about themselves and about the disease.

          I would also like to comment on the remarks by the member for Adelaide about the newspaper reports of the reaction of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) to the report. In fact, the minister did not say those things. The comments were made by someone on her staff and, I understand, were misquoted. The minister is very supportive of what we have done and I am sure she will give the report her full attention when she responds to it.

It is a job well done and I look forward to seeing some very positive results from it. I commend the report to the House.

          I have read the report. I believe it is a substantial report and a landmark report as well. It is significant because there has not been a lot of information about breast cancer in the past. We are beginning to recognise that breast cancer kills six Australian women per day. The mortality rate of 40 per cent has not changed that much over the last 50 years and it is an important issue. I acknowledge my colleagues from Western Australia now sitting in the gallery.

          As I said, the report is a landmark report because it covers a number of issues, in particular, improving knowledge at medical schools and helping doctors to become more aware of the issue by updating their skills.

          I want to raise two points. The first concerns information. This point has been discussed with me by a colleague in Western Australia. This particular woman has had a mastectomy. She told me that at the time she was told she had breast cancer no information was given to her. As the member for Bass quite rightly said before, when told of tragic news it is hard to take in information immediately. There was no information given to her so that she could go back to her family and discuss the issue. I would like to read recommendation 29 on information. It states:

         The committee recommends that women be provided by practitioners with written information about breast cancer to which they and their families can refer repeatedly.
        </para>
        <para>
         I think the emphasis is on `repeatedly' because it is a process and the information needs to be looked at repeatedly. The recommendation goes on:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The information should be written to meet the differing needs of individuals by encompassing approaches which range from the purely supportive to the medically sophisticated. Information should be presented in a manner which will not make assumptions about which level of information the recipient will require.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is a very significant recommendation and one that all the people involved professionally—whether they are practitioners or are involved through government—should look at and address immediately. It is a very important area and I would like to do justice to the woman who came to me and asked me to try to get this information in, as well as congratulating the committee for recognising its importance and putting it in the report.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The other area of importance for me in discussing this whole issue is increasing funding. I know that the government is increasing funding in research and I compliment it on that. But I do not believe it is enough; I do not believe it is anywhere near enough. I get criticised repeatedly by the member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) for a statement when I spoke  about AIDS. I was not commenting on AIDS, but on the parity between diseases. I said that the funding disparity between research on breast cancer and other diseases was alarming, and that that was not a criticism of other funding projects but an urgent call for parity. That is what I am calling for, and in every discussion and speech I have made on breast cancer, I have asked for an increase in funding and research, because it is a serious issue that the community does not necessarily pay enough attention to.

          Finally, I would like to say that the report is great. It should not be put on the bookshelves of history and be forgotten under cobwebs. I am sure that members of the committee, because of their compassion about the subject, will ensure that it gets the recognition it deserves. I can assure the committee, and also my colleagues on the subcommittee, that I, too, will not let the issue rest. It is one that I have taken on board as an issue for me to continually work with whilst I am in parliament. I give that assurance to my colleagues and fellow committee members, and I again congratulate the committee and its chair for their great work.

          I would like to concentrate on three areas in the report: data collection, research and counselling. As a lay person who sought to gain a real understanding of all aspects of the management and treatment of breast cancer, one would assume that the normal starting point would be reading all the available material associated with the topic. I must admit that I could not match the member for Brand (Ms Fatin) in her enthusiasm, but I did try to gain some understanding. I found that the medical side of this equation was readily available, but the real missing link was the paucity of regional, state and national data which would enable anyone, let alone a beginner, to try to comprehend a comparison of treatments and outcomes. In this day and age, with the emphasis on technology and the information age, there is no reason why data cannot be collected, collated and exchanged in any part of this country.

          One wonders at the wisdom residing in the decision makers and administrators both in the hospitals and the state and Commonwealth health departments who have not yet come to realise that, without a properly resourced national data collection system which can access and compare state and territory information, enabling the comparison of treatments and outcomes in the management and treatment of breast cancer in women throughout Australia, these women are getting a second-class deal.

          The committee was told on several occasions that the hospital registrars, the bean counters, saw the staff involved in this valuable aspect of the medical process as the first in line of dispensable people when cutbacks occurred in hospitals. As a former resident, I was pleased to note that South Australia was to the forefront in establishing a prototype hospital base register system. It is interesting to note the comments made by Professor Alan Langlands in this regard:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         It is essential that long term funding is provided to make available outcome data on diagnostic and treatment strategies. To do so, cancer registries based on the individual hospitals and health areas must be funded and developed as a matter of priority. This requires financial support for Area, State and National co-ordination. Additional funding is also required to ensure that Hospitals have access to the appropriate biostatistical advice and computing facilities adequately supported.

        <para>
         Professor Martin commented:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Cancer registries properly maintained can exert a beneficial influence on medical staff concerned with patient care in hospital. Its maintenance can lead to a modification of treatment regimes, better record keeping and provide up to date results for study by hospital staff. Unless this is done one finds the staff, even medical staff, have a total ignorance of what is being accomplished within their own hospital. I have absolutely no doubt that if earmarked funding was provided for public hospital breast cancer registers, preferably using an agreed history, examination and treatment proforma, that advances in the treatment of these patients would become available more rapidly, particularly if the hospitals were able to pool their data.

         I now move to the contentious issue of research. Research into breast cancer is currently pursued in two major forms: research at the cellular level, particularly molecular biology; and clinical trials where differing types of treatment are tested. In this regard it is interesting to note the comments made to the committee by Dr Stephen Birrell from the Flinders Medical Centre on the overall lack of financial support for medical research:

         This is the second time that I have been involved in a House committee report on health issues. In the other case I was also amazed at the lack of coordination in the health system in this country. I guess, as a beginner, that this is a result of having vested control in the states and then expecting the federal government to fill in the pieces or pick up the tab when the system fails or when there is a need to have a national approach to a particular health issue. Another complicating issue is the size of and power exerted by the very large hospitals in the capital cities. Quite often their priorities are not those of the governments and by their ingenuity they have managed to find funding sources outside the system.

          It does appal me as an Australian to realise that Australia has achieved recognition as a Third World country when it comes to the amount of money allocated to medical research. What annoys me even more is that there does not appear to be any concerted, systematic and rational approach to the whole issue by all the sectors involved. I think it is time to stop the point scoring and address the issues immediately. We must work to stop the whole issue of health funding, and health research funding in particular, being addressed on an ad hoc basis.

         Many breast cancer patients complain to us about the cold and clinical way their medical practitioner or specialist informs them of a cancer diagnosis. There often appears to be little account taken of how the diagnosis affects the patient emotionally or how the prospect of surgery may damage the patient's relationship with her partner if she has one. Sometimes marriages break down after breast surgery. Many medical practitioners do not refer their patients to organisations such as ours for support.

          —The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs report on the management and treatment of breast cancer is the second major report on breast cancer produced by the current parliament. The first, which dealt with breast cancer screening and the treatment in Australia, was conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs last year and was responded to by the government in December. While there is some amount of overlap between the two reports, they provide an overview of breast cancer and raise many important questions about the way we are dealing with the disease, from screening right through to education and research. Today I wish to touch on some of these issues, particularly as they relate to women in my regionally based electorate of Hinkler. Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer in women. However, it is really a disease that ultimately touches every person, male or female, and every dimension of the family; and even the extended family is affected. The statistics are even more frightening, with breast cancer affecting one in 12 Australian women. Over 6,000 women a year are diagnosed with breast cancer in Australia. About 2,500 women per year, or seven per day, die of the disease in Australia. On present trends—and this is a frightening statistic—over the next 10 years, if current patterns were to stay in place, 30,000 women would die of breast cancer.

          With the growing focus and awareness of breast cancer since the last election, these two parliamentary inquiries are both timely and very valuable, as they have generated a lot of interest, information and community discussion. What I have found most pleasing in these two reports is the recognition, at last, of the disadvantage and sacrifice faced by women living in rural and regional areas such as my own, based on the provincial cities of Bundaberg and Gladstone.

          The 1991 census figures showed that 47 per cent of women aged 35 years and over reside in non-capital city areas. I suspect the figure is even higher in Queensland. There is clearly a huge responsibility for government and the medical fraternity to address the need of these women living outside the capital cities, particularly as breast cancer is a disease that affects older women. Yet, as these two parliamentary reports testify, this has been the area where the infrastructure and support for screening, treatment and management of breast cancer have been abysmally lacking.

          There is no clearer evidence of this than in my own electorate of Hinkler, yet fortunately I can report that in relation to public screening facilities the situation is at least on the improve. Women over 40 years of age and living in Bundaberg, in the Wide Bay-Burnett subregion, generally have not found it easy to take advantage of the Commonwealth's much publicised national program for early detection of breast cancer.

          These at risk women have to travel up to 300 kilometres or more in one direction or other to access free public screening, either to Nambour on the Sunshine Coast or to Rockhampton in Central Queensland. For many of these women it is a one- or two-day trip that is difficult to afford in time and money, as many of them have the responsibilities of children and/or workplace activities. Too often, women have to put off getting a screening mammogram because of the inconvenience and the cost. Thankfully, from time to time, various community organisations have organised the so-called `boob buses', a term I do not use in any disparaging way. They are a measure of the substandard service that has to be offered to women, notwithstanding the fact that the people who organise those services do a marvellous job.

          Following the government's further five-year commitment to the national screening program as contained in last year's budget, Wide Bay-Burnett women will at last be able to have access to a free screening centre closer to home. Last July, after several years of waiting and lengthy community consultation, a new three-pronged public screening service was announced for the southern part of my region. This will include a fixed screening and assessment unit based in Bundaberg, a satellite service based in Hervey Bay, and a relocatable unit to travel to the more remote hospitals within the region.

          The new $800,000 screening and assessment unit in Bundaberg is due for completion in the middle of this year and will include a medical director, Dr Therese Ryan—who has already been appointed—a radiographer and nursing and administrative staff. The unit will also have access to other specialist staff, both public and private, including pathologists and radiologists. It will provide a caring and multidisciplinary approach, as discussed by my colleague the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), in terms of breast cancer screening in the Wide Bay area.

          There has been some debate in the Bundaberg community that the new public facility will simply duplicate the service that is already provided by the private sector. This is a fact that comes out in one of the recommendations of the Senate committee's report, recommendation 16, which reads:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         That the Program avoid any duplication in the provision of screening services, but that it utilise both the private and public sectors in the provision of screening services subject to all the services meeting the guidelines for accreditation established by the National Program.
        </para>
        <para>
         Some duplication will occur in Bundaberg, but that will only be to a certain extent. Wide Bay and Burnett women can currently get a screening mammogram from a private clinic; however, it is not free. Only diagnostic mammograms attract the Medicare rebate, and that is only if there are actual symptoms of breast cancer or if there is a history of disease in the family. One civic-minded local clinic has been charging patients the Medicare rebate level of 85 per cent of the scheduled fee so, in that instance, there has been no additional cost. However, the fees have to be paid up front.

        <para first-indent="16">

          Further, the new Bundaberg public clinic will provide a complete, specialist and unique information centre for breast cancer screening. Where private operators have won the day and have provided the free public screening program, such as in Cairns in Far North Queensland, the private operator has set up a specialist facility like the public facility planned for Bundaberg. I am certainly a firm believer in making greater use of the private sector, and I expect there will be some significant contribution from the private sector in the provision of the national screening program in the Wide Bay and Burnett area. Firstly, it is likely that the Bundaberg core centre will use privately based radiologists to read film; and, secondly, the satellite service at Hervey Bay, while not yet finalised, could possibly be contracted out to a private operator.

          That aside, given the long wait that the Wide Bay and Burnett women have had, and still have, for such a free screening service, I have publicly supported the interim measure of the government paying a fee or a rebate to private clinics that perform screening mammograms for eligible women in the age group at risk, or for those who require diagnostic help. Given the sheer number of women to be screened in the Wide Bay and Burnett area, making use of private facilities in the interim would seem a commonsense approach.

          Moving then to the northern part of my electorate, which is in Central Queensland, women from Gladstone, Mackay and Longreach, and from the central west in general, have had to travel to Rockhampton to take advantage of a free public screening program.

Over the last two years, she has organised some twenty-eight 18-seater buses to transport local women to Rockhampton. In total, she and the Port Curtis Lioness Club have transported over 400 Gladstone women to Rockhampton. This is truly a remarkable achievement, and I understand that the Lioness Club buses are still operating under the new president, Shirley Lee.

          Still, for many of these women, and other women in centres such as Biloela and elsewhere in the northern part of my electorate, it takes at least a whole day—if not two days—to obtain a free mammogram in Rockhampton. For women of Longreach and the central west—part of the electorates of my colleagues the members for Kennedy (Mr Katter), Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and Capricornia (Ms Henzell)—the time taken is more like three days: a day to drive in; a day for the screening; and a day to get home. Again, many women have been unable to afford this sort of time and cost, and have put their own health at risk for the sake of the family business.

          Thankfully, this situation is about to change, with the commissioning of a new mobile breast screening van to be ready in mid-April. This van, complete with two roving radiographers, should be ready to handle about 40 women a day. It will enable women who had previously been unable to readily access Rockhampton to have access to a regular public screening service: something that their city sisters have enjoyed for some time. The vehicle will be a valuable educational tool as well, disseminating breast cancer information to many parts of the Central Queensland area.

          I, like many women and families of Central Queensland, am eagerly awaiting the mobile service's first scheduled visits. Although the mobile unit in Central Queensland is eagerly awaited, I believe the service could be further enhanced within my electorate with the provision of a satellite service in Gladstone, perhaps not unlike the one I mentioned earlier in respect of Hervey Bay. Whilst I recognise that there is not the same specialist fraternity available in Gladstone as there is in Rockhampton and Bundaberg—and my colleague also mentioned the necessity of that networking arrangement—I believe that it is important that Gladstone be recognised in women's health matters as a growing community with diverse medical needs. It is a rapidly expanding industrial city and it needs this kind  of service in order to be ahead of the pace, rather than behind it.

          Further, whilst I in no way depreciate the quality of a mobile unit or the necessity for it, I intend to lobby for a permanent free-standing satellite unit to be established at the Gladstone Base Hospital.

          A Gladstone satellite screening service could mirror what is being done in Hervey Bay. Films would have to be read and data based in Rockhampton, but I believe that would be a better system than periodic van visits, particularly in the light of the demand already demonstrated in Gladstone, with over 500 women having travelled to Rockhampton on organised buses in the last two years. Such an extension of the Central Queensland service fits in neatly with what both parliamentary committees have recommended in terms of access for women.

          During the Brisbane hearings of this committee I, like many other people, was horrified to hear a prominent Brisbane breast cancer surgeon say that some women living on drought affected properties had sacrificed themselves for their families, by choosing a quick mastectomy instead of six weeks radiation therapy in Brisbane. It is horrific that women should have to sacrifice their health because of the drought—the quick mastectomy and then on with the work. It shows the spirit of those women, but it is a dreadful price to pay. Another prominent Brisbane breast surgeon said in evidence:

          Similarly, there should be provision in such travel assistance for an escort, especially for patients receiving treatment for the first time.

          —I congratulate the honourable member for Brand (Ms Fatin) and the members of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs for an excellent report. I will follow the previous speaker in confining my comments to the provision of these services to rural and remote regions. I draw the attention of the Main Committee to that section of the report dealing with rural and remote patients. Forty-seven per cent of women aged 35 years and over reside in non-capital city areas, and that proportion is larger in Queensland. The report states the obvious: most of these women are disadvantaged in their access to breast cancer multidisciplinary teams and allied treatments. The report goes on to discuss lower referral rates and looks at the reasons why this occurs.

          The first reason, and I think it is probably the main reason, is the current lack of mammography screening programs in country areas, which has led to most lesions presenting at the palpable stage with a consequent need for more radical surgery to be undertaken. That is the real problem that we have to address in rural and remote areas. It is obvious that the second and third are also difficulties. They are in relation to assessing radiotherapy facilities and the practices of some country based surgeons being a problem. But it is true, as the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) said, that we have got a lot to do to provide these services to all women in Australia, wherever they reside.

          I must say that in my electorate it is very welcome that there is a breast screening unit now at Calvary Hospital in Cairns, which is accessible to women in Cairns. But I also represent the remote areas of the Torres Strait and Cape York Peninsula, and that does provide real technical difficulties in relation to providing mammography screening programs. I have been dealing with this as long as I have been the member for Leichhardt. The difficulty is that we have not got the technology right to get the screening to remote areas. The main problem is the roads: the roads are just too rough to get the screening units out there. It is very sensitive equipment which cannot be shipped around the country without damage, which would therefore damage its effectiveness, so it is a real problem. That is something that we have to address in terms of research and development. We need to provide some sort of scheme to do that.

          It has been suggested that one way of getting these units in is by barge, and I think Queensland Health is looking at that at the moment. That is particularly relevant at this time of year, the wet season, when that is sometimes the only way you can get into remote communities. Communities in my electorate like Weipa, Kowanyama, Aurukun and Lockhart River are accessible by barge, and that may be one way of getting the equipment in. It has been suggested on some occasions that there is also a problem with the reliability of electricity supplies for these units, so that may be another problem, but I have been assured by the FNQEB that in Far North Queensland that is not a problem. Nevertheless, we have got this problem about the roads, and that has to be resolved.

          Unfortunately, in my electorate there is also a problem in areas that are not so remote. I have had correspondence from the Douglas Shire Health Action Group, and I commend that group for its concern about this issue. I also commend the Queensland government generally for setting up and funding health action groups. I think they play a very good role. They are set up mainly to lobby the state government, but obviously they lobby members of the federal government about health issues in their areas.

          The Douglas Shire Health Action Group has a valid complaint that the mobile unit that has been set up in Far North Queensland does not go to Mossman and Port Douglas. For the benefit of people who do not know, I should say that Port Douglas is about an hour's drive from Cairns, and Mossman is a little bit further on. Although it is a windy road, it is not a dirt road. I have got here a letter from the then Queensland Minister for Health, Ken Hayward, explaining simply that the Queensland health department set up a breast screening clinic which operates out of Townsville and functions on a two-year cycle. The letter says:

         Unfortunately, the clinic does not go to the Douglas Shire area in my electorate. It is a similar problem which the honourable member for Hinkler experiences in his electorate, in that women in Mossman and Port Douglas have to travel to Cairns. We are talking about the more senior members of the community, and there is little or no public transport between Mossman, Port Douglas and Cairns.

          The health action group has been looking at the situation, and there is a booking at a Cairns unit for women from the Douglas Shire, which will go some way towards solving the problem. Nevertheless, it is a real problem. We have women who, though they do not live in the remote areas of Australia, live in areas which are remote from regional centres, and they cannot access these facilities easily. Because of the very serious nature of breast cancer, we cannot afford to say that it is easy for women to drive for an hour or to stay overnight. Breast cancer is too important an issue to give those sorts of solutions.

          I commend the government when I say that we have come a long way. I notice that the honourable member for Hinkler is nodding; this issue is a bipartisan issue. Although we are addressing the problem, nevertheless, we have to do more. The report on the management and treatment of breast cancer in Australia by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs recommends that the Commonwealth government, in conjunction with state and territory governments, standardise and broaden the travel assistance scheme. The report says that, in the event this cannot be achieved, the Commonwealth should assume full responsibility. I commend this recommendation. I know that the report is referring to the treatment of breast cancer, but obviously that point also applies in relation to screening for breast cancer.

          I strongly recommend to the government that further resources be provided to carry out research into how we can provide breast screening units in the most remote areas of Australia. The reality is that the service is being denied to the women who live on Cape York Peninsula not because of the lack of resources, but because of the lack of technology. Women from that area have to come to Cairns to have the proper treatment or screening, and that means at least a two-day trip. In the case of breast screening, we have to develop a way to get screening units into remote areas.

          The report made reference to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women. The reality is that the women in remote communities, although they may come to Cairns from time to time, generally will not take the initiative to travel to Cairns for breast screening. If women in remote communities are to have access to breast screening, and remembering the level of poverty in those communities, a breast screening unit must be taken to them. If we do not have the technology at present, it is the responsibility of all political parties, at both state and federal level, to ensure that the resources are there so that the service can be provided.

The women in the parliament, of both sides, have raised this issue and surely we need no other evidence that there should be more women in the parliament. Now that we have got more women in the parliament we are starting to talk about these sorts of issues which affect women. It is a tribute also to this parliament that we are adopting a bipartisan attitude towards the whole issue. I commend the report.

          As we have canvassed the main report pretty broadly today, I will just make a few personal comments. They are not about my personal health, because fortunately I have never had to experience breast cancer. But I suppose because of my age—I am now in my early 50s—I could not have escaped the fact that friends and colleagues of mine at various stages in recent years have had breast cancer. As a consequence of that, their experience touches people around them, as we found during our inquiry. Families and friends are very much involved in the business of breast cancer.

          During a visit to the United Kingdom in 1991 I decided to go to Scotland to meet a man, Professor Pat Forrest, whom I had read about in the Australian media. Pat Forrest was an eminent surgeon but is now retired. He was a person given the task of setting up the actual breast screening clinic in Scotland, and subsequently throughout the rest of the UK. I understand that he has a wife who comes from Melbourne and as a consequence he knew quite a bit about Australia. When visiting here he had made some rather critical comment about the management and treatment of women with breast cancer. I was interested in that, because it was not the sort of criticism that one would just look at and say, `Either he does not understand the situation or he is wanting to have a go at somebody.' It was constructive comment.

          So I went to talk with him about the treatment of breast cancer because, just before that overseas visit, a friend of mine, who had actually worked on my staff, was diagnosed as having breast cancer. I watched with a great deal of distress her efforts to get treatment and to be managed by the various people in Western Australia who were available to her. I also began then to look at other people who were similarly in what I called a maze of not knowing where to go and how to get appropriate treatment. So I talked to Pat Forrest and he to me.

          When I came back to Australia it was a topic that never really left the back of my mind as one that maybe this parliament could get involved in. I was not sure how to begin the process because it is true that we had begun the debate about setting up a national mammography program in about 1988-89 and, after the government decided to introduce the program with the cooperation of the states and territories, that began to take place. Whilst there are certain comments that one can make about that, our inquiry had nothing to do with diagnosis; we were not looking at the diagnosis of breast cancer but rather what happened to a woman once she was diagnosed. When I became a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs it seemed appropriate to set up a subcommittee and look at the management and treatment of breast cancer in this country.

          I also wish to comment on the medical profession. At the beginning, for about six months, I read medical journals and other medical information about current practice in terms of treatment and management—when I could get my hands on any such literature—and I became conscious of the fact that the medical profession might look at our inquiry as being inappropriate and that it was important to gain its cooperation. We needed members of the profession to talk to us, to tell us what was optimal care and what was occurring when they were treating women with breast cancer. It was equally important to speak to the women and ask them what was happening to them and to hear their stories.

          My colleague from Adelaide has mentioned some members of the profession whom she spoke to at various times to check and confirm things or to further understand certain matters. I think the first such person contacted us, and that was Mr Colin Furnival, an eminent surgeon, who rang the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) and expressed a concern that there had been an inquiry in the Senate that we were duplicating. I reassured him that we were not and that ours was quite different. From that time, he and I were able to talk at any time when there were things to confirm or check. I found him very approachable and I appreciated that very much indeed. He also came before our inquiry. As members of the committee would know, he is the chair of the breast surgery section of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in Australia so his appearance before us was very valuable.

          I finish my remarks by saying that, in fact, in this country, women are able to achieve and find some of the best treatment and management in the world. There is no question of that. But the difficulty is that not enough women are able to access that form of multidisciplinary care. Our report tries to show how that can happen, and we are asking for cooperation not only from the Commonwealth government but also from the state and territory governments—because, of course, it is they who have the delivery responsibilities of health, and governments can do quite a deal towards providing services—and also from the profession itself and the capacity of the profession to actually deliver multidisciplinary care to women with breast cancer.

          In a sense, when one reads the report, one will see that most of the recommendations do go to the profession itself. The way in which I have explained that—when I was asked, `How did you conclude what it is that you have recommended? How did you come to those recommendations?'—was to say that we held a mirror up to members of the profession and let them hear what they were saying. We let them talk about the lack of data. When we could not find it, we asked them if it was there and they said no, and they were telling us how they might be able to get it. When we talked about optimal care, they told us how it could be provided.

When we asked, `Can the care be taken to them, or should they be taken to the treatment and management?' the profession was able to show us how it could be done.

        (4) Issues such as population size and coverage are re-examined prior to each Budget. The population of coverage areas can vary over time quite significantly. Costs vary considerably depending on topography, geographic size of the area to be covered, signal strength required and infrastructure costs to accommodate the new facilities. Indicative costs are the estimates for extending the service to Richmond/Tweed of $1.82m for capital and $0.29m for operation and maintenance and Wide Bay of $3.03m for capital and $0.60m for operation and maintenance.

        (1) No. It simply reflects the fact that, in this situation, and as indicated in my reply to Question 1808 of 5 December 1994, the investigation of such claims or allegations is a matter for the appropriate Papua New Guinea (PNG) authorities. Should those authorities approach the Australian Government, the Government would cooperate with any duly authorised investigation.

        (2) Most of Australia's aid is provided in the form of Australian goods and services for specific, rigorously designed projects and programs. In this way, the aid we provide can be managed and monitored from port of dispatch to project site. We aim for stringent accountability in all our arrangements with contractors, consultants, international organisations and other governments. Further, the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB), undertakes its own regular and intensive monitoring and evaluation of aid projects and programs through its network of aid posts in developing countries and Canberra-based personnel. These procedures, combined with effective monitoring and review mechanisms, make it extremely difficult for aid funds to be redirected to alternative uses by recipient countries and ensure that the aid program is well directed.

        PNG is the only country to which we provide significant assistance in monetary form as untied budget support. However, both the Australian and PNG Governments have agreed that budget support will be phased out by the end of the decade. It is planned that there will be, commencing in FY 1994/95, a seven year straight line reduction of budget support to zero in FY 2000/01, and a corresponding increase in sector program aid. This will be consistent with the approach we take with other countries receiving Australian aid.

        Program aid is provided to support a wide range of development activities in six priority sectors (infrastructure, health, education, law and order, renewable resources and the private sector).

        (1) The most recent available data are for the 12 months ending December 1994. These data show that some 59% of former Jobstart participants were in unsubsidised employment around 3 months after participation in the program.

        Information on the longer term outcomes of former participants was gathered between March and September 1992 as part of the evaluation of Jobstart. The evaluation found that around 53% of former participants were in employment 6 to 8 months after termination of subsidy payments. This outcomes level is comparable to the post program monitoring estimate for the year to end March 1992 which indicated that 55% of clients were in employment 3 months after program participation.

        Further information on longer term Jobstart outcomes was gathered between August 1994 and January 1995 as part of the development of extended post program monitoring. Estimates based on pilot surveys indicate that longer term outcomes levels are comparable to those at 3 months after program participation. While the data are subject to seasonal influences and require confirmation through further surveys, unsubsidised employment outcomes 6 and 12 months after program participation were found to be around 60%.
