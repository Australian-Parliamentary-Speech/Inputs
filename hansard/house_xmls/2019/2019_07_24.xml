                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will amend the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, the Privacy Act 1988, and the Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010 to introduce a consumer data right and open banking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today is another major step in Australia's data revolution. With this bill, Australia becomes a world leader in implementing an economy-wide right for consumers to access and use data that businesses hold about them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This important reform will provide individuals and businesses with a right to access data relating to them; and to authorise secure access to their data by accredited data recipients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will also enable data about products on offer to be available in machine readable form.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The consumer data right is a right for consumers to authorise data sharing and use. Consumers will determine which data is shared under the right, on what terms and with whom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The consumer data right is a game changer for consumers and small businesses. It will enable consumers to better harness their data for their own benefit. The consumer data right is a fundamental structural reform that will drive competition and improve the flow of information around the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the right will incentivise Australian entrepreneurs to develop new products and applications that reach more consumers and are better tailored to their needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For consumers, improved access to data will support better price comparison services, taking into account their unique circumstances, and promote more convenient switching between products and providers. It will also leverage new technology such as artificial intelligence and allow consumers to make more informed decisions on where they spend their money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For small and medium businesses, it will allow for more effective budgeting tools that can deal with data in real time and help them manage their cashflow and working capital more effectively than they can do today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Improved access to data will also enable the development of new, better and more convenient products and services, many customised to individuals' needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We live in a world of increasing complexity. Many consumers need assistance in understanding the choices open to them and how best to navigate the sheer volume of choices presented to them—choices that may not be presented in a way that allows them to make effective comparisons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, the recent Productivity Commission review on competition in the Australian financial system reported that the average Australian household could be saving up to $1,000 per year on their home loan if they switched to another lender—but many do not. With over 4,000 different residential property loans on offer, it is no wonder that customers struggle to determine which home loan is best for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The consumer data right provides efficient and convenient access to accurate information and empowers third parties to develop tools that will allow consumers to make the most of the choices available to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These tools are likely to include comparison sites that take into account the actual ways the consumer uses the product; budgeting apps that analyse actual spending behaviours; and services that assess the expected return for a household that is considering the installation of rooftop solar panels taking into account their actual electricity usage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By doing so, the consumer data right will increase competition and drive consumer focused innovation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The consumer data right will support data-driven innovation across the economy. New high-value jobs will be created by positioning Australia at the global forefront of data access and innovation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In introducing this bill today, we are implementing commitments made by the government in its response to its review into open banking in Australia<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>and to the<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>Productivity Commission's<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>data availability and use<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>inquiry.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has committed to applying the consumer data right to banking, where it is referred to as open banking, then to the energy and telecommunications sectors, and in due course more widely across the economy.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When deciding whether to add new sectors or datasets as being subject to the consumer data right, the minister will be required to seek the public advice of both the ACCC and Information Commissioner. The minister must consider a range of factors prior to adding a sector, including the impact on consumers, competition, data-driven innovation, privacy and confidentiality, and whether the data may contain intellectual property. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also creates a rules and technical standards framework that recognises the need to allow for flexibility in implementation over time as technology adapts and between sectors that have different risks and differing levels of technological capability. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nevertheless, implementation between sectors should be as consistent and interoperable as possible.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Strong privacy and information security provisions are a fundamental design feature of the consumer data right. These protections include privacy safeguards and additional privacy protections through the consumer data rules. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner will advise on and enforce privacy protections, and provide complaint handling for breaches of the privacy safeguards. Consumers will have a range of avenues to seek remedies for breaches of their privacy or confidentiality, including access to internal and external dispute resolution and direct rights of action.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only trusted and accredited third parties will be able to access data from data holders at the customer's direction. Accreditation can be considered to be a 'data safety licence'. Accreditation will contribute to the justified confidence that consumers can have that the system supports safety and security for their data.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACCC will be responsible for advising what sectors should be added, writing rules, accrediting new participants and enforcing serious and systemic breaches of consumers' rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Complementing the rules, technical standards turn what is a right in principle into real action. The data standards chair, advised by the Data Standards Body, will be responsible for working with businesses, consumers and innovators to ensure that the right is implemented in a way that promotes efficiency, convenience and safety. Consistent standards will support access to data that is usable and reduce the barriers to service providers offering new services to consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also contains a statutory review provision, with a review to be completed by 1 July 2022. This review will provide an opportunity for the government to confirm that the system is operating as intended and to consider the impacts of the system on consumers and industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank the active and ongoing engagement by industry, consumer and privacy groups, and fintechs in the development of this bill. I also thank them for their ongoing engagement in the Productivity Commission's inquiry and the Open Banking Review and in the development of rules by the ACCC and standards by Data61.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In December 2017, the royal commission released its final report, which detailed too many instances of people who had been entrusted with looking after Australia's children doing too little to protect those children from unimaginable harm. When vulnerable people were being subjected to sickening abuse, these people knew of the harrowing circumstances and did nothing. Rather than reporting to police and taking protective action, they turned a blind eye or even took actions to conceal the abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In line with the recommendations of the royal commission, this bill will introduce two new offences into the Criminal Code to criminalise Commonwealth officers who exercise care, supervision or authority over children and fail to report child sexual abuse, or negligently fail to reduce or remove the risk of child sexual abuse to those children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms send a very clear message: the safety of our children should always be put first. The Commonwealth has zero tolerance for child sexual abuse and expects all Commonwealth officers who are charged with caring and supervising children to fulfil their obligations to protect those children.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill strengthens the Commonwealth framework of offences to ensure a comprehensive, technology-neutral and future-focused response to more forms of child abuse material. In particular, the bill will clarify the law to ensure that the abhorrent new trend of child-like sex dolls, used to simulate sexual intercourse with children, is clearly and robustly stamped out in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also introduce a new offence for possessing or controlling child abuse material in the form of data stored on a computer or data storage device. Every single time child abuse material is viewed, the child portrayed in that material is revictimised and their trauma compounded. We must strive to ensure our laws protect children from the dangers posed by abusers who operate online.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to other recommendations of the royal commission, the bill strengthens the laws in the Criminal Code for persistent child sexual abuse committed overseas by removing difficulties associated with prosecuting repeated instances of abuse.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission highlighted that it is often the worst forms of offending—the repeated, regular and ongoing sexual abuse of children—that are the most difficult to prove. That is because child victims of this kind of sustained abuse commonly have difficulties distinguishing between particular occasions of abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments address these difficulties by reducing the number of occasions required to prove the offence. This helps to ensure perpetrators of persistent sexual abuse against vulnerable children overseas are not evading justice.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In another effort to hold Australian predators more accountable for sexual crimes against children overseas, the bill restricts the ability of offenders to escape culpability by claiming they were legally married to the child. Closing this loophole is crucial, as some countries permit girls as young as 10 years to marry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also strengthen the existing forced marriage offences to ensure they explicitly capture all marriages involving children under 16 years. Child marriage is a pernicious practice that seriously harms the development and wellbeing of victims, with disproportionate impacts on girls and young women. Children trapped in early marriages are often subject to physical and mental abuse, rape and forced pregnancy. The bill sends a clear message that this morally reprehensible practice will not be tolerated. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government is introducing safeguards to ensure the integrity of the superannuation system and streamline compliance with the superannuation guarantee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill introduces an employer shortfall exemption certificate for certain employees with multiple employers. Currently, employees can inadvertently breach the concessional contributions cap from compulsory contributions where they have multiple employers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure will allow certain employees to avoid this outcome by applying to the Commissioner of Taxation for an exemption certificate in relation to at least one of those employers. A certificate will mean that their employer does not have to make superannuation guarantee contributions for them for up to one year. It will also mean that employees are not forced to breach their concessional cap. Instead, these employees can choose to negotiate with their employer to receive the higher remuneration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be eligible for a certificate, an employee must be likely to have excess concessional contributions for the financial year and have at least one other employer who is required to make superannuation guarantee contributions for them in that year. This targets the measure to those employees likely to breach the concessional cap because they have multiple employers. It also ensures that employees still receive superannuation guarantee contributions from their employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill introduces reforms to further support the operation and integrity of the Superannuation Taxation Reform Package announced in the 2016-17 budget. These measures ensure our super system is fair, sustainable and used for its core purpose. The amendments improve confidence in the system by reducing the extent of tax minimisation and estate planning in superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments address the possibility of self-managed super fund members circumventing the cap on tax-free retirement phase assets through limited-recourse borrowing arrangements or non-arm's-length expenditures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill includes the outstanding value of limited-recourse borrowing arrangements in the total super balance of SMSF members who are at particular risk of entering into certain tax minimisation strategies. This measure will stop these members using LRBAs to circumvent the $1.6 million limit on non-concessional contributions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also extends the existing non-arm's-length income rules to capture non-arm's-length expenses. This will ensure that superannuation funds can't circumvent the contribution caps by using non-arm's-length expenditure to inflate their overall income—for example, by borrowing money from a member at a reduced interest rate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 to the bill improves the integrity of the tax treatment of concessional loans made to a tax-exempt entity that is privatised by removing inappropriate tax deductions which arise on the repayment of loan principal for certain privatised entities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 to the bill is an integrity measure that will deny deductions for some taxpayers for expenses associated with holding vacant land. These amendments will improve the integrity of the tax system by tightening the link between claiming deductions for holding vacant land and earning assessable income, and will apply to the 2019-20 income year and future years.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 to the bill will extend to family trusts a specific anti-avoidance rule that applies to other closely held trusts that engage in circular trust distributions.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 5 to the bill amends the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to allow the ATO to disclose to credit reporting bureaus the tax debt information of businesses that have owed the ATO at least $100,000 for more than 90 days and, importantly, have not effectively engaged with the ATO to manage their debt. This measure will encourage businesses to engage with the ATO and repay their debt in a more timely manner.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sport plays a significant role in the Australian way of life—each year 14 million Australians participate in some form of sporting activity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sport is also an important contributor to the Australian economy. As highlighted by the Boston Consulting Group's 2017 <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational </span><span style="font-style:italic;">review of A</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ustralian sport</span>, $35 to $47 billion of economic activity is generated by sport each year, equating to approximately two to three per cent of GDP, which is equivalent to the agriculture sector. Recognising the importance of sport to the Australian community, the Australian government invests more than $300 million to support high-performance sport and encourage greater participation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians have no tolerance for the corruption and manipulation of sport. In August 2017, the government commissioned the Review of Australia's Sports Integrity Arrangements (the Wood review), chaired by the Hon. James Wood AO QC, as part of the work being done to develop the National Sport Plan—Sport 2030.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wood review was published on 1 August 2018. It confirms Australia's position as a leader in addressing sports integrity threats, but cautions that Australia's sports integrity response will require ongoing vigilance to ensure Australian sport can be protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the Wood review found that sports are challenged by a range of mounting integrity threats, including the increasing sophistication and incidence of doping, the globalisation of sports wagering particularly through rapidly growing illegal online gambling markets, the infiltration and exploitation of the sports sector by organised crime, corruption in sports administration and growing participant protection issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sports integrity matters are now beyond the control of any single stakeholder.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The nature of sports corruption and manipulation is evolving at the fastest rate ever observed due to the immense commercialisation of sport and sporting organisations and accelerating technological advancement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These threats are complex, globalised and connected, forming a complicated threat matrix. To respond effectively, Australia must have a robust, comprehensive and nationally coordinated response across sports, governments, regulators, the wagering industry, law enforcement and other stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A key recommendation of the Wood review is that a National Sports Tribunal be established to address anti-doping and general sports disputes fairly, quickly and cost-effectively to ensure accessible natural justice for all parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wood review examined similar models overseas, including in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada and Japan, and found that Australia's sports dispute resolution mechanisms lagged behind. The Wood review underlined the need for such an entity in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why we introduced legislation into the previous parliament to fund a two-year pilot of the National Sports Tribunal which would allow refinement of its jurisdiction and operation, according to demand. Although that bill lapsed due to the recent federal election, we have taken that opportunity to undertake further consultation on and refinement of the bill being introduced today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently in Australia, some sports disputes are arbitrated in the first instance by tribunals run internally by individual sports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, most sports cannot maintain internal tribunals. Their only available forum for anti-doping rule violation disputes is the Swiss Court of Arbitration for Sport, which can be an expensive and time-consuming process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard from a number of sports about the challenges they face in dealing with disputes. Managing such disputes detracts from the core business of our sports: building a more active Australia and achieving sporting excellence. Integrity compromises detract from these goals and cause major reputational and other damage, especially when they occur during major sporting events.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Establishing the National Sports Tribunal will provide an effective mechanism to manage such issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is proposed the National Sports Tribunal will deal with two types of disputes: anti-doping rule violations and general disputes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Accordingly, the National Sports Tribunal will be comprised of three divisions:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The general division will hear other types of disputes which arise under the rules or policies of a sport, including in relation to code of conduct breaches and disciplinary matters, selection disputes, member protection issues and the like. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Sports Tribunal will be established by statute, rather than privately, to enable the tribunal to be given powers to inform itself, including by requiring the attendance of witnesses and the provision of documents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Sports Tribunal will be one of the few, if not the only, sports dispute resolution body worldwide that will have these powers, reaffirming the government's commitment to, and Australia's position as a leader in, protecting the integrity of sport.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is intent on providing participants in sport with a fair, efficient and cost-effective forum of the resolution of sports disputes. We are also focused on relieving the burden of managing complex and serious dispute resolution from sporting organisations so they can focus their time and resources on doing what they do best—supporting our high-performance athletes to excel and providing more opportunities for Australians to get active.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will amend the Aged Care Act 1997<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>to allow the movement of provisionally allocated residential care places from one determined aged-care planning region (region) to another.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal-National government (the government) is committed to ensuring all older Australians have access to high-quality aged care and services when they need it. Integral to this is supporting approved providers to make residential aged-care places ready for use as quickly as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has overarching responsibility for delivery of aged-care services across the country, as part of an end-to-end system covering both residential and in-home aged care. A key policy objective for the government is to ensure that residential aged care is available to those older Australians who require it as quickly as possible, and appropriately allocated to regions to address local needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through a competitive process, residential aged-care places are provisionally allocated to approved providers by the secretary of the Department of Health (the department) or a delegate in a region that has a demonstrated need for these services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Constructing aged-care homes is a difficult, time-consuming and expensive exercise. It takes on average 4.3 years for providers to acquire land, obtain planning approval and construct an aged-care home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following an allocation of places, providers can often have difficulties locating suitable land and navigating local government planning processes. It is not uncommon for suitable land to be located just outside a planning region, or for local councils to decide, for example, that a planned 120-bed aged-care home should only be 100 beds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In such circumstances, operationalising places in the current region may not always be feasible, but by moving them to another region the approved provider can often make them available to older Australians more quickly. This is not, however, permissible under the current legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments within this bill seek to amend the legislation to allow provisionally allocated residential aged-care places to be moved from one region to another, where a provider can demonstrate that the movement is in the interests of aged-care consumers and there is a clear need for places in the new region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also makes it clear that, in considering any such applications, the department will also consider the needs of the region from which it is proposed to transfer the provisionally allocated places. In particular, the department will ensure that this does not become a mechanism for moving residential aged-care places out of regional areas of high need to metropolitan areas with a lower need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This change is in the best interests of all older Australians and the broader community. It will remove a potential barrier to the community in accessing residential aged care, thereby aligning with the government's commitment to ensuring delivery of high-quality aged care and services when and where they are needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill was introduced into the previous parliament on 13 February 2019. Whilst it passed the House of Representatives, the bill lapsed as it was not debated in the Senate prior to the election being called.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="101351" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  I'll continue from where I left off last night, speaking against the repeal bill that's before us. These political battles—the debate we're having right now on the Migration Amendment (Repairing Medical Transfers) Bill 2019—are all playing out within a prism of fear that has trapped our politics for decades, and this government has shown no real leadership on this front. They continue an approach that is based on cruelty, and they are intent not only on allowing the status quo to go on and on and on indefinitely but even on reversing what little gains can be made by this parliament. But there is another way. We don't need to be trapped by fear. As a country, we can move past this. The medevac law was, and is, a first step in that new direction—in moving forward without fear. History has shown us the way forward. There are signposts to guide us out of this minefield.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 1970s and 1980s, when Australia welcomed refugees from South-East Asia, the vast majority came by plane after having their claims processed through regional agreements. I know it is possible to have a humane approach to people seeking asylum and to refugees. I know it's possible to end the division and the fear. I know it's possible to avoid having people being exploited by people smugglers. And all these goals are not mutually exclusive. I know that even beyond these goals Australia can be a global leader in response to the global refugee crisis. We just need that coordinated international effort, and we need to play a part in leading that effort. We can forge a better way forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And why? Well, because it's the right thing to do. It's our role to help end and alleviate suffering for millions, and to do that good on the global stage is inherently good, as a public good. But it's also because that by doing so we serve our own national interests—those national interests that are so important to us: to live in a region and a world that is safe and secure. If we want to live in that world, if we want that world, we must move beyond this toxic, fear based debate and step up and lead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I just want to say that there is no reason for the government to continue on this chosen path of fear. There is another way. They say we passed the medevac law here because we wanted to defeat the government. How cynical. No: I say to those on the government side, we passed this law back in February because we wanted to provide medical care for people who needed it, for people who are in our duty of care. And when Australians look back on this time they'll ask that question. Why are we having this debate now? And they will say that we should have been better than that. I believe that we are better than that and can be better than that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="175696" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  I would like to acknowledge the Ngunawal and Ngambri people whose land we meet on today, the elders past, present and emerging. May we work together to promote harmony and learning, and let us safeguard this land together for generations to come. I would also like to acknowledge the Gayemagal, the Gamaragal and the Borogegal, the First People of Warringah.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's an incredible honour to stand before the 46th Parliament as a representative of all of the people of Warringah—only the ninth person to do so, and the first woman. I acknowledge those who came before me: Sir Granville Ryrie, Sir Archdale Parkhill, Sir Percy Spender, Francis Bland, John Cockle, Edward St John, Michael MacKellar and Tony Abbott. All have placed their unique mark on Australia, and I thank them for their service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No matter where I have travelled in the world, I've always been incredibly proud of being born in Warringah. Warringah stretches across the cosy inlets of Mosman Bay, from the Clifton Gardens to the breakers of Freshwater, Curl Curl and Manly Beach, bushland of Killarney Heights, the cliffs of North Head to the calm waters of Neutral Bay. It spans harbour apartments with city views, cosmopolitan centres and family havens, bustling shopping centres and industrial zones, to unique and serene areas, like the Manly Dam War Memorial Park, from the heights of Seaforth and Allambie to the valleys of Manly Vale and Brookvale—the home of the mighty Manly Sea Eagles. We are surrounded on all sides by harbour and coastal waters or beautiful sprawling bushland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The natural beauty of Warringah is intertwined with its rich past and Indigenous history. Its first people were sturdy, pioneering and resourceful. Their way of life required resilience and endurance. They fished from bark canoes in Port Jackson, they gathered fruit on the ridgelines of Killarney Heights and they hunted in the woodlands of Forestville. Their success is evidenced by Warringah's over a thousand Indigenous sites, which include rock carvings, middens, ancient bush trails, campsites and meeting areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For over 20,000 years, the Guringai people were custodians of the country. Today, over 1,300 people with Indigenous lineage call Warringah their home. We celebrate their history and culture with the Gai-mariagal Festival, previously known as the Guringai Festival. The festival shines a light on the deep Indigenous knowledge of land—a knowledge that will be so important to a sustainable future in Australia. I hope that this parliament will go beyond the apology, accept the voice of our Indigenous people and find mutual respect, and accelerate the process of healing. There are so many gaps still to close.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Warringah's colonial history is replete with entrepreneurial endeavours that echo through to the present day. Its suburbs have variously been agricultural areas, whaling stations, tourist areas, mining sites, military bases and quite suburban spaces. Many of the suburbs still have founding-era buildings, pavilions, rotundas and depots; and intricate alcoves and sandstone facades. Our predecessors were pioneering and inventive. Many artisans, poets, architects and builders of the original Sydney came from Warringah, and we are grateful for their vision. Today, the electorate has become a hub of professionals in many industries, including hospitality, health services, finance and tourism, and is now blossoming as a hub of renewable energy and tech start-ups—the industries that will be the future of Australia's economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sport has also played a big part in our history, in defining our character and cultural identity. The people of Warringah have always appreciated the outdoors, flocking to sports on the weekend, whether it's playing for the Mosman Whales, the Manly Warringah Sapphires or the Manly Marlins; taking the board for a surf; running around our many fantastic tracks; or showing up to patrol at one of the many surf lifesaving clubs in Warringah, and we have been doing so for over 100 years. Mosman Rugby Club was established in 1893 and is one of the oldest Rugby Union clubs in Australia; and, notably, Manly surf lifesaving club is one of the oldest surf lifesaving clubs in the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sport has played a big part in my life. I started competing in pretty much every sport I could try my hand at from the age of four, from swimming, judo, windsurfing, ice skating and running to skiing. At 13, I watched the 1988 Winter Olympic Games, and I decided that I wanted to compete at a Winter Olympics for Australia. I gave up all other sports for skiing. I didn't worry about whether it was possible or too hard to make the Olympics. I first settled on the conviction that I wanted to strive towards that goal and, once committed to that goal, I set about making it happen. It was a long, hard and often lonely road, with many sacrifices, but ultimately so rewarding, as I took Australia to the peak of alpine skiing and added my small contribution to Australia's proud sporting history. I strongly believe that it is hard work, planning and resilience that brings about success, and urge all young Australians to dream big. I felt a huge sense of responsibility representing Australia at the Olympic Games, first as a 17-year-old schoolgirl and then, especially, when carrying the Australian flag into the closing ceremony in Nagano in 1988, after winning Australia's first individual medal at the Winter Olympics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I sat here on 2 July for the swearing-in of the 46th Parliament, I was struck by the absolute privilege and the responsibility that falls upon us in representing and serving the people of Australia to the best of our ability. While this may be a place of robust debate, it is time for a more respectful approach, and accountability. Trust in Australian politicians is at its lowest in a decade, and we can only reach our potential as a democracy if we believe in our institutions. As in sport, there can only be respect if you're playing by the rules. We impose legal standards on business to protect customers and consumers, but we fail to protect our voters with a legal minimum standard of truth in political advertising. This needs to change. We must also safeguard the freedom of the press and our national broadcaster. Without a free press, we cannot hope to preserve the civil liberties and freedoms past generations fought so hard to protect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In researching and reading many of this parliament's members' first speeches I was struck by how many grand statements and ideals are first made but then seem to disappear in the polarisation of party partisanship. It's time for more than just words. Governments have a duty to serve and to lead. It's time for fact based policy and sensible politics. Representing the best interests of all of the people must come above party partisanship and personal interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe Australia has always punched above its weight and never shied away from a challenge or doing its share. We live in a time where we are facing possibly our biggest challenge to date—to properly appreciate, respect and nurture our environment and evolve to a zero carbon economy. Our schoolkids are leading the way in pointing out that there is no second planet, no planet B. The government's own report tells us our emissions are still rising, and even our schoolkids know that we're not heading in the right direction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've listened to many here talk of their love for their families and their children and of their hopes for the future of their communities. When we and our children are sick, we trust in the doctors and the science to heal them. Many scientists from independent and varied fields of study have come to the conclusion that we must reduce our carbon emissions to have a hope of averting the worst consequences of climate change. Australia, especially in regional areas, is vulnerable to those consequences and will experience higher than average warming, leading to more severe weather events, from droughts and floods to bushfires and hurricanes. This will devastate productivity and way of life, regionally and nationally. When the consequences are felt, especially in the regional areas, all of Australia—including us city dwellers—stands together to help impacted communities, for example with drought relief funding, But, accordingly, the duty to prevent the worst from occurring also falls on everyone and cannot be ignored and dismissed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to ensure a prosperous, clean future for the next generations in all regions of Australia. There needs to be less short-termism and opportunistic policymaking and more long-term planning to futureproof our economy. History does not look kindly on leaders that fail to properly prepare a nation for the challenges ahead. Climate change impacts represent the greatest threat to our national security, our economy, our health and our environment. The cost of inaction is so great it is unthinkable that a coalition government driven with ideals of reducing national debt would consider burdening future generations with the greatest debt ever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is wrong to believe that concerns for our environment and climate are a Left issue. The world has a bipartisan history of acting on global environmental calamities. In the 1980s, a Conservative Thatcher government led the way in banning CFCs in the atmosphere. Thatcher's words to the UN General Assembly in 1989 are appropriate today:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We carry common burdens, face common problems and must respond with common action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The United Kingdom is continuing to lead the way, recently passing a motion in the House of Commons which recognised the climate change emergency. We can and must respond with the same determination and urgency. Two-thirds of Australians see global warming as a significant and pressing problem. It is time to reflect on this with bipartisanship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian diversity, inventiveness and can-do culture has served us well and will continue to do so. By recognising the industries of the future and investing in emerging clean technologies, we can provide jobs for regional Australia and ensure we are a 21st century clean-energy superpower. We have the most abundant natural resources in the world and the innovation and ingenuity to develop them. This parliament has the opportunity to provide the road map and transition plan to be ambitious and lead the way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge this 46th Parliament to be remembered for developing a comprehensive plan to decarbonise every polluting sector by 2050 and then putting it into action. In this plan, we need to identify the sectors that will be hard to decarbonise—like aviation, shipping, agriculture, and manufacturing—and support the agencies, like the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, by broadening their mandate to invest in these areas. If we can take an incremental view, we can break down the challenges ahead, one step at a time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I firmly believe that we are all, as individuals, accountable for our decisions and actions. It is time. Our time is precious and limited. Like many people in Warringah and all over Australia, I refuse to be part of the generation that had all of the facts but failed to take meaningful action. It's time to transition our economy and energy production. There's no need to be afraid of change. It is what we've always done: adapt and change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is built on amazingly brave and resourceful people. My own family history in Australia goes back on my father's side to the Second Fleet and on my mother's side to the early 1830s. These early settlers undertook long, arduous and often dangerous sea journeys, in cramped steerage accommodation on ships with varying degrees of seaworthiness, to a foreign country 13,000 kilometres away. They were leaving everything that was familiar and dear to them in the hope of a better life. Today's refugees are no different, yet we seem to have forgotten our own history and lost our compassion. My mother's family ultimately settled in Maitland and my father's family settled in Cessnock, via Western Australia and Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My family's relationship with Manly started in the 1920s, when my great-grand-aunts moved there. Seeing his sisters struggle to earn a livelihood, my great-grandfather prioritised his daughters' education, including that of my grandmother Phemie Faith Mallaby. It was important to have a formal university education. There has never been any question in my family that women are equal, capable and entitled to the same opportunities as men. I never discussed politics with my grandmother, yet she was the honorary treasurer of the Maitland branch of the Liberal Party until the day she died in 2007. I know she was incredibly proud when both my brother Zeke and I represented Australia at the Winter Olympics. I can only imagine how excited she would have been at my election to parliament, notwithstanding my being an Independent and defeating an ex-Liberal Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On my dad's side, my grandfather Jack Steggall was a Wallaby from 1931 to 1933, touring New Zealand and South Africa, before retiring to practise law. With my grandmother Ruby, eight years his senior and a formidable matron of a hospital, they settled in Cessnock, where Jack, also a lawyer, turned to playing and coaching rugby league. I'm incredibly grateful for having had many strong personalities in any family. My parents, John and Sue, have also achieved so much. My mother is an art historian and writer. My father has played rugby for the Norths and then Manly and practised law in Manly for over 30 years. The most important thing I learnt from them was to believe in myself and never be afraid to give something a go. You only regret when you don't try.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the achievements of past generations will be for nothing if we do not evolve our economy for the future and embrace our diversity. Some are fixated on just preserving the status quo, when we are capable of so much more. As Australians, we need to value and respect all of our people, no matter their background, gender, sexual preferences or religious beliefs. No one group has the right to disrespect or discriminate against another. This must be respected at all costs as this parliament makes decisions for the good of all Australians, irrespective of their faiths and beliefs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We live in a time of opportunity, with more technology than ever before, but we have serious health challenges and social inequalities. There's still a 14 per cent pay gap between men and women, and women are retiring with 40 per cent less superannuation. Child care needs to be more affordable to ensure equal participation in the workforce. Family and domestic violence is a major health crisis for women that impacts every area of Australian society, and it needs urgent attention. Nationally and in Warringah, mental health and rising suicide rates require a new approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to learn from local organisations. They are listening and working within our communities. We can offer more hope and care to our youth and older generations. As a mum of teenagers, I'm acutely aware of their concerns and worries. Our young people are our future, and I look forward to welcoming them to Parliament House and creating opportunities and a better Warringah for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud and humbled by the joy and excitement I have received from so many schoolkids in Warringah. A special shout-out to the El Shanditos and all the youths of Warringah. I encourage you to get involved with politics and the issues that matter to you. It is your future that is at stake.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my fellow parliamentarians in this the 46th Parliament of Australia: I thank you for your warm welcome and I look forward to working with all of you, on both sides of the aisle, as collectively we strive to make our nation an even better place over the next three years. Let our legacy as the 46th Parliament be that we were brave and ambitious, that we set both our standards and our goals at the highest level. I embrace that challenge and I hope you do too.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reflecting on my last 11 years at the New South Wales bar, I'm thankful to all my instructing solicitors, colleagues and mentors: Her Honour Dr Melissa Perry QC, Todd Alexis SC, Tim Hale SC, Kate Morgan SC, Justine Beaumont and Greg Johnston, to name but a few who have supported me and taught me so much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, my thoughts go to the most important people in my life and those without whom none of this is possible: my ultimate partner and support, my husband, Tim, and, better than any gold medal, my children Chloe, Rex, and Remy. I'm also so lucky to have bottomless support from my parents John and Sue, my brother and his family, Malcolm and Shelagh Irving and all my extended family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm deeply grateful to Louise Hislop, Anthony Reed and the most amazing team, who worked tirelessly over the four-month campaign, and a special thank you to the more than 1,400 volunteers who helped make this possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If there's one thing this campaign will be remembered for, it is the unbelievable resourcefulness and energy of a team of very talented women led by Kirsty Gold, Anna Josephson, Dof Dickinson, Julie Giannesini and Tina Jackson. Thank you also to Rob Purves, Mark Kelly, Rob Grant, Angus Gemmel and Rickard Garnell for your hard work and support.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that stood out—and still does if I look around the gallery today—is the passion of the people of Warringah to bring about a new era: moderates with a heart. It is hard to describe the excitement, enthusiasm and energy in Warringah in the last five months. This began as a true grassroots movement driven by passionate locals who care about our future. Over the last three years many diverse groups—grassroots movements—mobilised to start the discussion and really focus on how they wanted to be represented, what contribution they wanted to make to this parliament and what kind of future they wanted for their children and future generations. Voices of Warringah, Think Twice Warringah, the North Shore Environmental Stewards and VTO are just a few. And this can happen all over Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Warringah is a diverse place—one that, like Australia itself, has to accommodate the different needs, beliefs and aspirations of people. Our volunteers believe that striving for political change in Warringah could also offer Australia a more positive future and a defining purpose that goes well beyond traditional political differences. The volunteers, supporters and donors, many of them here today, have been amazing—people who have never campaigned before, some with low incomes and some with high incomes, some progressive and some conservative, and from many different walks of life but all united in their vision for a new era in Warringah.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I'm grateful to the people of Warringah for entrusting me with the responsibility of representing their views and concerns to this parliament. It's truly humbling. We all have a voice and the power to make a difference.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MURPHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:23</span>):  We meet today on the lands of the Ngunawal people. My electorate of <span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span> is on the lands of the Boonwurrung people of the Kulin nation. We recognise and support local Indigenous culture, history and people at the gathering place by the bay, Nairm Marr Djambana. I pay my respects to their elders, past and present, and to all traditional owners. I stand here today to pledge my support for the recognition of First Nations people in Australia's Constitution and the establishment of an Indigenous voice to parliament based on the Uluru Statement from the Heart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been quite a journey to this place for a public-school girl from Wagga. I grew up during the Hawke and Keating years, benefitting from the long list of economic, social and environmental reforms their government introduced. Their government was a Labor government who, like all Labor governments before and since, took seriously their core business of enlarging opportunities for those without power or resources. But what really inspired teenage me was the way Hawke and Keating also enlarged our national imagination about who we could be and the place we could take in the world. They made me believe in our democratic system because they demonstrated how that system could deliver good government and how good government could deliver a better future. They, and the values my parents instilled in me, also made me Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I was asked to imagine what, at the end of my parliamentary career, I would like to be able to look back on and say I was proud to have been a part of—what I would like to have achieved. It's a very long list, those who know me won't be surprised to hear, only some of which, you'll also be glad to hear, I'm going to have time to touch on today. But it does span initiatives in my local community, structural reforms to national systems and institutions, and, of course, Australia's role as a leader in our region and in the world. But, above all else, I would like to be able to say that I left Australian politics—Australian democracy—in better shape than when I joined it, that I was part of a generation of Australian politicians who worked to recover the public's faith in our democratic system and who strove to reharness politics as that vehicle for enlarging opportunities and enlarging our national imagination, and that we did so by rejecting politics based on fear and division, by refusing to see societal problems as weapons with which to wedge our political opponents and by choosing robust debates about ideas and solutions over personal attacks and petty judgements. It's what my community wants me to do. It's what Australians want all of us here to do. And, be in no doubt, it's what we have to do. At a time when less than half of all Australians are satisfied with the way democracy works and only one in five say they trust politicians, surely the alarm bells are ringing. There is too often a machismo about politics which mistakes aggressiveness for advocacy, which demands certainty and rejects reflection as weakness, and which is quick to judge and slow to forgive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This parliament is the cauldron of Australia's national conversation, and politicians are not just participants in it; we are its custodians, and we must do better. Of course, not everyone in this place shares the same political philosophy and we don't always agree on the way forward. Politics is a place where ideas should be contested. They should be contested with a passion. They should be contested fiercely, robustly and forcefully. There will be times when the behaviour, motivations and policies of our opponents should rightly be called out and criticised. But how we do that matters. When the participants in our body politic get so caught up in beating their opposition—in winning the daily argument at all costs—that they stop listening and striving to understand what others are saying, we are not just dumbed down; we are diminished. We are diminished in the eyes of the Australian people and we are diminished in our capacity to tackle the difficult challenges—challenges such as those posed to us by the Sustainable Development Goals, whose pin I'm wearing today, and the challenge of being the first generation to end poverty and the last generation to address climate change, challenges such as introducing a federal bill of rights so that complex, important national debates can occur within a comprehensive national human rights framework, and challenges that my community cares about, including preserving our environment, ensuring decent secure jobs for our children and protecting the egalitarian nature of our society. Meeting those challenges is going to take a willingness from all of us here to persist with complex debates over a sustained period—certainly longer than the 24-hour news cycle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the spirit of Louisa Dunkley, I am up for those debates. Although my electorate is named after her, Louisa Dunkley's story is not widely known to people, apart from those who know me or in some way came across my campaign. As the first woman to represent Dunkley, it's my responsibility and my pleasure to tell her story. It's also my hope that other people—girls and boys, women and men—will also find inspiration in Louisa and her achievements. Louisa Dunkley didn't come from particular wealth or privilege. After her father died someone had to provide for her family, so, in 1882, Louisa entered the Victorian Postmaster-General's Department as a junior assistant. Over the next decade she worked her way up to become a telegraphist at the Chief Telegraph Office. As her career progressed, so did her indignation at the unfair pay and conditions of her female colleagues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Louisa Dunkley was a worker, she was a feminist and, in 1895, she became a trade unionist. The Victorian telegraph union of the mid-1890s wouldn't admit women as its members and it certainly wouldn't advocate for their workplace rights, so Louisa and her female colleagues took the cause into their own hands and the Victorian Women's Post and Telegraph Association was born. On behalf of that association, Louisa went before the Victorian colonial public service classification board and advocated for women to be paid the same as their male colleagues. Her advocacy was described at the time as brilliant, and she won pay increases for the women of that office. Meanwhile, the men, whose union had refused to make submissions for fear of putting the colonial government offside, received pay cuts. Of course, not everyone was so pleased with that outcome. In an attempt to isolate her from her female colleagues and supporters, the masters of the Post and Telegraph Office transferred Louisa to a more remote workplace, but they didn't really think that through. She worked at the Post and Telegraph Office where the means of communication were pretty readily available. So, undaunted by opposition from those who resisted change and those who protected power, Louisa continued her campaign, attracting like-minded men and women alike to her cause.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1900, she gained endorsement at the first national congress of telegraph and post office associations to argue for equal pay in the soon-to-be formed federal Public Service. She also played an important role in uniting those associations into what later became Australia's first national Public Service union. So there is some synchronicity that I stand here today, not just as the first woman to represent Dunkley in the federal parliament but also as a proud member of the Commonwealth Public Service union. Under Louisa's leadership, two more years of letter writing, lobbying, pamphleteering and demonstrating—activities that many here will be familiar with—led to the inclusion of an equal pay provision in the Commonwealth Public Service Act 1902. It was a remarkable achievement at any time but particularly at that time. After securing that historic achievement, Louisa wrote these words:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… though at first we only asked for equal pay as an act of justice to those women … who had … been doing the same work as men, we now advocate it as the only solution … as to how to keep up the value of the work and provide fair opportunities for employment of both men and women in the future …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019, living in that future, we still have some way to go to achieve Louisa's aims. Across every occupation women are paid less than men, and the work which is predominantly done by women remains systemically undervalued. Just ask our early childhood educators and childcare workers what it's like to have to value yourself against a male comparator. And women continue to be under-represented in positions of leadership across all workplaces, including this one. I'm proud to be part of a political party which has taken real action towards rectifying that. Reforms that encourage sharing of parental leave, make child care more affordable and accessible and better integrate family and work life would also go a long way to redressing the imbalance. So, too, would properly valuing unpaid work—caring for family members, doing the housework—and making it perhaps a little less gendered. Louisa Dunkley understood it was work of real value. After both of their parents died, her sister took on responsibility for running the household—real work which Louisa believed deserved real pay, so every week, she split her pay packet with her sister. Louisa Dunkley lived and fought for her values, for fairness, for equality and for the power of collective action. We could all do much worse than follow in her footsteps.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I come to this parliament after a professional career that has spanned the law, public service and politics. As a solicitor, barrister and senior public defender, I have represented the damaged and the difficult, victims and perpetrators, the blameless and the blameworthy. At every turn, I have seen the corrosive effect that intergenerational disadvantage can have on people, families and communities. I have also seen the way the operation of the legal system can cause further distress and damage to people when they're at their lowest. This is true no matter what socioeconomic background you come from, but it's particularly true for those who already face other challenges in their lives. Last year, the Peninsula Community Legal Centre in my electorate provided over 9,000 legal services to people in need—people in my community struggling with mental illness, addiction, homelessness and family violence and breakdown.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are too many people where poor educational and economic opportunities first put them at risk of becoming entangled in the justice system, and then put up seemingly insurmountable barriers to getting out. Too often, before the kids with the fewest opportunities leave the tail end of our school system, they have already entered the front end of the justice system. Anyone who has worked in the justice system, criminal or civil, will viscerally understand when I say that justice cannot be left to the justice system alone. To really find justice in our society, to break the cycle of disadvantage and dysfunction, we need to take a holistic and long-term approach. We need to start by making sure our public education system and the educators who work in it have the resources and support they need to give every child the best start in life, no matter how much money their parents have. We need services—legal, social, health, employment and education—that are, to use a policy-boffin phrase, bottom up and joined up. We need a political climate and politicians who are prepared to champion the services and the needs of the people they serve. It's that task that motivated me to move from the law into politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to now talk briefly about my community of Dunkley. We are wealthy and poor. We're old and we're young. We're migrant and we're First Peoples. We're employers and employees. But we have a lot more that binds us than separates us. From the Pines to Mount Eliza, we are ambitious for our children. We are proud of where we live. We would like life to be just that little bit easier for us and for our neighbours. And we really, really love our dogs! We have a lot to be proud of, from our growing industrial and health and education precinct, a strong cultural sector based around the Frankston Arts Centre and the McClelland Sculpture Park and Gallery in Langwarrin, to a growing number of music and arts festivals, restaurants, cafes and craft breweries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We boast the Dolphins in the VFL, the Waves in the VNL and the Blues in the VBL. We have athletes and clubs participating from grassroots to elite in every sporting code you can name. Sport is more than a game to us, and those who know me know it's more than a game to me. It's one I like to win, but it is more than a game to me! When local clubs talk to me about why they need better facilities—a new clubhouse, lighting or change rooms for the women's team—they never talk about winning premierships. They talk about building pride and expanding opportunities. They talk about giving people a sense of belonging. They talk about supporting girls and women to be strong, brave athletes and to have the same opportunities and respect as the men. I love it, and it's why I'll always back them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While Dunkley is socioeconomically diverse, it's perhaps not one of Melbourne's most multicultural areas. However, if you wander down to the magnificent Frankston Foreshore on a summer weekend, you'll find hundreds of people from dozens of cultures all with their picnics and barbecues. They have flocked to Frankston to share in a patch of our coastal paradise. It's a site of pure joy and it's a symbol of modern Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also a community that cares deeply about the environment—our beaches, our bushlands, our green wedges. The first member for Dunkley, Bob Chynoweth, was a champion of the environment in the Hawke government. I intend to uphold Bob's legacy as we face up to the challenges of climate change and the loss of biodiversity. Chris Crewther represented Dunkley in the last term of this parliament and, before him, Bruce Billson was Dunkley's main cheerleader and advocate for 20 years. I want to acknowledge their contributions to our community today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For all of our strengths, Dunkley does face local education, health and social challenges. But we're a community rich with talent and compassion and with people who are using those traits to drive initiatives for local and wider benefits. Hands On Learning, founded 20 years ago by Russ Kerr at Frankston High School and now in more than 100 schools across the state, has been recognised as one of the world's top 100 innovations in education. It should be in every school in the country with disadvantaged or disengaged kids. Backing in the vision of local researchers and medical professionals, Peninsula Health and Monash University obtained bipartisan support at the last election to establish, in Frankston, a national centre for research and clinical trials to support positive ageing and rehabilitation, mental illness and addiction. I'm so excited to be a part of seeing that vision come to fruition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cam and James at Frankston Foundry have cultivated an exciting innovation ecosystem, and they have an ambition to make Frankston the nation's leader in med tech innovation. I have no doubt that with the support of the community and their new federal member for Dunkley they will succeed. Project O and the Colour of Hope are programs working with schools, in Frankston North and Karingal, to give young women and men confidence and life skills through visual, digital and performing art.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Women's Spirit Project has empowered women from across the electorate to change their lives through exercise and self-awareness. Mums Supporting Families in Need do exactly that, distributing donations stored in a warehouse in Carrum Downs to kids and parents across the Peninsula. Guru Glenn—self-named—and That's The Thing About Fishing give disadvantaged and disabled kids the chance to experience fun and friendship. These initiatives and so many more reflect a community that is stepping up to take responsibility, and it's my absolute privilege to walk alongside them, to be their voice in this parliament and to fight to get them the support and the recognition they deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2011 Rod Glover, my husband, and I were sold up, packed up and moving to San Francisco with big plans for work, life and adventure. Just days before we were to board the plane, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. On one view: confirmation that Murphy's law is real! But looking at it from another perspective, we were lucky. We had strong, loving families and friends. We had the resources that come with professional careers. We could afford and access the best quality health care. I am acutely aware that this is not everyone's story and that it should be. I pay tribute to the team of dedicated healthcare professionals who looked after me then and the ones who look after people every day, day in, day out, when they need it the most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be frank: cancer sucks. Don't kick me out for unparliamentary language! It changes the way your body feels and it changes the way you feel about your body. The treatments can make you sick. Sometimes you're scared. Sometimes you're angry. In my experience, you're often both at the same time. You worry about how your family and your friends are coping. You value their support but you resent the fact that you need it. And for too many people, on top of all of this, is the worry about how to pay the bills if you can't work, about who's going to look after the children while you're getting treatment, how you're going to get to and from your opponents—sorry, appointments; cancer is your opponent—and so it goes on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, though, two good things came out of it all. The first was the decision to make Dunkley, where Rod grew up and his family lived, home. It was the best decision we ever made. The second was the reminder that life can be fragile and we'd better make the most of it. So when the opportunity arose I put myself forward as the ALP candidate for Dunkley for the 2016 election, notwithstanding it then had a margin of 5.6 per cent and had been held by the Liberal Party for 20 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I now know, cancer is not just indiscriminate, it's sneaky. Two weeks ago, a week after being sworn in as the member for Dunkley, I received the unexpected news that my cancer had returned. You might say, Murphy's law strikes again. But my mother, Jan, who is a Murphy by marriage, not birth, and therefore able to adopt a less pessimistic personal motto, would say: everything happens for a reason. I am neither unique nor alone in the fight that I am about to take on. Cancer Australia estimates that in 2019 just over 19,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 145,000 Australians will be diagnosed with some form of cancer. I am neither unique nor alone, but I am someone who has a platform that can be used to benefit others. And as long as the people of Dunkley continue to vote for me to represent them in this place, I intend to use it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to start by saying this today. Ladies, check your breasts! Men, stop ignoring what your body's telling you. Fellow members of this parliament, listen to the experts who warn that the promise of universal health care is under threat. Commit to the reform and funding that our health system needs and do whatever is required to ensure that Australia trains, retains and invests in the healthcare professionals and researchers who make our system great. We owe it to our community to do that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many are here today to share this day with me—family, friends from university, from squash, from the law. I don't know why everyone always laughs about squash. It is an amazing game. We boast the best female athlete in the world in Heather McKay, and there's a world champion sitting up there, Vicki Cardwell, watching us today. So stop laughing at my sport!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm just going to start that bit again. Many are here today to share this day with me—family, friends from university, from squash, from the law and from the ALP, and I know many other people would be here if they could. I can't name you all, but I know that you know who you are and I know that you know how much you mean to me and that my life would not have been, and will not continue to be, as rich and as fortunate if it wasn't for all of you. I am going to say, though, that Clementine, Joss and Pippa: it's so excellent you are here today. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to single out my parents, Bob and Jan—they're here with my sisters Jodi and Penni and my awesome niece Ambryia representing Oliver, Ingrid, Bridget, Saana and Kyomi. Mum and Dad, public school teachers, educators and sporting tragics taught us to make the most of every opportunity in life and they taught us about the unparalleled importance of education. My parents are the two most humble, principled and selfless people I have ever met, and anything I have ever achieved is because of them. Jodi and Penni, I love you and I'm proud of you. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very fortunate to have shared the last 20 years of my life with my husband, Rod. Together we've travelled, made good friends—great friends—spent endless amounts of time talking and arguing about ideas and have watched every single political drama and BBC police procedural ever made. He won't let me tell the story about how we met. Rod is compassionate, he's brilliant, he's stubborn and he's silly. He's my most constructive critic, my most loyal supporter and my greatest friend. I wouldn't be standing here without him and I wouldn't want to. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very grateful as well for the love and support of Rod's mum, Betty, Gary, Donna and Debbie and our whole extended family clan. I've also been very fortunate in my life to have bosses who are also mentors and friends. Duncan Kerr and Robert Stary, who are both here in the gallery today, and Brendan O'Connor, who is seated behind me. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also had the support of Labor colleagues that I value deeply and admire—my great and awesome friend Melissa Horne, who's now a cabinet minister in the Andrews government, Mark Dreyfus, Paul Edbrooke, Sonya Kilkenny, Julian Hill and so many other people that I would name if only time permitted. To everyone who worked on and supported the Dunkley campaign—particularly Sue Heath and Peachy—my local branch members, my volunteers, all of my union comrades, my friends, thank you so much. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking around this chamber, at the gallery, at the people I have the privilege to work with and beside, and knowing that there are people who are watching this at home, I am struck yet again by the awesome privilege and responsibility that has been bestowed upon me. I am humbled by the confidence that my community has shown in me. I will work for all of you each and every day, at home and in Canberra. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="279991" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:54</span>):  On the foreshore of Port Macquarie town green, adjacent to Lady Nelson Wharf, sits an oversized bronze statue of Australia's first Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton. The figure sits staring out over the Hasting River with a backdrop of the Banda Banda mountain range. Observers might be forgiven for thinking that the statue was contemplating what might have been but for the selfless actions of one man, Francis Clark. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Frank Clark, who had a surname synonymous with Kempsey, was a surveyor, draftsman and explorer of our great region. He was also the member for Hastings and Macleay between 29 May 1893 and 7 September 1898, when he chose to put his nation before himself. Very few know that, in the July of 1898, Edmund Barton was defeated in the election for the seat of King, putting the progress and formation of the Federation in danger. Recognising that Barton was essential to forward the cause, Clark, on 7 September 1898, resigned his safe seat as member of Hastings and Macleay and took up the campaign for Barton and the Federation. So, on 23 September 1898, Edmund Barton was declared the newly elected member for Hastings and Macleay, and the rest, as they say, is history. On Christmas Day 1900, Barton was appointed Australia's first Prime Minister and, on 1 January 1901, people celebrated the Federation of Australian states. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a speech by Edmund Barton at a meeting at the Theatre Royal in Kempsey he said there was 'not in the whole of the records of this country a more chivalrous act of self-sacrifice than that which Mr Clark performed in the name of Australia'. He later described Mr Clark's actions as, 'noble self-sacrifice'. Following Federation, in March of that year Clark was elected as the first member for the new federal seat of Cowper, and today I recognise him, not only for being the first federal member of Cowper but more so for his selfless act for a nation. Today I am honoured to give my maiden speech as Cowper's 9th member, but its first Kempsey-born member—something I'm extremely proud of. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that the electorate of Cowper is the jewel in the crown of the Australian eastern border. Stretching from Port Macquarie to Coffs Harbour, adjoined by the many magnificent beaches, where I had a misspent youth, the chain of all three picturesque valleys of the Macleay, Bellinger and Nambucca are all watched over by the beautiful Dorrigo plateau. These are the traditional lands of the Birpai, Djangadi and Gumbaynggirr people, whose connection goes back for tens of thousands of years. Today I pay my respects to all their people, past and present. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Three things have forged my character that I can stand here today confident that I am able to represent all of the constituents of Cowper. The first was my father, John Conaghan. My father was born in Balmain in the early years of the Great Depression and, like all other Australians during that time, struggled significantly. His father passed away when he was only 16 years old, leaving him and his three siblings to work together to provide for the family. He was fortunate that he was blessed with intelligence, which he embraced, putting himself through medical school while working to make ends meet. The harshness of his formative years never left him. He always remembered where he had come from. He was an old-school doctor with a bedside manner no longer seen, a gentle man with empathy, compassion and a social conscience. He worked six days a week and, on Sundays after mass, he would go to the hospital to do his rounds, quite often with five children in tow. The only time that was sacrosanct was when his beloved Tigers were being televised. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My father was deeply but privately religious. He despaired at times at man's inhumanity to man, particularly the aged, who he believed should be treated with dignity in their final years, not discarded as a burden on society. In this regard, he was right. Almost 30 years since his passing, the aged-care system is bowing under the weight of demand, and residents are all too often treated as a number on a ledger to be measured in profit and loss. The need for a royal commission only validates his decades-old fear. I am pleased, however, that this government has taken steps in recent times to address aged care with record funding. However, more needs to be done. With 27 per cent of residents over 65 in Port Macquarie alone, with similar figures throughout Cowper, we must prepare now for their future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My father worked as a doctor for almost 30 years in Kempsey. He was a general practitioner, obstetrician, surgeon, gynaecologist and paediatrician, just to name a few. During my campaign, I was complimented in a most peculiar way when a constituent told me, 'I don't normally vote for your side. But considering your father delivered all of my six kids, I suppose I better.' Those types of comments were very familiar during the campaign: 'Your father delivered me,' 'He saved my life after I came off my bike,' or, 'He was good to us when mum died.' He left three messages: have integrity and always be humble, work hard to get ahead and remember that there are those less fortunate than you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Humility and integrity are the cornerstones of leadership. For far too long in this country, politics has been infused with celebrity, self-interest and ego, achieving only division throughout parties, government and the nation. I do not discriminate with this comment, and it's one of the reasons I stand here today. Having said that, I believe that that time has now come to a deserved end and the interests of this nation are once again in the forefront of the minds of those who lead it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second principle—work hard to get ahead—is an age-old motto in Australia. It's the ethos of those who lived here for many generations and of the people who migrated here pre and post the great wars. People like my father-in-law, Joseph Kovach, who came here after World War II and was sent to a Cowra migrant camp. Not deterred, he did as so many others did and worked hard to build a life and make Australia and its diversity what it is today. I had my first job at 13, cleaning the grounds and facilities of Kempsey swimming pool. My second job was pushing trolleys at Woolies at the age of 15. Australia is still a land of great opportunity for those who want to get ahead, regardless of class, race or region. The advancement of technology, science and industry enables our talented younger generation to continue the way, domestically and internationally, through innovative ideas and the ability to think outside of the box. Those Australians who wish to work hard and get ahead must also know that they will be supported by a strong government to achieve their goals and initiatives, a strong government who enables first-class education, facilities and programs through funding and support. This, of course, can only be done with a strong economy and a fiscally responsible government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My father's third message was to remind myself that there are those who are less fortunate than us. My father's social conscience, no doubt enhanced by his Hippocratic oath, was strong. As a doctor in regional Australia, he knew the disadvantages that country people faced. He was also acutely aware of the disparity in health for our Indigenous people, something that I am sad to admit remains. Never did he turn away a person at our front door, a parent with a sick child, a trauma victim or an elderly person. He was often paid in kind or in produce, which was the country way. I often recall my mother lamenting, 'John, we can't pay the bills in chokos.' My point is that we, as a government, have a responsibility to look after those less fortunate than us and to show compassion to those who genuinely need help. But when I speak to the constituents of Cowper, the vast majority do not want a handout; they want a hand up. I recognise that the best form of welfare is a job, and I acknowledge that over 1.3 million jobs have been created since the coalition has been in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, this does not account for the 20.3 per cent youth unemployment in Coffs Harbour—the second highest in the country and almost double that of Port Macquarie, only 153 kilometres away. I have, since my election, formed a committee to develop a platform for a youth summit in months to come. However, I call on this government to increase the recent announcement of 10 youth employment hubs across the nation to include a further one in Coffs Harbour to address this ongoing issue immediately for the youth of Coffs Harbour and the benefit of the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second influencing factor is my 12 years in the New South Wales Police Force. I unashamedly say they were the most difficult, confronting and emotionally exhausting years of my life. They were also the best. Nothing could prepare me for the experiences faced by police on a daily basis. The same could said about all emergency services personnel around Australia. Death was far too familiar. In my three years in Kempsey, I saw countless fatalities on the Pacific Highway and country roads, and tragic accidents on farms and private property. When I see projects such as the Coffs Harbour bypass, I see more than the convenience of missing 14 sets of lights; I see a safer journey for the millions of Australians and tourists who will drive it each year. I commend this government for its continued commitment to funding this vital piece of infrastructure. I also saw: the willingness of one human to murder or inflict pain upon another for no reason at all; the proliferation of child sexual assault and exploitation material; domestic violence and its ugliness; and, probably saddest of all, mental health and suicide, particularly youth suicide. In this regard, I'm again sad to say that, in my electorate, youth suicide far exceeds the national average, if any average were ever acceptable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following my time in Kempsey, I was transferred, as a detective, to serve as an undercover operative in the Drug Enforcement Agency—a unit of only six operatives at any one time throughout the state of New South Wales. Sporting a new persona, long hair, three earrings and a look that morphed between grunge surfy and eastern suburbs sect, depending on the job, I spent two years away from my family infiltrating criminal organisations. In conjunction with states, territories and Federal Police, I gathered information, purchased large quantities of illicit drugs and prepared briefs of evidence to secure the arrests and successful prosecution of criminals and organisations. In hindsight, the significance of the work was lost on me as a 25-year-old, as too was the intensity and the danger. The tenure of two years was fixed for this very reason. Many failed to reach tenure. Many left, having spent two years living in or on the periphery of the criminal underworld, to re-enter mainstream policing with a confused caution towards police in what could only be described as a pseudo-Stockholm syndrome. I certainly fell into this category. However, through the support of good mates, I found my centre and continued in an investigative capacity at the same time as studying law. I later transferred to the prosecuting branch, where I remained for four years before resigning to pursue a career in law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not raising my policing career for dramatic effect. I do so for two reasons. Firstly, we cannot wane on our war on drugs, nor can we accede to a minority to consider legalisation through legislation. Our communities are awash with the catastrophic effects of this poison: families torn apart and displaced; unemployment; violence; robberies; and break-and-enters. The enormous and obvious consequence on the health and mental health systems is palpable, not to mention the effect on those who work within those systems. Our rural and regional communities should not be afraid to leave their homes or, worse, be afraid to remain in them in the knowledge that users don't think twice to break in. We must continue not only to protect our borders but to embark on a strategic national approach of education and prevention for our youngest generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I spoke of the difficulties of the job. I'm lucky that I came out relatively unscarred. This is not the case for so many emergency personnel. Year after year, I have seen my former colleagues fall by the wayside with post-traumatic stress disorder, simply to be forgotten or discarded—made to fight the system to receive the care they require, not to move on but simply to survive. Many do not. As much as 20 per cent of emergency workers are impacted by PTSD. Between 2001 and today, 68 serving police officers across the country have died by suicide. This does not take into account those who have left the force; nor does it take into account any other emergency service organisation, past or present. These are the people who serve and protect us. We as a government must do much more to serve and protect them. This cannot be passed off as a state issue. We must work collaboratively as a government to do all we can for those who put themselves in harm's way for us. But, as I have said, those days were the greatest days of my working life. Only working under such conditions can great camaraderie come. I have forged lifelong friendships through my time in the police, two of whom—my closest mates, Craig Murray and Dave Newham—are in the House today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last of my experiences that hold me in good stead to stand in this House is my 18 years in law, not for the fact that I've practised law and have appeared as an advocate most days in court, although I recognise that this has and will continue to serve me well, but more so because I ran a practice, a small business, for over 16 years. I know what it is to employ people, to pay wages, to pay tax, and I understand how hard small business can be. Small and medium businesses are the backbone of regional and rural Australia. Around 4.8 million people currently work for small business. Without small business, there would be no regional Australia. Whether it is in trade, agriculture, retail or professional services, these are the people that provide the jobs—businesses like Faircloth Reynolds in Coffs Harbour; Expressway Spares in Port Macquarie; or the iconic Kempsey cafe, Lou's Cafe. These are the people and businesses that I will ensure I support because I understand how difficult it can be and how vital they are for the survival of our towns. I understand the significance of the small business tax rate being its lowest since the 1940s. I understand that it can mean putting on another employee or expanding, or perhaps rewarding yourself for the hard work and countless hours.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many I need to thank—firstly, my wife, Ilona, who I met under an assumed name—she was one of the good guys!—with my mullet, earrings and goatee. She has been able to overlook my deficiencies in looks and character, and has been by my side by over two decades. Opposites do attract. My wife has the personality and warmth that at times I may lack, often being referred to as 'Captain Grumpy' by my friends and colleagues. You have provided me with loving, quiet counsel when needed, whilst at the same time raising our two sons, rarely without a smile and never with a bad word about someone else. I cannot thank you enough. So, in front of this whole chamber, I say this to you: you can now have that new kitchen! And I love you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my boys, Hugh and Hamish, you're never too old to give your dad a hug. Be humble, work hard and you will get ahead. And remember, there are always those who are less fortunate than you. I love you and I'm proud of you both. I thank my mum and my siblings—Paul, Teresa, Margaret, Louise and Matthew; yes, we were a Catholic family—as well as my brother-in-law, Tony, for your support not just during the campaign but over the years, and Grant Brady SC for your wise counsel over the past 18 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would not be here but for the enormous efforts of the National Party members and volunteers, my campaign team, booth captains, corflute kings and all those who stood on prepoll and election days—all too many to name; however, all deserving of recognition in their own right. I have a list of their names, 611 in total, and I seek leave to table the same in gratitude for their efforts.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr CONAGHAN:</span>
                  </a>  I thank my predecessor, Luke Hartsuyker, for his 18 years of diligent service to this country, and I wish him well for his future. Similarly, I thank the former member of Coffs Harbour Andrew Fraser for his faith in me and his efforts during my campaign. Thank you to the Deputy Prime Minister, Michael McCormack, for your numerous visits throughout the electorate of Cowper. Your support and advice only strengthened my resolve to be here today. In that regard, I also recognise the vast assistance of Damian Callachor from your office, who took many late night and early morning calls. Similarly, I thank the Nationals Deputy Leader, Bridget McKenzie. You are not only fitter than me but you are also a better shot. I also thank Prime Minister Scott Morrison for his visit to Cowper. It showed my constituents that he is a Prime Minister for all Australian people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to the member for Port Macquarie, Leslie Williams, and her chief of staff, Terry Sara; my campaign manager, Joshua Hodges; Noel Atkins, FEC; state and deputy directors, Ross Cadell and Tom Aubert; and also the recently retired Bede Burke and John 'Wacka' Williams for imparting straightforward, no-nonsense advice. I thank my co-campaign manager, long-time friend and now chief of staff, Matt Field. A difficult campaign was made somewhat easier knowing that you had my back all the way. Starting kindergarten together has its advantages. And, lastly, I thank all constituents of Cowper who have put their faith in me to represent their best interests. I will endeavour to repay your trust to the best of my ability.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, some seek to define us by our maiden speech. I want to be defined no more by this than I am by one arrest, one prosecution or one case. I hope that I will be defined, in time, by the totality of what I have achieved for the people of Cowper, and I thank you for your indulgence.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M3C" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  The Migration Amendment (Repairing Medical Transfers) Bill 2019 has a really simple proposition. The government is putting forward the basic idea that if you're sick you shouldn't be able to get medical treatment. That's what this government is saying to all of the people whom Australia has locked up in prisons or on prison islands because they've committed no crime but have done nothing more than come here and try to seek our help, often fleeing war, trauma and persecution. They've come here, and the Australia government, under successive governments, under a bipartisan policy, has made them sick. It has locked people up in indefinite detention when they have committed no crime. It has said to young children, 'Even though you have done nothing wrong, you are going to spend your future unable to live freely and play like every other child does.' When you do that to people, it makes them sick. We've been told that time and time again, under a Liberal government and under a Labor government. This policy of offshore indefinite mandatory detention breaks people. It breaks them to the point where children have tried to kill themselves. We've had reports of people trying to set themselves on fire. That is what we have done to people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The health crisis in these camps is, as I say, at breaking point. If you live in Australia and you are so sick that you set yourself on fire or you consider taking your own life, there is help available to you. If you break your leg, there is help available to you. Most people in this country have no problem with the proposition that even prisoners who get sick are entitled to medical treatment. Yes, they've committed a crime and, yes, they're serving a sentence, but that's no reason to also say that if you get sick you can't get medical treatment. At the end of the day, people are human beings, and there's a basic principle that we have—or that we should all have—for each other, which is that if you get sick, no matter who you are, you are entitled to the treatment that will get you better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That wasn't happening for people who were on Manus or Nauru or in detention. What was happening was that people were getting incredibly sick—as I say, to the point where they would consider taking their own lives. They were getting so sick, and because this government, following the principles set down by previous Labor and Liberal governments, was saying, 'You're not allowed to live in Australia. We're going to put you offshore, out of sight, out of mind,' they were in places where you couldn't get the kind of help that people need, so bad was their health and so poor in many instances was the medical treatment that was being given to people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So people were crying out, saying, 'Give us the treatment we need to help us get better.' They had some friends and some advocates here. Groups like the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, the Human Rights Law Centre and many doctors and lawyers said, 'Okay, if the government's not going to give them the help that they need and deserve, then they should be brought to Australia to be given that help.' And every time they tried to make that happen, this government and this minister stood in their way and forced them to go to court to get basic medical treatment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just think about that for a moment. This government, this home affairs minister, has overseen them in a prison or in detention where, by definition, it helps break them to the point where they get sick. When they get sick and someone says, 'Give them medical treatment,' the government says, 'No. You go to court. Make us give them medical treatment.' People were going to court, and people were getting the medical treatment that, finally, they needed, but with no help from this government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Australian people found out about this, they said, 'There's something wrong here. There is something wrong if we are not giving people the medical treatment they deserve.' So in the last parliament we passed a bill that had a very simple proposition: if you get sick you're entitled to medical treatment, especially if you're under Australia's care, even if you're living in detention—especially if you're in detention. The bill that was passed had a lot of safeguards in it. Did it go as far as I wanted or the Greens wanted and end offshore detention? No. Did it say everyone should be processed here in Australia? No. We didn't have support from Labor or Liberal on that one, because they all agree on offshore detention. What it did do was say that if you're sick you can be brought here to get the medical help you need. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite all the rhetoric from the government, the people who were brought here still remained in detention while they were here. It's not like they got brought here and let out. I say that's what should happen if they're genuine refugees, but it doesn't. They got brought here and were kept in detention while they got the help they needed. And the minister still retained the power to step in if there was a security threat issue. In every other instance, if independent doctors said, 'No, they need medical help,' they were entitled to get it. That legislation passed, because it was the right thing to do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to the former member for Wentworth, Kerryn Phelps, who worked with the crossbench to lead the charge. I want to acknowledge the work of the former opposition leader, the member for Maribyrnong, as well because it did take guts to stand up and do that in the face of what we knew would be an onslaught of misleading statements and untruths from the government and the opposition. And, of course, it came. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For one moment, there was an attempt to wind back this bipartisan policy, and I pay tribute to the members of the crossbench and the Labor Party who worked together to make that happen. I know there are a number of people who worked very hard on this over a period of time. And the good news is, it was working. After this bill got passed we saw sick people getting the help they needed, and what the numbers bore out is what we feared all along—there weren't security threats. These people didn't have security threats hanging over their heads. There was no reason to deny them medical help. What we found was that when the independent doctors said, 'No, someone needs help,' most of the time the minister agreed and they were brought here. So we didn't have to go through this tortuous court process. We didn't need to have the minister saying, 'I'll only give you treatment if you can go and convince a judge.' No. If a doctor says you need treatment, you get it. And people were getting it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the people who were fronting up and had doctors saying, 'This person is so sick they need treatment,' in the first instance, 80 per cent of the time the minister agreed. The minister agreed and said, 'Yes, they need to come here.' Gone was this appalling and unjustifiable use of public money to keep sick people sick—all the lawyers and the clogging up of the court system by this government blocking legitimate claims. Eight out of 10 times, the minister looked at it and said, 'Under this new law, actually it's right; they should come here and they should get help.' There were not floods, as the minister and the government might have you believe—floods and floods of the new independent panel that was put in by the minister overriding the minister's decision. In fact, there have only been eight instances where the minister has been overridden. This tells you that, by and large, the people who are getting help under this legislation are people who need it. They are sick people and, eight out of 10 times, the minister agrees they're sick, and so they get the help they need without having to go to court. That is the law now, and this government wants to change it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government wants to go back to the old way of doing things where, even if the minister agrees that you're sick, you have to go to court, and the minister and the government will fight you with all the vast resources of the Australian government. They will fight you and fight you and fight you. If you get sick and die along the way, so be it; we don't care. This system is working. It is getting help to the people who need it. They are getting the treatment that they need, and this government wants to deny that to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have a question to answer in Australia. Regardless of where you stand on whether you think offshore detention is right—whether you think it's right to keep people locked up for not having committed any crime—we now have to deal with the very obvious fact that under this government's watch there are now hundreds of people who are sick because the government has made them sick. What are we going to do with those people? Are we going to say they are not entitled to medical help, which is what this government wants to do, or are we going to allow this legislation to stay in place so that they can just get the help that they need? Obviously the government doesn't care whether sick people get worse or die. It's quite happy to leave them in conditions where they don't get the medical care they need and in fact are going to make them sicker. It's quite obvious the government doesn't care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this bill passes this place—unless this government has a change of heart, for which you need a heart in the first place—and goes to the Senate, I say to all the members of the Senate: by rejecting this bill, you are not posing a security risk to Australia. By knocking this bill back, you are not changing the government's border protection policies. I'd love it if the medevac bill changed the government's border protection policies, but it doesn't. It's not my preference, but, if you believe in offshore detention, indefinite detention and all of those things, you can still knock this bill back, because this bill does nothing for Australia's security. All this bill does is say it's going to be okay from now on for the minister to dip his hand into the public purse, take money that could be going to schools and hospitals and use it to go to court to stop sick people from getting treatment. That's what the government's asking for. The government is asking for the right to use public money to stop sick people getting treatment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, no-one agrees with that. That's why the medevac bill passed both houses of parliament last time. It's why the Australian public thought it was a very good idea. I urge members of this place but especially members of the Senate: whatever your perspective on those broader issues, keep in place a law that is working. We know it's working. We know people are getting the help that they need. Allow that to continue to happen, because, otherwise, if you vote with the government on this, you are voting to make sick people sicker unnecessarily and you're voting to say it doesn't matter if someone as a result of all of this ends up with permanent illness, ends up with damage or decides to take their own life, because that's what has been happening. I plead with this place and with the other place to leave the law intact and to reject this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEARNEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:35</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Migration Amendment (Repairing Medical Transfers) Bill 2019, though I take umbrage at that title, because nothing needs to be repaired when it comes to the medevac legislation. It is working exactly as it should—getting sick refugees the health care they need. The policy of indefinite detention is making them sick, so if anything needs repairing it's that policy. If anyone needs repairing, it's the traumatised people this government is stranding on those islands for political gain. If any one thing needs repairing, it is our national psyche that has had to cope with the burden of conscience this horrible policy is inflicting on us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my first speech to this House, I referred to that damage on our national psyche and I said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We must, as a priority, move the asylum seekers off Manus and Nauru to permanent resettlement and ensure that indefinite detention never happens again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My commitment in this House is to the cause of humane refugee policy. It is to foreign policy and foreign aid that proactively supports people as they flee conflict.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have worked every day to honour that commitment. It is why I was proud to work alongside my Labor colleagues, the indefatigable refugee sector and the crossbench on the medevac legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's inconceivable that the parliament, through legislation, had to force the Liberal government to get sick people, including children, to health care. Let me repeat that: the medevac legislation exists because this government was refusing to provide health care to refugees and asylum seekers when they needed it. They are in our care. They are our responsibility. They are suffering because of this government's policies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, we saw a collapsing and dire health situation for refugees and asylum seekers on Manus and Nauru. Anyone who heard tragic accounts from the UNHCR, Medecins Sans Frontieres or the ASRC would be left in no doubt whatsoever that the refugees and asylum seekers who are detained on Manus and Nauru are sick because of their indefinite detention. I thank the refugee sector for all the hard and wonderful work they do. It is the hopelessness and helplessness of their situation which causes the high incidences of psychological issues from depression and anxiety to the incredibly heartbreaking cases of resignation syndrome and suicide. It should never have come to this. These are people who sought our protection, not illegally but with the full recognition of international conventions of people seeking asylum. Enough is enough. The cruelty of the Minister for Home Affairs and his government is despicable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor opposes the repeal of the medevac legislation. The Minister for Home Affairs has taken pains recently to trash the reputation of the medical panel involved in assessing the applications for medical evacuation. He has vigorously argued that two doctors from Nimbin can force the government to bring people from Manus or Nauru to Australia. I'm not sure why the minister is particularly offended by doctors in Nimbin, but the fact is that the panel includes some of Australia's most respected doctors, including the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer and the Surgeon General of the Australian Border Force. These doctors were appointed by the minister himself. I feel they need a direct apology. They are doing exactly what they are charged with: assessing the applications for evacuation and the process is working. It is saving lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe the process has seen 96 evacuations, of which 88 were actually approved by either the Minister for Home Affairs or the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs. Only eight times have they overruled the minister, and none of the objections by the minister were actually on national security grounds—not one. Thirteen refugees have been denied evacuation by the medical panel. It is working. Not one refugee here for treatment has had an injunction applied to stop them going back, as the Minister for Home Affairs would have us believe—more lies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But all of these people do desperately need resettlement—and not back to Manus Island or Nauru. The government can and must prioritise resettlement options. This government can and must act immediately to take up offers from New Zealand. They can and must support the medical evacuation of all refugees who need treatment in Australia with their families, and they can and must support refugees and people seeking asylum when they are here in our community amongst us. They can and must ensure dignity, respect and safety for everyone we are responsible for. They are basic human rights. Thank you.</span>

                    <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  Even the title of the Migration Amendment (Repairing Medical Transfers) Bill 2019—'repairing medical transfers'—is a misnomer. It's a disgraceful abuse of the name of the bill. I think Australians understand that our country can be strong on borders but still treat people with humanity and decency. That's why the last parliament passed legislation to help sick refugees and asylum seekers who are currently on Nauru and Manus Island to receive urgent medical care. The bill was needed because prime ministers and ministers for immigration and border protection and for home affairs have let people languish in indefinite detention on Manus Island and Nauru for six years. This government is now in its third term, and still we have no answer to indefinite detention on Manus Island and Nauru from this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support—and I said it repeatedly as the then shadow minister for immigration and border protection—offshore processing, turnbacks when safe to do so, and regional resettlement. This government is running a desperate and shrill scare campaign, as they've done again and again since the days of <span style="font-style:italic;">Tampa</span>. Again and again they've spread baseless lies about Labor's position on border protection and demonised people for political gain. For example, the ridiculous decision to reopen the Christmas Island detention centre was a hysterical and unhinged response by a desperate government. Our parliament was good enough to approach these matters in a grown-up and I think rational and reasonable way. Labor worked with the crossbench to achieve what is commonly called the medevac legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next important step this government must undertake is to resettle refugees and asylum seekers who are still languishing on Nauru and Manus. We need safe third-country settlement options. Since February 2013 we've had on the table from New Zealand an offer to take 150 refugees a year from Manus and Nauru. When the Abbott government came to power, they canned that. The Turnbull government didn't take up the offer. The Morrison government hasn't taken up the offer. Imagine if this government had taken up New Zealand's generous and decent offer—150 a year—or negotiated more. We wouldn't have this problem. We wouldn't have this situation where we've got this pernicious legislation that this government is bringing into the House today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government will do anything. I mentioned Christmas Island. They were going to spend $1.4 billion on Christmas Island—a $60,000 stunt whereby the Prime Minister flew to Christmas Island for a press conference. Even then, they spend $185 million, according to the budget papers, in relation to Christmas Island, reopening a detention centre they closed, just for political gains, and at the same time cut $300 million from the Home Affairs budget, cutting frontline staff and ICT arrangements. So, that's what they'll do. They've just spent $185 million on a stunt, and they'll cut frontline service delivery. For too long, this government has failed to treat vulnerable people on Manus and Nauru with decency and humanity, providing timely and adequate care. We should not be surprised, because the Liberal Party and the National Party are a party who in 2011 shamefully blocked the Malaysia solution, which would have stopped the boats. After failing this parliament by opposing Labor's legislation, 600 people drowned at sea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know Kerryn Phelps, the former member for Wentworth, is not here now, but I pay tribute to her for the work she did with me and with others on this medevac legislation. Before the Wentworth by-election, the Prime Minister said he'd accept New Zealand's offer, and guess what? After the by-election, he ripped it away. Labor recalibrated its position to enter into negotiations with the government about the people who are subject to this bill, but the Prime Minister straightaway ripped it away for political purposes. This government will do anything to avoid dealing with the real issue—that is, the resettlement of these people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill that's before the House was opposed by stakeholders. The medevac legislation currently on the statute books is supported by stakeholders. Why? Because I was in the room with them. I met with them time and time again. I met with Kerryn Phelps, the former member for Wentworth. I met with the crossbenchers to negotiate. They picked up Labor's idea of an Independent Health Advice Panel. We negotiated those issues again and again in meeting after meeting I had for weeks, if not months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stakeholders support Labor and the crossbencher's position here. They don't want this bill to pass the chamber. The AMA, the Law Council, the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, Doctors Without Borders, the Refugee Council—I could go on and on—don't want this bill before the chamber passed. Let's be very clear: the medevac legislation this government is seeking to abolish does not apply to new arrivals. It is ring-fenced. Only those people detained on Manus and Nauru currently are covered. The existing cohort and the people who come to Australia, I might add, are also subject to legislation because this government has brought 900 people here. We know this because the Independent Health Advice Panel report on 29 June said there are 348 people on Nauru and 531 in PNG; 879 people on Manus and Nauru are languishing in indefinite detention. We know from that report, which has been tabled in parliament by the Minister for Home Affairs or at his behest, that there are 900 people currently in Australia for medical or psychiatric assessment or treatment, because they can't get it in PNG or Nauru.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What has the government done? When people need that treatment or assessment—often mental health, psychiatric or physical—and when doctors recommend it, what have the government been doing? They have been fighting every step of the way in court case after court case, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer funds—over $300,000 in last year alone. They have been fighting and—guess what?—caving in at the last minute to create the fiction that they're still tough on border protection. They cave in again and again. Sometimes the litigation is not necessary, and they just realise it's necessary to bring the person to Australia—say, the Royal Brisbane Women's Hospital or the PA Hospital in Brisbane, in my home state of Queensland. They're brought here, and the government are costing us. There is no orderly pathway. The government fight tooth and nail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is trying to get rid of a process that is working now, that we know is working because the stakeholders tell us it's working as well. And the boats keep coming. But more people are coming to this country under this government not on boats but with boarding passes. We know boats keep coming because we see that they do. The government leak strategically to favoured journalists and their favoured news outlets the fact that a boat has arrived. This week we've seen a leak. But, of course, this is the cloak of operational secrecy about what's happening in Operation Sovereign Borders that they impose again, and then they leak it for political gain. It's no secret. We saw on the front page of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> this week that another boat came. We know boats come. We saw a boat arrive—actually in Australia, I might add—the week that the Minister for Home Affairs challenged the then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull for the leadership of the Liberal Party and the prime ministership of this country. As I say, through their incompetence, maladministration and political ineptitude they've allowed this issue to continue year after year after year. This is a minister who presides over Cape class patrol boats languishing in dock because they haven't got petrol and they haven't got crews. This is a minister who cuts frontline staff and hundreds of millions of dollars but allows a stunt to cost taxpayers $185 million.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What about the fact that asylum seekers are more likely to come with boarding passes than on boats? Ninety per cent of those who come by plane are found not to be refugees. They stay in Australia until their cases are resolved. We've seen a record 230,000 bridging visas issued in this country, with 27,931 applications made for protection visas in the last year alone and a record 64,362 in the last four years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're debating a bill now to try and abolish an orderly, working process for people to get urgent medical treatment. Where are the priorities for this government? Where are they? The medevac bill is working as we always intended it to work. We on the Labor side were ensuring that sick people could get the medical care they needed. We were ensuring that the minister has final discretion over medical transfers on national security, public safety or character grounds. And the minister's discretion is retained. I was absolutely adamant that we weren't going to outsource the minister's discretion to third-party stakeholders or to doctors. That's why we negotiated it in the way we did. The minister still has capacity, in the event of adverse security assessments or serious risk of criminal conduct by these people, to prevent the transfer. When people come to this country as a result of the transfer, they're detained and they get the medical treatment they need. That's what happens for those 900 or so people who've been brought here without the process of the medevac legislation. They're still detained and they get the medical treatment that they need. I've met many of them at detention centres around the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government, under this legislation that they're trying to abolish, has approved about 90 transfers, and 20 cases have been referred to the Independent Health Advice Panel. Of those 20, the panel has upheld the minister's decision not to transfer the individual on 13 occasions and overturned the minister's decision not to transfer on seven occasions. So this independent panel, appointed by the Minister for Home Affairs I might add—the minister owes them an apology for the way he demonises them—is made up of the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer, the Department of Home Affairs Chief Medical Officer and six others, including a nominee of the AMA, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and an expert in paediatric health. They're doing their job, and the medevac legislation is working.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The medevac legislation empowers the minister to consider national security grounds. This government claims all the time that it's being tough on crime and expelling people from the country on character grounds—on the basis of serious criminality. The legislation makes reference to a definition of 'security' as 'the protection of Australia's territorial and border integrity from serious threats'. Those opposite claim that's the case when they punt people out of the country, but when it comes to legislation that's been negotiated by Labor and the crossbench it's not relevant. The inconsistency of this government when it come to that is rank. When people come to this country, whether it's through the medevac legislation or as a result of having to instigate proceedings in court or because the government simply gives in because the person's mistreatment has been so egregious that they need psychiatric or medical care, they're immediately required by law to be detained in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister only allows them to not be detained—if I can put it like that—and to be released into the community if he feels it's in the public interest to do so. And he should be allowed to do it if they're no risk to the public. So the minister has that incredible power to protect the Australian public, protect their territorial and border integrity from serious threats and protect them under the migration power and the character test of serious risk of criminality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What do we know about these people? The minister demonises them and makes out that somehow, under this legislation, there was going to be a flood of murderers, rapists and paedophiles in this country. But we know all about these people, and that's what Malcolm Turnbull, the then Prime Minister of this country, said to Donald Trump, the President of the United States. Before these people were put on Manus and Nauru, a memorandum of understanding was signed with the governments of PNG and Nauru and security checks were undertaken in relation to these people. There would be no people in detention we would know more about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government should withdraw this legislation and listen to the stakeholders. It's a disgrace and a despicable move by the Minister for Home Affairs to institute the practices he wants to undertake in relation to the abolition of this legislation. The government should hang their heads in shame for this legislation being before the chamber.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  I too rise to oppose this bill. Looking at the title of this particular bill that we're debating, the Migration Amendment (Repairing Medical Transfers) Bill 2019, I have to say that this legislation was repaired in the last parliament by what was moved in this House. It was changed to make it humane and to give the medical attention that was required to people who were in Nauru and on Manus Island. It was for them to be able to receive that medical attention, which is the humane thing to do. These people are in custody; they're in detention. They're our responsibility. When someone is sick, when someone needs a doctor and when someone is seeking medical attention, it is the humane and right thing to do to give those people the medical attention that they require.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we have, again, a government that is using refugees as a political football. We know this because their track record has been such ever since they came into government and when they were in government previously. When you look at the history and the track record of this government—you don't have to go that far back—you will remember the children overboard and how that event was manipulated for the political benefit of the government. This amendment here today and these topics that we're discussing are exactly the same. This is an issue that this government is seeking to use to manipulate and to play politics with. That is wrong. I've stood up in this place many times, as many of my colleagues have, to say that it's wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have people who need medical attention. They are our responsibility while they are being detained. They need the help of medical treatment. This shows, again, how cruel this government can be. There are no security risks. There are no border challenges. This has nothing to do with watering down our border protection. It has nothing to do with refugee policies and changing the way that we resettle people. This has simply to do with giving medical attention to people that require it. It is inhumane and it is cruel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a government that's meant to look after people. Here they are basically denying people the medical attention that they require. Many of these people on Manus and Nauru are seeking refugee status. The majority will be found to be genuine refugees and will be resettled here in Australia. But we have a government that's playing politics again. We know that the bill was passed in this House not long ago to ensure that people were getting that attention they required. It had nothing to do with watering down our refugee policy. It had nothing to do with our border protection. It was simply a measure to ensure that people get one of the human rights that are required by people all over the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has used this, once again, to play politics with. It has been the trend all along by this government. For many, many years, and in the previous coalition government that existed from 1996 right through to 2007, it has been their trend. This is no different. This is absolutely no different. The government wants to refuse people medical attention, and this includes women and children and people who have been sitting and languishing in these places for many years. Our objective is that the medevac bill is necessary and it's been working. It's been working very well. We argued that, if the government had legitimate proposals to improve the operations, let's see them, let's hear about them. Where are the government members to stand up and defend what it put up today? Where are they to prosecute it and argue why this is needed? I see no government members on the list of speakers—none whatsoever. That's because they can't argue it. There is no argument and there are no points that they can make.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How can Australians believe the government when they routinely manipulate this issue? They misrepresent and mischaracterise the truth for political gain. We have a minister and a government that constantly cry wolf when it comes to this issue—constantly—because they have nothing else to offer the Australian public. All they have is the scare tactics and the divisive politics—dividing our community and dividing the public out there on this particular issue. The reality, as I said earlier—and every other speaker on this side has said this—is that this issue has nothing to do with watering down our border protection or watering down the settlement processes in place for refugees. This is simply a measure to ensure that people who require medical attention, and that includes women and children, are given that attention as quickly as possible. We saw cases on Nauru and Manus where people actually died because they didn't get that attention. It was reported in the papers. We saw people, for months, fighting in the courts. In the end, most of the time it has been found that they had to receive that attention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the medevac laws were enacted, only seven patients have been transferred to Australia without the approval of the immigration minister, David Coleman. The minister didn't reject these cases on security or character concerns but on medical grounds. The individuals were only transferred to Australia after being assessed by an expert panel of doctors that the minister got to choose. This once again highlights the failure of the minister and the government to do their job. It's mismanagement of basic legislative tasks and mismanagement of the department.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government oversaw $300 million of Australian Border Force budget blowouts, resulting in the Australian Border Force fleet being ordered to stop the patrols, as we all heard, when medevac came in, to save money—it's just ridiculous—and $7 million was spent on a strategic review of the Department of Home Affairs. We're not even allowed to see what that strategic review was about, yet $7 million was spent on it. We won't go into the failure of the managed offshore contracts, which we all read about in the papers and saw in the media. This is a bill that has been put in place by the government to divide the community and prevent people from getting the medical attention they require. They are out there basically misrepresenting and telling the Australian public something that isn't true. We've heard this time and time again. When it comes to this particular issue, all we have seen is divisive politics without any purpose and without any processes in place; it's just to play politics. I think it's about time—and I've said this many times—that we stopped playing politics with human beings, with refugees. We've been doing it for far too long, we've been doing it for the wrong reasons in this place, and it's about time that we stopped doing this. I fear that this isn't the end of it and that we will see many, many nasty, inhumane proposals by this government over the next three years. When they have nothing to offer for the betterment of Australia and for the betterment of the future of the next generation, they will just be manipulative with refugees, migration and the issues that we've constantly seen for many years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I fear for the way we're going in this nation. This has to stop, because the way that we've been treating refugees is wrong. We should start looking at being a humane nation, with a government that looks after people and ensures that we keep our border protection. But, at the same time, when people need medical attention they should get medical attention.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  I rise to speak against any repeal of the Migration Amendment (Repairing Medical Transfers) Bill 2019, known as the medevac legislation. As was intended, the legislation that we passed earlier this year has ensured that sick people in detention on Manus Island, in PNG, and Nauru get the medical care they need. This was our objective, given that the offshore facilities set up six years ago as temporary offshore regional processing centres have become places of ongoing limbo, of indefinite detention, for too many people, not providing adequate high-level health services for sick people who are in our care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a problem of the current government's own making. They've been in charge now for six years and have failed to help these vulnerable people. Before there's a howl of outrage from those opposite—who seem to have missed the compassion gene in their DNA for this particular group of people and, sadly, for many others—let's get some facts straight. The government has approved approximately 90 transfers to Australia on medical grounds, and 20 cases have been referred to the Independent Health Advice Panel, or IHAP. Of the 20 cases referred to the IHAP, the panel has upheld the minister's decision not to transfer the individual on 13 occasions and overturned the minister's decision not to transfer on seven occasions. So, that is seven times that someone has been refused by the minister but overturned by the independent panel. This is a decision made by an independent panel of doctors that the minister himself chose. This panel includes some of Australia's best doctors, including the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer and the Surgeon-General of the Australian Border Force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's one other important point to make about these seven cases. The existing legislation that we worked hard to bring about ensured that the minister had final discretion over medical transfers on national security, public safety or character grounds. So, these seven people whom the minister objected to were not objected to for any of those reasons. That tells me that medevac is necessary, and it's working. It tells me that the minister's claim that 'two doctors from Nimbin' can force the government to bring people from Manus Island or Nauru to Australia is simply not the case. It tells me that the minister's claims that '1,000 people would flood Australia' through medevac is also not the case. If there are legitimate proposals to improve the operation of medevac, then Minister Dutton should put those amendments forward rather than simply trying to repeal the entire legislation. The government has not built a case for repealing this legislation. What is the case is that this bill has allowed people who desperately need care to get the medical treatment they require. It's a human right, and one this government has failed to deliver for so long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Saturday the Hawkesbury branch of Rural Australians for Refugees held a vigil for the people on Manus Island and Nauru for whom medical care came too late. I thank them for doing that, and I thank those who attended for recognising the lives of people who've died and for mourning their deaths. These are people who, in their attempts to flee from war or torture or death, found themselves in detention. They're people like Hamid Khazaei, a man in his early 20s who died from a skin infection that turned into septicaemia in August 2014. The Queensland coroner investigating the death found that doctors on the island had urged his immediate transfer to Australia, but this was first ignored, including by the Department of Immigration bureaucrats who didn't read their emails for up to 13 hours, and then it was rejected by the department. After further pleading from the doctors trying to treat him, approval was finally granted—two days after the initial request—to move Hamid, by now semiconscious and septic. But the department ordered that he be moved not to Australia but to Port Moresby's Pacific International Hospital. There he was, unfortunately, misdiagnosed, treated with broken equipment and left unattended as he grew more and more critically ill. He suffered a series of cardiac arrests. By the time he was transported to Brisbane's Mater Hospital he was profoundly brain damaged. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Queensland Coroner Terry Ryan, in handing down his findings, said that Hamid's death was preventable and recommended that health care on the offshore islands be properly funded and run and be under the control of doctors or that asylum seekers and refugees be moved to Australia. That was in 2014. There was no action by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Independent Health Advice Panel tells us that the majority of medical consultations even now on Nauru are for mental health problems. In its first assessment of health facilities on Nauru the Independent Health Advice Panel found that there is no access to high-quality inpatient psychiatric care and that patients with severe mental illness are at a higher risk of suicide and should be transferred to a hospital with appropriate inpatient psychiatric care. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of those who killed themselves last year was 26-year-old Fariborz Karami. Fariborz was a Kurdish Iranian asylum seeker. He was the 12th person to die within an Australian offshore immigration detention centre since 2012. At the time—and now—there were serious concerns about his 12-year-old brother too. Both his brother and his mother had pleaded for medical help for him, as he declined in the months leading up to his death. We don't live in a country where life is cheap. These young men—people the age of my son—deserve a chance for a future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to mention the conditions that medevac patients find themselves in, as reported recently in the media. From what I have seen and read recently in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> it is clear that we are still missing some humanity in how we're treating some people. Many of them are still effectively in a prison. There are reports of hotel rooms in Brisbane being used while others are in detention centres between Brisbane and Adelaide, but the conditions are not necessarily conducive to someone being adequately treated for a serious psychiatric condition. I urge the government to deliver, no matter where the treatment occurs, high-quality health care, as we are required to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also refer to comments by the Minister for Health in question time yesterday. He talked about mental health. He talked about the priority it was not just for this government but for this parliament. I ask that the minister apply those same principles to people who are in our care. We are responsible for people, and their mental health is something that we can make a difference to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think above all else, after six years of inaction, this government has to take up the renewed offer from the New Zealand Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, to resettle 150 people currently in offshore detention. It's a deal that has been open to the government for years, and not a move has been made to take it. It would allow more people to be resettled and to rebuild their lives, as the US agreement does—and that must also be completed as planned. The governor of Manus Island, Charlie Benjamin, is also urging Australia to help resettle refugees to a third country. This is something everyone wants to see. I welcome comments by some members opposite, like the member for Monash, who recognises that Australia can't continue indefinite detention and who is urging his own government to finish resettling detainees. It is good to hear that sentiment coming from the other side of the House. </span>

They are not in conflict with each other. I wish that this government would remember that.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:14</span>):  The parliament has already dealt with this issue. The medevac laws are working. They provide a medical solution to a medical problem, and those medical problems are faced by asylum seekers and people found to be genuine refugees and who are under Australia's duty of care. They put medical professionals rather than politicians at the centre of decision-making but with an appropriate veto power of the minister. The minister has used this power, I believe, on just a few occasions. There have been approximately 90 transfers, overwhelmingly for serious mental health issues. We know people have lost their lives on Manus and Nauru. We know that people have taken their lives on Manus and Nauru, and I remind this House that these people are under the care and responsibility of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's rhetoric that the passing of the medevac bill would bring hordes of boats to our shores was proven to be false, and I don't think anyone in this chamber would argue with that. It was completely false, because the bill is ring fenced around just those asylum seekers and people found to be genuine refugees who are currently on Manus and Nauru. There is no pull factor for people from other destinations. The government knew this but continued to—I would say unashamedly—play to the fears of some in our community. They even went through the incredibly extensive media stunt of briefly opening Christmas Island for the cameras, only to quietly close it again. It was an offensive display and, I believe, one of the lowest points in politics this year. It was shameful. So I say again that the medevac laws are working and Centre Alliance will not buy into attempts at playing politics with people's lives. We will remain steadfast in backing a medical solution to a medical problem, with the appropriate safeguards there for the minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I respect that many people in this place feel comfortable talking about their faith. I would say to every person in this House who wants to repeal this legislation and who calls themselves a Christian, as indeed I do, to go and re-read Matthew 25:31-46. There is no need for me to quote the entire piece of scripture in this chamber, but Matthew 25 makes it very clear that Christians should see everyone as Christ in the flesh. In the New Testament, stranger and neighbour are in fact synonymous. The golden rule of 'love your neighbour as yourself' refers not just to the people you know—your neighbours—but also to those you do not know. And I'm sure I do not need to remind every person who follows Christ that Christ too was a refugee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government is successful in repealing this legislation, it will cause much harm—needless harm, unnecessary harm. It is quite simply a wicked thing that we are doing in this place. It is unnecessary. And I will therefore, in the strongest possible terms, oppose this bill, as will my Centre Alliance colleagues in another place.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="248181" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:18</span>):  I rise today to oppose in the strongest terms possible the government's Migration Amendment (Repairing Medical Transfers) Bill 2019. This is indeed the Morrison government's shameful attempt to repeal humanitarian legislation that allows for people in PNG and Nauru to receive the appropriate medical care on the advice of doctors. The very fact that we need to legislate to force this government to fulfil its basic duty of care to vulnerable asylum seekers is deeply saddening. The idea that the government would choose to frame this legislation, which has the sole purpose of giving sick people the care they need, as some sort of dangerous and radical heresy is astounding. The decision of those opposite to oppose the medevac legislation tells you everything you need to know about the character of this government. Those opposite looked inside and found that, even if they marshalled their combined compassion and ethical integrity, they still couldn't stretch to allowing desperately sick people to get the medical attention they need and deserve. Instead they chose the path of stoking fear and division over fulfilling their moral responsibility. They chose rank electioneering over meeting Australia's duty of care to vulnerable asylum seekers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has put forward any number of arguments now against the legislation that was passed by this parliament last term, but none of them have been proven to have any merit whatsoever. We haven't seen the boats restart; we haven't seen rapists, murderers and other criminals arriving on our shores; and we haven't seen our hospitals buckling under the crippling weight of caring for thousands of new patients. What we have seen, however, is that vulnerable asylum seekers now have an avenue and an orderly process by which they can access the care they so desperately need. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This whole sorry episode has been a continuation of this government's cruel and opportunistic agenda when it comes to the treatment of some of the most vulnerable people on the planet. The fact that the government is now doubling-down and again attempting to use lies and misinformation for political gain at the expense of asylum seekers just reinforces how morally bereft they really are. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Home Affairs has argued that there's no need for the medevac legislation. This is blatantly untrue. For too long the Abbott, Turnbull and now Morrison governments have failed to look after vulnerable people in regional processing centres. For too long these people haven't been getting the care they need or they've being kept waiting for months or years for it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Manus Island and Nauru were originally set up as regional transit processing centres. The fact that they have become places of horrific, indefinite detention under this government is to our great national shame. Some of the most vulnerable people on the planet have been forced to live in limbo for years with no pathway to resolution. Labor has long urged the government to take up New Zealand's offers of resettling refugees there. But the government has refused, instead choosing to keep these poor people languishing in detention indefinitely. The sense of hopelessness that they must feel is unimaginable, and the government's failure to leave no stone unturned in finding a solution for six years is unforgivable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this point, I want to pay tribute to the staunch advocacy of the many grandmothers against detention in my electorate. This extraordinarily committed group of mostly women have been holding a weekly vigil in Newcastle for the innocent people who have been caught up in this seemingly endless cycle of trauma for more than two years now. This week they held an anniversary vigil to mourn the last six years of this indefinite detention. To those who participated, I thank you for your humanity, your compassion and your advocacy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned earlier, there is a dire and undeniable need for the medevac legislation. In 2016, the UNHCR found that 88 per cent of the people on Manus Island were suffering from depression, anxiety and/or post-traumatic stress disorder. Then, last year, Medecins Sans Frontieres put out its extremely depressing and distressing report entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Indefinite Despair</span>. This report found that nearly one in three of the asylum seekers they treated in Nauru had suicidal thoughts and nearly one in three attempted suicide. This included children as young as nine. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The facilities at the regional processing facilities are grossly inadequate to handle this crisis. This is nothing short of government sanctioned neglect, and it cannot go on. That's exactly what medevac is about, and it's supported by the Australian Medical Association, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, the Law Council and the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre to name just a notable few. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before this legislation passed earlier this year, it took legal action for this government to be convinced to fulfil its duty of care. Indeed, I understand that every litigated case resulted in a medical transfer to Australia, and that has been more than 50 cases now. With today's legislation, the government isn't proposing amendments or improvements to the medevac process; no, it wants to axe it entirely. And that means a return to the flawed and compromised medical transfer system that has failed asylum seekers again and again and again. The determination of this government to see vulnerable asylum seekers again plunged into a situation where there is no easy process to seek appropriate medical care is unconscionable. Why hasn't a single government member put their name down to stand up and explain to the chamber today why sick people shouldn't get the care they need—the care that Australia has a responsibility to provide?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned earlier, there has been a lot of misinformation about this bill, and, shamefully, a lot of it has been coming from the government. What does the original bill actually do? Basically, it provides an avenue by which two independent Australian doctors can recommend that an asylum seeker needing urgent medical attention can be transferred temporarily to Australia. Before the doctors make their determination, they must be sure that the asylum seeker cannot get the treatment they need on Nauru or Manus. The bill also provides other safeguards, built into the legislation, for the protection of Australia and Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are three reasons the Minister for Home Affairs can refuse a transfer. He can refuse if he doesn't believe it's necessary. He can refuse if he believes the transfer would pose harm to Australia's security. He can also reject a transfer if he believes, on character grounds on the basis of the person's criminal record, that it would expose the Australian community to a serious risk of criminal conduct. If the minister thinks that it's not necessary for the individual's health then the case goes to the Independent Health Advice Panel for review. There are plenty of opportunities for the minister responsible to reject these transfers if any one of those three criteria are met.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Any reasonable, compassionate person can see there's nothing controversial about the medevac legislation. Indeed, Labor went to great lengths to introduce responsible safeguards at the time. First, we ensured the minister could deny a transfer on national security grounds or in the case of serious criminality. Second, we extended the time frames to refuse the transfer to make the process more workable and flexible. Third, we ring fenced the legislation so it could only apply to a set number of people in regional processing, thereby removing any incentive for people to risk their lives at sea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There can be absolutely no justification for the government to overturn this legislation on national security or any other grounds. And yet, as I mentioned, the government has fabricated any number of spurious claims for its own rank political reasons. I don't wish to articulate all of those today, because we simply won't have time. But we do not have a system in crisis here. There is no risk to our borders and there is no invitation for thousands of undocumented boat arrivals, as the government might have us believe. No. What we have is a humane and compassionate process that allows Australia to fulfil its duty of care, and the Prime Minister knows it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one has seriously bought the government's misrepresentations of this benign humanitarian process, much though the government might like for that to be the case. It is shocking that this government's crude and callous politicisation and shameless pointscoring continues in this area of policy. It is indeed rank political pointscoring and popularism that is the only threat posed to our national security in this whole sorry episode. I think the member for Mayo articulated well the shameful trajectory that we have taken to get to this point where the Morrison Liberal government now seeks to overturn a perfectly workable, humane and compassionate piece of legislation to bring some redress to what is a horrific and shameful chapter in our national history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That members opposite on the government benches continue to pursue this attack in this chamber is to their great shame. They bring great discredit on this parliament and on the thoroughly democratic processes that we all took part in in the last term of parliament to ensure that there was some relief for those people who have been left stranded in indefinite detention, for more than six years now, on Manus and Nauru. It is unconscionable. It cannot continue. The government must step aside.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  The Warragul Red Cross celebrated its AGM and 90th birthday last week. Outgoing chair, Shirley Grove, new chair, Isabell Ough, new treasurer, Rose Atkins, and ongoing secretary, Helen Langres, certainly made it a great celebration. Shirley Grove, as the outgoing chair, told the story of her first Red Cross meeting. Can you believe it? She was invited over the back fence by Molly Utber in Koo Wee Rup. She first met my mother, Bronwyn Broadbent, at that meeting more than 40 years ago. Molly Utber was such a wonderful person in the Koo Wee Rup district, including in Lang Lang. I said, 'What's the connection with the Geelong Football Club and Molly Utber?' No-one in the room knew, but I knew. Molly Utber was Patrick Dangerfield's great-great-grandmother. So Red Cross has been not only serving the community but producing high-class athletes for a very long time. At every major tragedy in all our electorates you'll see Red Cross turning up. They've been doing it for more than 100 years, and Warragul Red Cross has celebrated 90 years of service.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  Today I rise to speak about one of the wonderful schools in my electorate, Thornbury Primary School. Thornbury is leading the way in nurturing the next generation of young leaders, particularly in the face of a climate emergency. The students at Thornbury Primary School have collated a petition which draws attention to the dire need for Australia to act on climate change. It was signed by 295 of the students, who are aged between five and 12 years, with one overarching ask: a future and a climate that is safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The climate emergency will vastly impact on the lives of the next generation and generations to come. Unfortunately, on this issue the government is reckless. As the kids know, the latest IPCC report places our Earth on a disastrous trajectory towards irreversible temperature rise, drought and natural disasters, placing the economy and Australian jobs at risk. Yet, if this government had a real plan, Australia could be leading the way to mitigating this climate emergency. With certainty instead of chaos, we could be encouraging clean energy production, sustainable industries and investment in jobs and the growing renewable economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the students from the Thornbury Primary School who are asking the government to act now on climate change, I promise I will continue to stand up for your future and continue to fight for real action on climate change.</span>

Of course, I speak of the great Brighton Icebergers. Among them is Don Warner, who recently authored <span style="font-style:italic;">Beyond the Tip: Tales of the Icebergers of Brighton</span>, which explores their shared love of pushing themselves through the bay come rain, hail or shine. The group is over 100 strong and includes nurses, engineers, medicos, architects and politicians—former rather than present. But backgrounds matter not when you're in the bay in your togs at the crack of dawn. Everybody is welcome to share this pathway to fitness and wellbeing. As local legend and Icebergers founder, John Locco, puts it, you never regret a swim. Having done it myself, I know that feeling of being in the cool waters of Port Phillip in the morning.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don Warner's book contains 230 pages chronicling the swimming histories of 152 Icebergers. For the Icebergers history buffs amongst us, you can find <span style="font-style:italic;">Beyond the Tip</span> at Thesaurus Books on Church Street in Brighton or at the baths.</span>

This is the ADF's biggest overseas engagement activity, maintaining and developing relationships with our neighbours. Up to 1,500 ADF personnel took part. The joint task force visited Sri Lanka, India, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore and Indonesia. The young men and women of the ADF continue to demonstrate Australians' ability to deliver peacekeeping and security operations as well as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief in our region. At Darwin Airport, I bumped into their boss, Air Commodore Rick Owen, the commander of the joint task force, who had nothing but praise for all those under his command—our soldiers, sailors, air men and women, and even a couple of Defence and DFAT civilians thrown in. He told me his troops were engaging, friendly and professional. He told me they represented all that is good about Australia and he was proud of them, and we are proud of them. We recognise their sacrifices and the wives, husbands and children who also sacrifice a great deal during these lengthy deployments.</span>

My mum spent about 50 years being a position holder within the CWA in Shepparton and Congupna but also throughout the Goulburn Valley and Victoria. So I have a fantastic place in my heart for the selfless work they do for their communities, always putting their communities ahead of themselves.</span>

In the Lower Blue Mountains most people will eventually get FTTC, but the Hawkesbury is a technological mess, with satellite, wireless, FTTN, FTTC and FTTP for those lucky early receivers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The boundary problems we're seeing between what NBN will service with fixed line and wireless are exasperating. Some houses will miss out on a fixed line because of the rigidity of the boundaries that NBN Co is using. At one home you have FTTC while the neighbour has to make do with wireless. You can only wonder that someone hasn't even bothered to look on Google Earth, let alone gone anywhere near the place in person.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because NBN is under pressure to put cost and speed ahead of quality in the rollout, we're seeing aerial fibre cabling being strung up along Telstra wires when, in a bushfire-prone area like ours, underground would have made much more sense. I don't have confidence that NBN Co will do a better job of vegetation management than Telstra has with its aerial copper lines, or than our power companies have done, for that matter.</span>

After more than two decades and many false starts, work on the proposed state-of-the-art facility finally kicked off yesterday. All of this was made possible after the Commonwealth government invested $3.4 million through the regional jobs and investment package to take the project from the drawing board to a reality, along with a commitment for some 42 beds. More than 40 much-needed jobs will be created during construction, and there will be many ongoing jobs as well. A development lease between the Salvation Army and the Douglas Shire Council was first agreed to in 2016. Progress stalled in March this year, when the initial construction company pulled out, which paved the way for Total Construction to take over the project. Once completed, the 42-bed centre will give priority to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as well as those who are financially and socially disadvantaged or people from rural and remote areas. The centre will also cater for people living with dementia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to pay special tribute to everyone who has played a role in the centre becoming a reality, including Dr Bob Lansky, former councillor Bob Gray, Marjorie Norris, Shirley Vico and Joan Gray. It has been a long journey, but this is a fantastic win for Mossman and the broader community. I'm certainly proud to have played a role in this very, very significant event.</span>

I rise today to congratulate that team on winning that bid and securing an A-League licence for the west of Melbourne. I attended last week the Western United fan forum in a local space. I want to congratulate ‎Maurice Bisetto, Steve Horvat, Lou Sticca and the whole team that put this bid together. With him, I congratulate Wyndham City Council and, in particular, Kate Roffey for her work in preparing the bid and beating out two other Victorian bids, one from Dandenong and one from South Melbourne.</span>

That stadium will be built next to the Regional Rail Link, a proud federal Labor initiative. On 6 December 2018, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span> reported, in the middle of this bid process, that the Morrison government had indicated a willingness to fund the building of the Team 11 stadium if it won the bid. Today I stand here and call on the Morrison government: you were keen to support the Dandenong stadium; we need a railway station to support the Western United Football Club.</span>

Larry is the owner and founder of Larry Adler Ski and Outdoor. Moving to Australia from South Africa, Larry opened a pharmacy while teaching people how to ski. In 1976, he decided to begin stocking hats, skis, boots and poles in his pharmacy to keep up with demand in what was a relatively untapped market. Since then, the business has grown to include six stores spread across the northern beaches, the Sydney CBD, Jindabyne and even the island of Hokkaido in Japan. This is in addition to a large online presence.</span>

Larry has built his business on a number of core values, including trust, credibility and professionalism. He has long been recognised as Australia's leading authority on ski equipment and boot fitting. This has been reflected in his past appointment as the Australian national ski team's official boot fitter and as the ski and snowboard retailer of the year. I'm proud to acknowledge the impact that Larry's business has had on the northern beaches as well as the skiing and outdoor communities in Australia and abroad.</span>

The parliament must understand that there is a parasitic consultancy service out there. While $540 million was allocated for water development in northern Australia, not one single dam or weir has been built and the consultants are getting fat, lazy and stupid. The proposal that they have put up for Hells Gate dam would completely destroy the vision of the greatest engineer and maybe the greatest Australian the country has ever produced, Dr JJC Bradfield. It would completely destroy it. They are a bunch of little pygmies from overseas—from my experience, most of them are migrants that have come to Australia—and I wonder whether they have any love for this country at all. Their proposal has reduced the Hells Gate dam proposal to a tiny 80 farms for Townsville. There are 960 farms in Ayr and 670 farms in Ingham, but we're going to spend $5.3 billion to create 70 farms. The Bradfield scheme, stage 1, Hells Gate produces seven per cent of Australia's petrol as ethanol—clean, cheap and for forever. It produces 1½ per cent of Australia's electricity—clean, cheap and forever. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  I have so many amazing community groups and sports clubs in my electorate of Boothby, and the Glenelg Baseball Club is no exception. This year I've had the pleasure of visiting the club on a number of occasions, together with my South Australian colleague Matt Cowdrey MP, the member for Colton, to see their facilities and to spend time with President Matt Jones, life member Bob Bradley and the many players and supporters and incredible volunteers of this fantastic local club. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also delighted to attend the Glenelg Baseball Club senior presentation dinner in April to celebrate the end of a very successful 2018-19 season. The club had 10 teams playing finals this season, with seven advancing to the grand final. I congratulate the under-13 juniors, the division 3 and division 4 senior men's sides and the division 2 women's side on their premiership-winning performances. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we have seen with sports clubs throughout my community, participation in grassroots sports is growing, particularly female participation. And the Glenelg Baseball Club is, once again, no exception. That's why I was proud to secure a $100,000 federal funding grant to help upgrade the change room facilities at the club. These facilities will ensure the club can continue to support the growth in player numbers across their male, female, junior and senior sides. I would like to sincerely thank Matt and Bob for working with me to secure this funding, and I look forward to visiting the club again soon.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  I rise today to congratulate and recognise the efforts of Grace Campbell, who will join Richmond's inaugural AFLW squad next year. Grace is a Bendigo girl and, after an outstanding career, including Victorian country selection, Grace played for the Bendigo Thunder seniors team. She quickly established herself as one of the team's premier midfield players. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Grace is from a strong football family—I should say women's football family. Her family, like many, fought for years to recognise women's ability to play. I can remember the many days we spent at the Kangaroo Flat football club cheering on the Thunder players who were still without their own home. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Grace's football career was flourishing until 2017 when she suffered a serious knee injury playing for the Thunder at the QEO. I was there that day. I can remember the horror in the crowd as she fell. It wasn't just her knee, the injury or a football career that took a turn that day; it was also her career as a nurse. As many know, because of the pay gap for women's football, our players, women players, still have to have full-time careers. She has recovered and is going on to be one of the top players from our community in Bendigo. We wish Grace the very best, as well as Richmond the very best, in their inaugural season next year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These two infrastructure projects provide important east-west connectivity between the cities of Joondalup and Wanneroo and beyond. When combined with the NorthLink projects, together with upgrades to the Reid and Tonkin highways, the electorate of Moore is better connected with key commercial and industrial centres such as Wangara, Malaga and beyond; the Perth Airport; major freight and logistic routes; and the Perth to Darwin highway. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new interchanges, with traffic bridges over Wanneroo Road, which received an investment of more than $100 million in federal infrastructure funding, will eliminate traffic lights at the busy intersections, creating freer-flowing traffic and fewer delays. This will improve connectivity for commuter traffic, freight and logistics, promoting economic development within the City of Joondalup and greater region. Residents of Moore will benefit from reduced travel times to key employment and commercial hubs, bringing both amenity and economic growth to our region.</span>

Since she was commissioned in 1993, HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Newcastle</span> has been deployed to the Middle East six times, as well as to East Timor and the Persian Gulf. She also conducted peacekeeping operations in the Solomon Islands and humanitarian missions, including rescuing yachtsmen injured in the 1998 Sydney to Hobart race. The people of Newcastle have great affection for HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Newcastle</span>, which has been crewed by many Novocastrians during its lifetime. Indeed, Commander Sellick, a proud Novocastrian woman, was given the keys to the city when she captained the ship back to Newcastle for its final time in June this year. I was also thrilled to meet up with my ADF exchange buddy, Natalie Brennan, sub lieutenant in the Royal Australian Navy, on that same trip.</span>

It's sad enough that we have lost the ship HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Newcastle</span>, but let's not now lose the name itself.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  Rolling pins were tossed and bricks were thrown through the air at this year's 59th Stroud Brickthrowing Competition. It's an annual competition that started in 1960 when the brickmaking cities of Stroud in England and Stroud in the United States formed the competition. With the participation of Stroud in my electorate, the event is still going strong. International representatives from those countries were present, and Karen Hutchinson from the Stroud Brickthrowing Association said the competition was growing every year and the organisers were thrilled that, in its 59th year, an estimated 3,000 locals and visitors from nearby Newcastle and surrounding communities attended. Whilst I had no success myself in throwing the brick—I had three goes; it's my second appearance—it is now on my CV that I am an international brick throwing competitor. I wish them well in the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was really pleased also to see that the work on repairing the tennis courts following the devastating floods in April 2015 is proceeding apace, courtesy of a federal government grant, with new tennis courts and new change rooms and facilities, and a new multi-purpose centre is also going to be built to replace the two buildings that were literally washed away along with most of the other showground facilities in that devastating flood in 2015. Congratulations!</span>

The earthworks have commenced and are proceeding apace. It will be a wonderful thing for Western Sydney, and in particular south-western Sydney, if we get it right. Unfortunately, this government has not committed to a rail link to Western Sydney Airport from south-western Sydney. This government and the Liberal state government are prepared to fund rail links only in Liberal-held and conservative-held seats, not from those in south-western Sydney.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Infrastructure Australia has described a rail link from south-western Sydney to the airport and into Sydney as vital if the airport is to be successful. It is disgraceful that this federal government and the New South Wales Liberal government will not fund the rail link from south-western Sydney—through Leppington and through the newly developed suburbs around Leppington to Western Sydney Airport—when all the experts agree that this is vital for the functioning of the airport. South-western Sydney is sick of being treated as a dumping ground by this federal Liberal government and by the state Liberal government. It is disgraceful the way they fund infrastructure. They are really denying south-western Sydney a link to the Western Sydney Airport, and it's a disgrace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  I rise to congratulate the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson. Boris is a good friend to Australia who I believe will bring our two nations even closer together. He lived here briefly as a young man, in the seat of Indi, in fact, where he taught the great triad of Latin, English and physical education at the Timbertop campus of Geelong Grammar. Recently, as foreign secretary he did much to build a strong relationship between our two nations. His tenure included announcements to increase the UK's involvement in the Indo-Pacific region, with new diplomatic posts in Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu; and plans for the Royal Navy to have a greater presence in the South China Sea. I for one welcome this commitment to our region from Australia's oldest friend and ally. Boris comes to the prime ministership during one of the most fraught chapters in modern British history. He faces the great challenge of delivering Brexit and uniting his country. </span>

I know they follow their mother country very closely, having made the personal Brexit themselves to down under. On behalf of Canning, I say: congratulations, Boris; we are gunning for you as you navigate the ship of state through the difficult shoals ahead.</span>

In fact, all you will find is a menu of political parlour games. You wouldn't know, for example, that today is the 170th day since the government received the report of the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry. It was not a pretty read. There was, for example, $100 million in unlawful deductions by the National Australia Bank from the superannuation accounts of its wealth management arm; the Commonwealth Bank charging fees for financial advice that was never delivered; ANZ having to deliver compensation to over two million customers who had been charged or ripped off in some way by that bank; and the AMP caught charging more than a million dollars to 4,000 dead people—4,000 dead people!

But do you know what? There was a hitch. There was bit of a problem. The $10 million offered by the Premier actually wasn't real money. It was—wait for it—an 'in-kind contribution' by her state bureaucrats for doing—what?—further assessments so that she can make a decision next year sometime as to whether or not we go for the games. We had Melbourne hosting the games over 60 years ago; Sydney, what, 20 years ago; and today the Queensland Premier lacks confidence in the capacity of her own state to host the games in 2032. Time kills deals. We are in a beautiful spot right now to take first-group advantage. On this day, one year from now, the Tokyo Olympics begin. We need to put forward a compelling proposition, but we can only do that with 'Team Queensland' at the table, and that is why we are calling on the Queensland Premier to get on the blocks and join the team.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:59</span>):  That is a hard act to follow! On this side of the House, we back public schools every day of the week. During the election campaign in Macnamara, there were others who liked to talk down public schools, but not on this side—not in the Labor Party. We back our public schools. And there's no better public school in Macnamara than Middle Park Primary School, first built in 1887. We were proud to commit $1 million to the redevelopment of Middle Park Primary School. It's a school that deserves support from the Labor government, which was going to keep class sizes small—support for students and teachers to make sure that each and every student has the facilities and resources that they need to get a great education, because every single Australian kid deserves a great education no matter what school they go to.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were never going to short-change students like those opposite were. Those opposite were only interested in cutting funding to schools, while we were willing to back our public schools each and every day. Under the Labor government in Victoria our public schools have grown. In Macnamara we have some outstanding public schools, and we support them every single day. Albert Park College has grown under a Labor government. Elwood College has grown under a Labor government. The school closest to my home, Glen Eira College, has grown under a Labor government. We support our kids and we support public education.</span>

An enforceable undertaking then was secured through the action to protect the workers. On this side of the House, we know whose side we're on; it's the Australian workers' side. The Labor Party—who knows whose side they're on. They weren't on the side of tax cuts for Australians, they weren't on the side of farmers dealing with drought and today, we understand, they are only on the side of militant unions.</span>

In that speech yesterday she said this, that she was elected on the mandate that if you have a go, you get a go. No-one exemplifies that better than the member for Chisholm. The member for Chisholm knows that she was elected on the basis of ensuring that Australian workers get a go. I'll tell you how they're getting a go: more jobs; the highest level of employment participation of the working-age population in this nation's history. </span>

                  </a>  On top of that, there is tax relief for all Australians who are working hard, tax relief that the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party have sought to oppose, in this place. At the election they opposed it, seeking only to put more taxes and higher taxes on Australian workers, saying to them that they shouldn't keep more of what they earn. I have already, in my previous answer, referred to the actions we're taking to ensure stronger penalties for those who engage in wage theft. They've increased 10-fold under the legislation our government has put in place—the increased resources we've put into the Fair Work Ombudsman, the criminalisation of worker exploitation, for which laws will come forward from the Attorney-General, shortly, and the Minister for Industrial Relations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It does beg the question. Australians know whose side we're on, when it comes to Australian workers, and their entitlements and their jobs and their earnings. They know where we stand. But where does the Labor Party stand? Firstly, we've got the Labor Party in this place opposing laws which will ensure unions cannot siphon off the earnings of workers' entitlement funds and just spread them willy-nilly to their other union mates. That's like having a union super fund paying the earnings of your superannuation to another union. That's against the law, and this should be against the law also. We also know that they oppose laws that will boot out serially offending union officials from breaking the law just like company directors were. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition says he wants to get rid of John Setka from the union movement. We're only trying to help you here. There's a law here, you can vote for, to ensure that John Setka gets booted from the union movement, and the Leader of the Opposition turns his back on those laws and he turns his back on hardworking Australians.</span>

I can certainly get that for the member. I am aware of several occasions where the ombudsman has taken complaints about underpayment that originally went to a union, without action, and then went to the ombudsman for action. I am aware that in the last budget this government provided $10. 8 million to the Fair Work Ombudsman to investigate precisely the types of things that we're now talking about. I am aware that our government has a zero tolerance for this sort of behaviour, whether that is underpayment or wage theft. The difficulty is that they seem, over there, to have a very low tolerance for underpayment but they've got a monstrously high tolerance when it's workers' money being diverted from workers to unions. That's when their tolerance levels seem to get out of whack. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have $10.8 million given by this government to the Fair Work Ombudsman to investigate these matters. They are now investigated more heavily than they have ever been investigated previously. That builds on $30 million in unpaid wages, representing more than 13,000 workers, with completed audits of 4½ thousand Australian workplaces. That is more than when Labor were last in office. When Labor were last in office—and this might interest the member for Wills—notwithstanding their indignation today, they cut the funding of the Fair Work Ombudsman by 17 per cent. When they were in government, they cut the funding of the body that investigates underpayment, by 17 per cent. Do you know what they also cut, Member for Wills? The Fair Work Ombudsman's staff, who are paid money to investigate underpayment of wages, were cut by 20 per cent by members opposite. The indignation exists now, but, when the rubber was on the road and they were required to investigate these matters, they underfunded and cut the staff of the organisation that was meant to investigate these matters. We'd be very happy for another question like that, Member for Wills—another dixer.</span>

I can inform the House that she brings to this place experience in running her own small business and working in the not-for-profit sector. But, more importantly than that, she is committed to the values that underpin the coalition's policies: respect for the individual and the power of their enterprise; reward for effort; and encouraging aspiration—a term that mystified the member for Sydney. And the member for Lindsay understands that, as a result of the tax cuts that passed this parliament just a couple of weeks ago, 76,909 taxpayers in her electorate will get a tax cut, and more than 34,000 of those will get the full $1,080. Over 13,000 small businesses will also be able to access the extended instant asset write-off, which has been extended to $30,000 and for companies with a turnover of up to $50 million.</span>

It's our tax cuts, where we've changed the rate. For those who earn between $45,000 and $200,000, the rate is being reduced from 32½c to 30c. We've changed the thresholds. For the 19c rate, we've changed the threshold from where it is today, at $37,000, to $45,000. And we're abolishing a whole tax bracket, the 37c-in-the-dollar tax bracket.</span>

Whilst it's unorthodox, certainly the Manager of Opposition Business well knows I've seen many examples where that has occurred. But practice also makes very clear, and I can point out to ministers, that they are entitled, if a question relates to another portfolio, to refer that to a relevant minister if they wish to. That's a right they have. I will leave it in the hands of the Leader of the House whether he wishes to answer it or refer it to a relevant minister.</span>

After that consultation it will make its way to the parliament and we'd expect those opposite to support our legislation. But the point remains that, after the royal commission was handed to us, we took four days to respond; those opposite took 22 days. We have already legislated a significant number of recommendations from the Hayne royal commission. Others are in the pipeline. We're taking great care to do this properly, to get this right, so Australian consumers get a better deal.</span>

Warringah has some of the most congested roads in Australia and it is a huge detriment to people's daily lives. A proposed solution, the Beaches Link tunnel, would improve congestion by bypassing the Spit Bridge, which creates a bottleneck between the Northern Beaches and the Lower North Shore. The proposed Beaches Link tunnel has been talked about for over two decades, including by the former member for Warringah, and is now in the New South Wales planning and assessment process. During the campaign, the federal government committed $50 million from the Urban Congestion Fund to improve access to the tunnel from Balgowlah. Can the minister please tell the House what has happened to that $50 million commitment?</span>

I know how vitally important infrastructure is to him and to the people living in his electorate, particularly the Coffs Harbour bypass. The Liberals and Nationals are getting on with the job of building that $1 billion-plus piece of infrastructure—with tunnels. You won't find a stronger advocate for this than the member for Cowper. He fought hard for it; he is going to deliver it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what is so frustrating and annoying is unlawful union militancy, which is driving up the cost of infrastructure right across the country, right across this nation. The member for Cowper knows all too well the cost of unlawful behaviour to society. He has seen it firsthand as a frontline police officer, as a detective and as a police prosecutor on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales. The Master Builders Association has estimated that infrastructure projects in Australia, including schools, hospitals and roads, cost up to 30 per cent more due to union militancy and unlawful industrial action. It's not just the Master Builders Association that has highlighted this issue. The Business Council of Australia in 2012, and Infrastructure Australia the following year, suggested that infrastructure is 40 per cent more expensive in Australia than in the United States of America. The McKell Institute in 2016 suggested that a two-lane undivided road costs 78 per cent more in Australia than in the European Union, 53 per cent more than in Canada, 42 per cent more than in the US, and 26 per cent more than in the United Kingdom.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What do the unions think about this? Sadly, unfortunately—unbelievably—they're quite proud of it. They think that they are above the law. The CFMMEU alone has been slapped with more than $16 million on more than 2,000 contraventions of industrial laws in recent years—big fines. This is a terrible union. In 2017, the ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, in regards to industrial law, said, 'I don't think there's a problem with breaking it'. That's what she said. Well, there is a problem with breaking the law.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have Greens leader, Senator Di Natale, on Sunday saying that his party had a 'strong and proud tradition' of civil disobedience. He said: 'I'm the only member of the Greens that hasn't been arrested yet.' That is what he told <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span>. So I remind the member for Melbourne that we're supposed to make, not break, the law in this place. We are supposed to make the law, not break the law.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal-National government are proud of our delivery on infrastructure. We're spending $100 billion on infrastructure over the next decade. What we don't want to see is cost overruns caused by militant unions, caused by recklessness, caused by people breaking the law—whether they're the Greens or whether they're the unions. We make the laws; we shouldn't be breaking the laws. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I'm going to make a point that I make regularly, and it shocks me that I'm obviously not being clear enough. If members want me to hear the point of order to rule on it, it's very important that they don't yell uncontrollably and then demand I rule on the point of order. It's your question time. There's a time limit to it, essentially, and I'm not in a rush. All right? Leader of the House.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you for that time, Mr Speaker. Yesterday the member for Griffith asked a question that was a bit messy. It was a compound question; it had two parts. The first part sought confirmation that the minister had an interest in a company; the second part sought confirmation there had been or was some departmental investigation. The minister answered the second part first. He said he had no association—clearly meaning with the departmental investigation—and then he noted that he remained at arm's length from the company that was the subject of the question. There has never been any dispute that the minister has a relationship with the company and that is on the member's listed interests.</span>

In terms of what his answer was yesterday, the sentence that appears in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> is, 'I have no association and have remained at arm's length at all times from the company, Jam Land.'

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  Members on my left, I'm actually trying to listen to your Manager of Opposition Business. There are two issues here. Whether a question has been fully answered is not really for the chair to judge unless it's an identical question. I take the point that the Leader of the House is making that it's a very similar question. It is certainly the rule and indeed the practice that the question has to be absolutely identical—in other words, yesterday's question—for that to be the case. And then, if that were the case, yesterday's answer would have been deemed a full answer because the question has been answered. But it has not, so that question is in order. It's able to be asked, because it's different, but it's referring to yesterday's answer.</span>

The question wasn't identical to yesterday. Without being endlessly repetitive, I'm just telling the House that I can refer to a number of precedents, if that helps the Deputy Manager of Opposition Business. It might take up a bit of question time, though. I allowed the question. The minister has addressed the topic. He's still on the policy topic. I will just say concisely: what you can't do is ask a question and then essentially do the equivalent of having an answer you want him to read out. You can't do that. The rule for direct relevance came in in 2010. The Deputy Manager of Opposition Business has been around all of that time, and he's well aware of how that has operated with respect to the policy topic. The minister is in order. If he wishes to continue his answer, that's his business.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General, Minister for Industrial Relations and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:36</span>):  I thank the member for his question. Of course, we are concerned about that. There is a very important bill before this House today that would allow for a court to make a finding that a person was not a fit and proper person to be a public official for a union or, indeed, for an employer association. It applies to both of those instances. For instance, the court may make that finding that because the person in question had a significant history of breaking Australian civil law or because they had a history of breaking serious criminal laws that are punishable by two years or more of imprisonment. Ultimately, it must benefit employees, workers and all Australians who pay for infrastructure that the court has the discretion to disqualify a serious lawbreaker from holding a position of public office in a union.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has become obvious this week that the members opposite don't like being asked whose side they are on. Instead, why don't we ask who is on Labor's side? Is John Setka, the Victorian branch secretary of the CFMEU, on Labor's side? He was on the Labor team for a very, very long time. The Leader of the Opposition then said he was off the side. It now looks like he is back on the side and is going to be there for quite some period of time. The Leader of the Opposition said he would be gone by 5 July. The Leader of the Opposition even said that it was an open-and-shut case. Clearly he has been getting more legal advice from the shadow Attorney-General. Although he's batting better than his usual average, because he got the open part of the open-and-shut case right. It's just that the shut part was a little bit of a problem.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Well you're putting yourself on the line if he isn't thrown out, it makes you look pretty silly as leader.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember that 5 July was the deadline. The Leader of Opposition said 'that's right'. It is right, because he's still there. Why would it be the case that we would have one rule about what is a fit and proper person for the Labor Party but have a completely different rule for what is a fit and proper person to hold a public office in a union? Indeed, why would you oppose a bill that sought to put a test in place so that a court could actually determine what is a fit and proper person to hold public office?</span>

                  </a>  That's a good question. What is there to fear for the Labor Party? Perhaps it was identified by that very man—John Setka himself—when he said that he'd stop the CFMEU giving money to the Labor Party. As he said, it would be a 'big threat' to a lot of people. One response, Leader of the Opposition, is that you could get rid of that problem entirely by declining to take money from the CFMEU. There would then be nothing to worry about and nothing to fear. You could float through and see this person gotten rid of.</span>

                  </a>  The second very important bill before this House today is a bill that deals with workers' entitlement funds. It is meant to put a proper regulatory system around those workers' entitlement funds. Those funds are designed to keep safe and secure workers' money that may be needed in the future for things and events such as long service leave, sick leave or, very importantly, severance and redundancy payments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are nine large workers' entitlement funds in operation. Unfortunately, at present, they are the subject of very little proper regulation in terms of governance or transparency. The result of that absence of governance and transparency has not been in the best interests of workers and has involved the misappropriation of their wages. The financial statements, for instance, of the Electrical Trades Union of Victoria make note of one of the largest funds, which is known as Protect. Protect is a fund meant to hold the money of workers specifically to pay for future severance entitlement of workers. In the Electrical Trades Union of Victoria's financial year accounts ending 31 December 2017, under 'Other items' there is a heading that says 'Significant changes in the financial affairs' and there is listed a transfer of capital from Protect to the Electrical Trades Union. On page 2 of that report, it lists the amount of that capital transfer as $32 million—$32 million of workers' money put aside to pay for severance benefits sent to the Electrical Trades Union. That report describes the reason for this as that the ETU is a sponsor organisation of Protect. Thirty-two million dollars; that is some sponsorship deal. Cristiano Ronaldo was the biggest sponsorship deal in soccer history, and that was $31 million!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was $32 million worth of workers' money sent to the ETU. The written financial expenditure policies in this bill would stop that from happening. What on earth could that money be for? What is most fascinating about this racket—and that is exactly what it is—is that when you look at the same ETU document it notes that some proportion of that $32 million has been set back as a loan facility—listen to this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… to loan back the capital distributed to the ETU if Protect needs to recall the distribution to meet ongoing expenses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If there were an event where Protect needed to pay severance payments but didn't have enough money because it gave $32 million to the ETU, it could always ask for a loan. Why would you not support legislation to make that no longer able to happen? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

And we have been able to cancel 4,500 visas of people who are here as noncitizens and who have committed crimes against Australians. I want to update the House, because importantly—listen to this figure—we have now cancelled the visas of 229 outlaw motorcycle gang members. That is great for our country because these people are involved in some very bad activities. They are the biggest distributors of ice, amphetamines and otherwise unlawful substances in our country.

                  </a>  The CFMEU. The CFMEU. The problem, of course, is that, with cancelling the visas of those bikies, it now appears that there is a shortage of hired muscle to go onto the building sites for the CFMEU. This is a great dilemma. Could you imagine? They get the call at the bikie clubhouse. They're in the middle of an import that's come in. They're cutting the drugs up and this afternoon they've got a shift where they're going out to the local milk bar to extort money from mum and dad, the operator, and they get a call from John Setka: 'Could you go around to the local building site, break the arm of a couple of carpenters? They're not paying their extortion money to the local CFMEU rep!' The CFMEU must be paying big money to the bikies for this relationship to continue, given that the bikies are making significant money—huge margins—in the distribution of ice. Yet they still continue their association with John Setka and the CFMEU. I'll tell you what, Mr Speaker, do you know who else is continuing his association with John Setka and his many fellow travellers in the union movement? This Leader of the Opposition. What we know about this Leader of the Opposition is that he's in favour of something, he's against it; he's for something, he's against it. He is no better than the person that used to fill the seat that he now occupies. We know, having watched the Labor Party for many years, that the Labor Party has been happy to take $16 million from the CFMEU. The CFMEU gave $1 million to the left-wing GetUp! organisation. And let me tell you, the Labor Party is led by a weak leader—as weak, at least, as his predecessor. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

But we are going to get on. We are going to get on and we're going to build the Bridgewater Bridge. The fact is there are issues that Infrastructure Australia has identified with that particular project. There are some unresolved engineering issues; there are some cost factors. When we get those issues resolved—and we will, because we are a government that does things; we are a government that builds things—we will get on with that project, just like we will get on with other projects right throughout Tasmania.

He understands how important building and construction is to Queensland, and all of the members on this side of the House understand how important the building and construction industry is to the Australian economy. Last year alone, building and construction was worth about $141 billion—that's about 7½ per cent of GDP—and well over one million people were employed in the building and construction sector.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has always backed building and construction and the hardworking people in building and construction, and that's why we set up an industry watchdog. We established the Australian Building and Construction Commission in 2005. It's important to just do a little bit of a recap on why it was so necessary for us to establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission. The Cole royal commission uncovered some staggering examples of union thuggery within the industry. This included fraud, corruption, collusion and anticompetitive behaviour, unlawful work practices, violence and inappropriate industrial practice. The ABCC changed all of that. While it was in place, productivity grew by nine per cent. The Australian people were better off by about $7.5 billion annually.</span>

                  </a>  To the eternal shame of the Gillard-Labor government, they abolished the ABCC. And what happened? It was a return to the bad old days on the building and construction sites. The coalition had to fight tooth and nail to re-establish the industry watchdog, the ABCC, but Labor still didn't learn, because they took to the election last May that they would abolish the ABCC again. This is an appalling state of affairs for Australians and for the building and construction industry. The final word really needs to go to the people who actually work in the building and construction industry: the hardworking, quiet Australians. Their judgement on the unions is absolutely crystal clear: 25 years ago, 34 per cent of the construction workforce were members of a union and by 2016 that had dropped to 10 per cent—that says it all. If Labor were truly for the workers, they'd stop running the union agenda and they'd help us crack down on union officials who do the wrong thing. Unfortunately, the only thing Labor is interested in building is a power base for their union mates. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

You cannot build it all at once. When you're spending a record $100 billion on infrastructure, you can't spend it all in the one year, but we're getting on with building a better Corangamite. When you look at the investment that we're making in the electorate of the member who asked the question: over $100 million for the Warrnambool Line Upgrade; the duplication of the Princes Highway—and I appreciate the fact that the Leader of the Opposition and I have been as one when it comes to road safety and issues on the Princes Highway; I see him nodding—over $82 million for roads from Waurn Ponds to Winchelsea and $25 million for the Great Ocean Road Upgrade, which is so significant, because there are many people who want to go and see the Twelve Apostles and the beauty that is in that area. The fact is that we're getting on by spending $25 billion for upgrades.</span>

Whether it's rail or whether it's road, whether it's $1 million or whether it's $100 million, we're getting on with building our future—building the people of Australia's future: the Bridges Renewal Program in the Corangamite electorate, $4.3 million; blackspot funding, $6.8 million; and councils within the electorate of the member who asked the question have a 25 per cent increase in Roads to Recovery funding. That wouldn't have happened under those opposite, but it's happening under us. Mayors right throughout Australia are delighted. We've got the Mayor of North Burnett in the gallery. She came to see me this morning and expressed gratitude about roads funding, and we'll work with her to build even more infrastructure and better roads in the North Burnett Region.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Education</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  As I was saying, there are 10,341 small businesses in the electorate of Bass. Of these, the biggest industries are construction, agriculture—which the member for Bass knows extremely well—forestry and fishing. When it comes to small business, the Morrison government want to back small business. We're cutting taxes for small business, we're removing red tape for small business and we're opening up new trade opportunities for small business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing we're doing is protecting small business from union militancy, despite Labor fighting us every step of the way. Look at our record: we established the Australian Building and Construction Commission, a tough cop on the beat to ensure the rule of law applies on Australian building sites. This is in stark contrast to the Labor Party and their extensive history of backing the CFMMEU and their law-breaking activity. Labor want us to return to chaos by abolishing the ABCC.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We set up the Registered Organisations Commission to ensure that employee and employer organisations do the right thing by their members. We passed the corrupting benefits legislation, which again was opposed by Labor. It banned dodgy payments between registered organisation representatives and those they were bargaining with. We abolished the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, which saved 35,000 small businesses. It was opposed by those opposite. And let's not forget that those small businesses employ seven million hardworking Australians. We're on their side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the question is: what is the position of the Leader of the Opposition? How does the Leader of the Opposition explain supporting the expulsion of Mr Setka from the Labor Party but not supporting legislation that would, if Mr Setka continued his unlawful behaviour, see him being expelled from his position as a union official? That is the question that this question time needs an answer to, and it would be very good if the Leader of the Opposition went outside and answered that question. That is the question you need to answer.</span>

As I said in my previous answer, we are getting on over a phased process. That's the responsible way to roll out infrastructure. I appreciate that the member for Paterson is in a regional electorate. When Labor were last in government, regional spend was $404 million. That was for the electorate of Paterson and other regional electorates. We've doubled and then tripled that spend in our past two terms, and we'll now spend six times that amount over the next three years. Our budget over dedicated regional funds is $2.7 billion, increasing our spend of $1½ billion.</span>

Roads of Strategic Importance is an initiative that came up from this side of parliament, not that side, because that side is not interested in those vital regional linkages, that vital regional connectivity. The Hunter Expressway: $1.4 billion. But they are all connected in to Paterson. They are all making sure that people from Paterson, whom the member represents, are getting home sooner and safer. Cessnock Frame Drive Bridge replacement: $2 million. We're getting on with replacing those bridges to help productivity, to help create supply lines, to help create jobs and build a better future. The Black Spot Program, for the seat of the member who asked the question: $6.8 million for that program, which is going to help avoid road crashes. And the Kinnard Park upgrade for Wellington: $200,000. We are getting on with building a better Paterson. We're getting on with building a better future, getting on with building a better Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="242515" type="MemberAnswer">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Housing</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  I thank the member for Boothby for her question. I know that the member for Boothby, as is the Prime Minister—as is every single person on this side of the House—is committed to helping prospective first home buyers get back into the market. The Morrison government has a range of initiatives to support first home buyers who are trying to get onto the property ladder and trying to buy their first home. It's been very encouraging to see that, since the re-election of the Morrison government, confidence amongst first home buyers—indeed, confidence amongst all buyers—has improved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen green shoots in most of our major markets. Prices have stabilised in most of our capital cities and big population centres. Clearance rates are now up to 70 per cent, from a much lower position not long ago, and confidence on a range of indexes is improving, with the most recent being the ANZ Property Council index, with confidence rising by 13 points. This comes on top of 110,000 first home buyers entering the market in 2018, the highest level since 2009. It's no accident that that increase in first home buyers in 2018 followed our housing budget in the 2016-17 and 2018-19 budgets. It is delivering for first home buyers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of those initiatives was the First Home Super Saver Scheme, which is opposed by the Labor Party. The Labor Party went to the election saying they would abolish the First Home Super Saver Scheme that allows first home buyers a tax cut by salary sacrificing into super. Three-and-a-half-thousand Australians have been assisted in buying their first home with the First Home Super Saver Scheme, yet the Labor Party want to abolish it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're building on that outstanding work with the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme, which will start from 1 January next year and allow prospective first home buyers to buy a house with a five per cent deposit. After the Prime Minister's outstanding speech announcing that policy, Senator Kristina Keneally criticised that policy and then, three hours later, the member for McMahon adopted it. We're very, very pleased that the Labor Party were forced into supporting that policy, because it will allow even more first home buyers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked about other policies, by the member for Boothby. The only policies that the Labor Party took to the election with respect to housing was their housing taxes, abolishing negative gearing, doubling capital gains tax, making it harder for first home buyers, pushing up rents. Let's remember, 30 per cent of people rent, yet the Labor Party had a policy designed to push up rents. So it's the member for Boothby, it's the Prime Minister, it's members on this side of the House who are dedicated to ensuring that we make it easier for first home buyers to get into the property market, and we're already seeing results.</span>

In the last parliament, the 45th Parliament, the now opposition leader, the member for Grayndler, couldn't get a question because the member for Maribyrnong wouldn't give him one. But we're getting question after question today, which shows the renewed focus on infrastructure and the enthusiasm about our record spend—$100 billion of infrastructure that we're spending over the next 10 years. So there's a plan. It's got to have project management. There is a vision, by this side and hopefully now endorsed by that side, for infrastructure rollout over the next decade. But, member for Gilmore, you can't do it all in the first year. You can't do it all in the second year. It's got to be phased. You've got to have a plan. You've got to have vision.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there's not much planning or vision over that side—and that's why you are over that side—but the member for Gilmore should be very, very pleased that we are getting on with building projects in the Gilmore electorate such as the Nowra Bridge. It's $155 million that we've allocated. And when we say allocated, we will build it. We will. The Princes Highway corridor: $500 million allocated. The Eurobodalla roads upgrade: $9 million. The Shoalhaven River bridge planning: $10 million; we'll do the planning and then we'll build the bridge. We'll make sure the feasibility study comes back and we'll make sure the right planning is done. We'll get on and we'll build it—high-vis workers, making sure we've got those excavators on the ground.</span>

The bridges renewal program, for the member who asked the question: $2.4 million. For the blackspot program, the member will be very pleased to know, there's $20 million being spent in her electorate. But her electorate, I have to say, is also going to be the beneficiary of tax relief, thanks to the fact that the Liberals and the Nationals were returned to government on—</span>

If the government, the opposition and the Independents want to change the arrangements, that's their business. I have to operate under the standing orders, and I can only call someone who's jumped. That's all I can do. I can't be randomly asking people to jump. So, the member for Moreton has the call.</span>

On that question, when he talks about taxation, he's on a different topic and it's entirely irrelevant. I spend a lot of time deciding what's directly relevant, but that's one of the easiest ones I've had today.</span>

                  </a>  I thought you gave me a bit of leeway, but that is fair enough, Mr Speaker. In 2010, Labor promised to fix Orrong Road but never did it. That's typical of Labor because they often promised and never did it—made a lot of promises, went to elections making a lot of commitments, never, ever kept them. The member for Moreton will be pleased to know, though, that $500 million is being spent on the M1 motorway, Eight Mile Plains to Daisy Hill. He'll be very pleased to know that the Ipswich Motorway—Rocklea to Darra—$200 million. We're spending—are you going to make up your mind who wants to stand up?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  I don't need to hear a point of order. Look, I've said twice now to the Deputy Prime Minister: he needs to confine himself to the policy topic. If he's talking about infrastructure, I'm being very generous in allowing that policy topic to be confined to the electorate. It was a very specific question. I'm out of patience on it. He can do what he did in the first couple of answers where I defended his right to do it. If he's going to stray and ask for extra leeway, what he's asking for is for me to ignore the practice, and I'm not going to do that. The Deputy Prime Minister has the call.</span>

The Deputy Prime Minister, provided he's confining himself to your electorate, I think is in order. It's certainly what I have allowed today.</span>

                  </a>  That's why we're spending record amounts of money on black spot funding, record amounts of money on level crossings, record amounts of money on bridge replacements and record amounts of money on the Roads to Recovery program. More than 500 councils right across the country are getting an extra 25 per cent for Roads to Recovery. I'd be happy to come to the member for Moreton's electorate and look at the particular crossing to which he refers, because we are making sure, whether it's urban or regional, we're busting congestion. Particularly in urban areas, we're spending $4 billion on busting through congestion. I appreciate that it is a 10-year build. It's a 10-year build of $100 billion.</span>

We all know that at the last election this government went to the people saying that we would work hard to make sure that we kept our border secure and to make sure that we kept our country safe. We have done that over a number of years. We've now been able to introduce 17 tranches of national security legislation designed to keep Australians safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said yesterday—and I'll repeat it again today—no Australian should be complacent about the threat to us as a Western democracy. We've seen terrible, horrific attacks where people have lost their lives in all parts of the world, where extremists have undertaken reprehensible actions that have resulted in a loss of life. We have been in a position where we have had a debate, as people will be aware, around temporary exclusion orders, which allows the minister of the day to temporarily exclude for a period of up to two years an Australian citizen who is suspected of fighting for ISIL or being involved in a terrorism cause. We can manage their return back to our country in that arrangement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have sought the support of Labor over a period of time for this important bill. The Labor Party has been in favour of it. They've been against it. They've been in between. The fact is that last night, when this bill was debated in the chamber, the shadow Attorney-General, the member for Isaacs, argued that the bill was unconstitutional. He moved 41 amendments. In the end, when he realised we had the votes in the Senate to pass this bill, what did he do? He folded and voted for the bill—a bill that he said was fundamentally flawed, unconstitutional and required 41 amendments. He didn't get up one amendment. The bill is not in an amended form.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How can people look to the Labor Party and have any idea of what they stand for? Earlier this week, we saw the Labor Party in favour of tax cuts and against tax cuts and eventually vote for tax cuts only when they realised that we had the support of those in the other place. They've done the same on drought assistance. They are for it. They are against it. They're in between. Who knows where this Leader of the Opposition stands? Who knows what he stands for? But we do know he's not consistent when it comes to the most important test of any leader in this place: whether they have a consistent approach to national security. This Leader of the Opposition is at least as weak as any of his predecessors in this place in recent history, and he's demonstrated that in the last 24 hours. You cannot have a position where you are for, against and in between it and then ultimately fold. People don't cop that. People have found you out. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In question time today, the minister of energy, in response to my question concerning his relationship to the company Jam Land Pty Ltd, stated that he had a strong interest and was representing the farmers of his electorate. He identified that electorate as encompassing the Monaro and then stated that I had not represented the interests of the farmers of the Monaro. Firstly, of course, the Monaro is not in Hume. Secondly, I had caused my staff to research whether or not there had been any issues raised with me concerning this grasslands issue at the heart of this matter. We have not received a single concern from any constituent in Eden-Monaro. The only concerns that have been raised with my office have been in relation to the minister's behaviour.</span>

I presume the member for Chifley is referring to the answer that was just made. I felt it was short and concise. I concede that, at one level, it was close to the line, but what the minister did was anchor it on the two figures. I felt he explained how the $16 million figure was wrong. In fact, it was $11 million, and he explained what the $16 million figure was. If the minister had gone on to try to have an answer, I certainly would have pulled him up.</span>

                  <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:39</span>):  The coalition like to tell us that they're about tradition, but this government is establishing a new tradition. They win power and then they don't know what to do with it. They're like the dog that catches the car. Tony Abbott, the first Prime Minister of the ATM government, was a Rottweiler. He knew how to bark. He barked, 'No, no, no,' to everything. He turned the coalition into the 'no-alition'. What happened was that, when he got to government, he had no plan to actually govern. He had no positive agenda. He acted like an opposition leader in exile on the government benches.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We then had Malcolm Turnbull. He had one idea, which was to become Prime Minister. That was his only idea. He gave up all of his ideas and values that he'd held over decades, such as support for climate change and being strong about recognising people in same-sex relationships. He abandoned all of his values and beliefs in order to secure that position. He even abandoned his commitment to an Australian republic. The member for Dickson stepped forward. He had three ideas. To become PM was the first one. He was going to smile more—remember that? But he had a third idea that was really bad. It was to outsource his numbers to the Minister for Finance. Step sideways, and we have the current Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is some considerable irony in this Prime Minister—who keeps talking about which side you are on, including about national security—attempting to argue that, somehow, one side of this chamber is more serious about tackling terrorism than the other. It is totally divisive nonsense and quite clearly not in the national interest. Also, I have to say, it is a poor choice of words from a bloke who stood next to Malcolm Turnbull at the Prime Minister's office and said, 'I'm on his side!' We know how that ended up. As Niki Savva's book <span style="font-style:italic;">Plots and Prayers</span> demonstrates, this was at the very same time as Mr Morrison's supporters were tactically voting for the member for Dickson, Peter Dutton, in order to undermine the very Prime Minister who they were saying that they were supporting out there. We won't be taking lessons from this turncoat, who sits in this chair, whose integrity is skewered so effectively by Savva's detailed analysis in that book, which is from direct Liberal Party sources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're stuck with now is a third-term government with no agenda. We have the busted ATM government. They have no output and are wondering what to do. The clue is in the first two syllables of the word 'government'. It's gov-ern. That's what they should be doing. But they have no plan for economic growth, they have no plan for lifting consumer demand, they have no plan for productivity and they have no plan for dealing with the skills crisis. They certainly don't have a plan to deal with the recommendations that remain outstanding from the banking royal commission, as we saw today. They have no legislation to put forward before the House. They just sit on their hands over there with that born-to-rule mentality that they have, which they have been raised with from birth. They think that they have a right to rule and that working people should just know their place. We saw that with attack after attack on the trade union movement in this chamber today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They don't have a plan for climate change. There's no energy policy still. They come out with rhetoric from the back bench—remember that coal-fired power station that's going to be built—but nothing actually happens. They then have said that they're going to go nuclear. They're going to have nuclear power plants, but they won't be just anywhere. I'll give you a clue: they can be somewhere where there's water. That's right around the coast and right around the rivers. We're waiting for one of the members opposite to put their hand up and say that they want a nuclear power plant in their electorate. They say they support dams, but they haven't built one. But they are upholding some tradition. John Howard said, when Prime Minister, that 'they've never had it so good'. Do you remember that?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Petrie, of course, has cranked it up a notch, because he has said, as the minister responsible for homelessness, that homelessness needs a positive spin. He's gone on about the vacant properties that are there as the evidence. Well, it's hard not to think that there's a vacant property above the member for Petrie's shoulders! Maybe that's what he's referring to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who else wants to play 'You've never had it so good'? The person responsible for pensioners—come on down, Senator Ruston!—said that for pensioners to receive $66 a day is generous. That's what she said. And the next contestant: down lumbers the member for Hughes. He doesn't think pensioners have ever had it so good; he thinks they've had it too good! He wants the family home to be included in the pension assets test. For a mob who talk about retirees, they don't like pensioners. They now want to cut super rather than increase it to 12 per cent—the Liberals retiree tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This follows the short-changing of pensioners through not worrying about deeming rates until there have been five decreases in interest rates by the Reserve Bank. This is the same mob that changed the pension assets test, in conjunction with the Greens, which led to 88,000 pensioners losing their pension and 370,000 pensioners having their pension cut. They tried to scrap the energy supplement. They cut $1 billion from pensioner concessions in 2004. The one thing that you won't hear from this Prime Minister is, 'How good are pensioners?'—because he doesn't defend them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who else is out of touch? The Deputy Prime Minister says that if people are struggling for work then they should just move—move away from their community or move away from the connections that they have. Say what you like about his predecessor, Barnaby Joyce, the member for New England: he moved from St George to Tamworth to chase a job opportunity. He took it to heart, but that hasn't worked out all that well!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that is arrogant and out of touch. They have forgotten that it is their responsibility to govern. In the lead-up to just the second parliamentary sitting week, what did they say about the legislation they were introducing before this parliament? It was not that it was in the national interest, not that it was going to drive economic growth, not that it was going to create jobs, not that it was going to create social equity and not that it was going to deal with the environmental challenges in this country. What they said was that it was a test for Labor. It was all about them once again acting like an opposition in exile, a government in search of an agenda, a government in its third term searching for a reason for its very existence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, on the second day of the second sitting week of the 46th Parliament, the Senate ran out of business—no agenda. Imagine seeking political power just so you can get in white cars and sit on the ministerial benches, not so that you can change the country for the better, not so that you can make a difference to people's lives. That's the problem with those opposite. They define themselves by what they're against. We know they're against unions. We know they're against staff. But the problem is that they're against the Australian people when it comes to the need to lift living standards, the need to address the very significant challenges that are before this country at the moment. So they're sitting over there, after six years, three prime ministers, three deputy prime ministers and countless numbers on the front bench, and all they do is spit the dummy when Labor actually chooses—has the temerity—to question legislation and to try to improve it. Their very reason for existence is a question mark that's not just before us and before the nation but before themselves. We see that every answer in question time, year after year, starts with, 'Well, what Labor is doing'—what the other side are doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They need to create a positive agenda because they're presiding over an economy that is flatlining, an economy where interest rates are at one-third of the level they were at the GFC, an economy with low consumer demand, an economy with real issues with regard to security at work and an economy with productivity growth going backwards. This is a government in search of an agenda, and it needs to start acting like it rather than like an opposition in exile. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TUDGE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:50</span>):  It does not surprise me that the Labor Party does not understand our agenda, because, throughout the entire federal campaign and, indeed, for the months before the federal election, they were effectively on their coronation tour. They were just zipping around the country, waving in their regal way, doing their lap of honour, so confident that they were going to be on this side of the House that they barely bothered to look at the positive plans which the coalition was putting forward to the Australian people. I want to use my time today to talk about some of those positive plans that we've already enacted and that we will continue to enact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that I noticed about the Leader of the Opposition's commentary and, indeed, the nature of this MPI in and of itself is that, effectively, they are saying to the Australian people, 'You got it wrong at the election.' 'We deserve to win,' they're saying. 'Look at that rabble. Why did you vote for them?' Well, can I tell you what? They did vote for the coalition. The quiet Australians supported us. They supported our agenda and they didn't want the Labor agenda. The Labor Party shouldn't be so arrogant, as they've been displaying today, given that the vote which the Labor Party got at the federal election, despite their arrogance, despite the coronation tour, was actually the lowest in 100 years. I reckon that, if you're a political party that has got the lowest primary vote in 100 years, you would be a bit less arrogant than this Labor Party is today and maybe a little bit more humble in terms of listening to the election result and listening to the Australian people about what they actually wanted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And they did not want the high-taxing agenda which the Labor Party was promising. They did not want weak borders, which the Labor Party was promising. They did not want rents to go up. They did not want the housing market to collapse, which the Labor Party was promising. Rather, they wanted the agenda which we put forward: to keep the economy strong, to build infrastructure, to provide record funding in health and education, to continue to fund more medicines, to continue to keep our borders secure—I could go on. And I will go on in my remaining time and detail some of these plans that we actually did offer the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr TUDGE:</span>
                  </a>  Listen to them now. They're still laughing. They're still, effectively, laughing at the Australian people. The Australian people backed this plan, and the arrogance of the Labor Party to still be laughing at the things which we offered the Australian people just two months ago, which they supported and supported around the country—and we know how strongly people supported this plan in Queensland in particular. They wanted energy security. They wanted jobs up there, and that's what we were offering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at some of our economic plans. We took to the election one of the biggest economic tax relief agendas in many elections. We wanted to lower taxes for 94 per cent of all Australians, with a particular focus on the low- and middle-income earners immediately. And so what have we done? The first bill that we took into this parliament once we were elected was precisely that bill—the bill which the Labor Party opposed. And that is delivering over $1,000 to every individual on lower and medium incomes right now as soon as they put in their tax returns. As the Treasurer has outlined, a great many people have already done that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're backing small business as well by lowering their taxes and extending the instant asset write-off. People who have been following the debate would know that just in the last couple of days we have backed our farmers as well, because our farmers are doing it particularly tough because of the drought. As members who have been listening closely would know, we have spent the last two days setting up a drought fund so that there will be money both now and in the future for when drought inevitably occurs in this great wide country of ours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll tell you what else we're going to do. We, over the next three years and beyond, will be investing record amounts in infrastructure right across the country. We announced in the budget this year, just a month or two before the election, a $100 billion infrastructure plan. That was an increase from just 12 months earlier, when we announced a record $75 billion. You say we don't have an infrastructure plan. I think you are just deliberately turning your ears and eyes off. There is $100 billion and we have 150 major projects going on as we speak, with a further 150 major projects being planned that will be delivered in the very short term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just two weeks ago we opened the M4 tunnel for WestConnex. This is a project that will take 10,000 trucks off Parramatta Road. It's a project that will save people who live in Parramatta today and drive into the city 40 minutes every single day—20 minutes each way. Do you know what the opposition said in relation to this multi-billion-dollar project? They said that they're not supporting it because it's 'a road to nowhere'. Do you know where it goes? It goes to the western suburbs of Sydney. We don't think that's a road to nowhere, but the Leader of the Opposition said precisely that just two years ago. He said that, if he became infrastructure minister, he would not put a cent towards that $16 billion game-changing project in Western Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another great project in Western Sydney that is underway as we speak is Western Sydney Airport. Already a billion cubic metres of dirt have been moved, and this project will be the single largest earthmoving project in Australian history, finally delivering a second international airport in the western suburbs of Sydney. Again, it's a massive project that the Labor Party, despite indicating they might support it, just could not get around to supporting. In my home state of Victoria, and in Melbourne in particular, we're getting the Melbourne Airport Rail Link finally done. This is a project that, again, should have been done probably two or three decades ago. Which government is actually going to deliver it? It is this government, with $5 billion on the table, ready to go. In South Australia, we've got the North-South Corridor—again, investing billions of dollars. In Western Australia, we've got the Metronet. We're investing more and more there. We've got the Tonkin Highway upgrades. In Queensland, we've got the M1 upgrades. We've got 166 Urban Congestion Fund projects, and I'm negotiating for state ministers right now to get those up and running and delivered over the next few years. This is a real agenda to make a real difference to people's lives, just as that WestConnex project, which the Labor Party opposed, is doing right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What if we talk about the environment? We've got our emissions reduction targets, which we are going well on. We're tracking towards a 28 per cent reduction by 2030. We'll meet our 2020 target—in fact, we'll beat our 2020 target—and we'll commit to our Paris commitments, which we will deliver on. On the health agenda, record funding is going to hospitals over the next few years. And we will continue to list a record number of medicines on the PBS. They are absolutely life-changing medicines, literally, for tens of thousands of people around this country. The government are doing it because we're able to manage the economy, run a budget surplus and fund more medicines, whereas the Labor Party had to stop funding medicines because they ran out of money. That is the absolute truth. This government runs a strong economy so that we can do things like fund medicines and make absolutely life-changing differences to people who can now afford some of the medicines that they could otherwise not afford.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the education space, we continue to invest record amounts to schools right across the country. Ten thousand schools—every single one—are getting record amounts of funding. Guess how we do that. Again, by running a strong economy. In relation to national security, one of the first items of business is to reverse the bill that the Labor Party supported, with the crossbench, to make it much easier for illegal arrivals to come to this country. We have always been strong on border protection. We will continue to be strong on border protection, and that will be an ongoing agenda item. I could go on all afternoon in relation to our agenda, but the truth of the matter is: the quiet Australians supported us, and they did not support the Australian Labor Party.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  The parliament recently paid tribute to one of Australia's greatest Prime Ministers, Bob Hawke. Bob Hawke loved Australia and Australians loved Hawkey. One of the reasons that they loved Bob Hawke was that he united Australians, brought us together and gave us hope. In fact, his '83 election campaign slogan was 'Bringing Australians together', and that is exactly what Bob Hawke did. As a result, Australians felt confident and proud. He united our nation and gave Australians hope.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's in stark contrast to the approach of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, which has been governing based on fear and division, setting Australians against each other. How many times have you heard this Prime Minister say, in respect of a piece of legislation or a policy, 'Whose side are you on?' trying to divide Australia and set Australians against each other? There's been not one piece of positive reform or legislation or plan to deal with the huge challenges facing us as a nation at the moment. Those opposite are more interested in wedging the Labor Party and playing politics in this place than in governing in the interests of all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that is self-obsessed and asleep at the wheel. You only need look at its approach to energy policy to see that that is a fact. After six years—six years—in government, those opposite still do not have a national energy policy. I had to laugh recently when the member for Hughes was asked in the media why the government doesn't have a national energy policy. His response was, 'Because the Labor Party is promoting renewable energy.' Can you believe it? After six years, they are still blaming the Labor Party for the fact that they cannot get their act together and they cannot end this war between the flat-earthers—the climate change deniers, which are in the majority in this government—and those that are more moderate over whether or not climate change is real and whether we should be reducing emissions in our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have had six different energy policies. We all remember the clean energy target, mark 1 and mark 2. They hit the fence pretty quick after Tony Abbott, the former member for Warringah, started advocating against them. Then we had the National Energy Guarantee, mark 1 and mark 2. I'll give the former Prime Minister his credit—he actually got the National Energy Guarantee through the coalition party room. They agreed to it. So instead of getting rid of the policy, they got rid of the Prime Minister. That's how unbelieving they are about climate change: they got rid of the Prime Minister! Then 'the big stick' was introduced—that hit the fence as well. And now they've come up with a divestment power, which they still haven't brought to the parliament. After six years there's still no energy policy, and it's Australian families, pensioners and small businesses that have paid the price for the division and chaos of this government, through skyrocketing electricity prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an economy that is floundering under this government's watch, with the slowest economic growth since the global financial crisis and the longest per-capita recession since 1982. Wages and incomes aren't growing at all and are growing eight times slower than profits. We've got rising unemployment and youth unemployment, five years of weak productivity growth, weak household spending, falling consumer confidence and shockingly bad business conditions. If you go down any main street of any town in Australia and ask those small businesses how they're feeling about business conditions at the moment, the answer will always come back that they've never felt so bad. The saddest indictment on this government is that living standards for Australians have not been growing as fast as they were under a Labor government. And the largest indictment of all—and this says everything about this government's management of our economy: the Australian economy was the eighth-fastest-growing economy in the OECD in 2013; as a result of this government's mismanagement, at this point in time Australia is the 20th-fastest-growing economy in the OECD. We've fallen from eighth under the Labor Party to 20th under this government. Within every element of Australian society, people are struggling—young Australians, pensioners, families, small businesses, people with a disability, the unemployed and those waiting for aged-care places. The only people that have been doing well are those in big business. And is it any wonder that those opposite voted 26 times against a banking royal commission, because we know whose side they are on. Despite the shock and outrage that Australians saw, regarding the royal commission, not one piece of legislation to implement the royal commission recommendations has been brought into this parliament. It says everything about this government. They are more interested in dividing and wedging the Labor Party, and dividing based on fear and chaos, than in governing in the interests of all Australians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245550" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms FLINT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:05</span>):  We on this side of the House took a very positive plan to the 18 May election, and I'm really proud of that plan. It was a positive plan, and we ran a very positive campaign. I wish we could say the same for those opposite, and I will certainly be saying a lot about that in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really pleased to speak on this matter today, because when it comes to advancing a positive agenda for the Australian people, for our nation and for the national interest it is the Morrison government that comes to mind. But don't take my word for it. If we cast our minds back just a few months, it was the Australian people who backed our positive plan for the nation. Our government took our plan to the Australian people, and the Australian people gave us responsibility for implementing our agenda. And that's exactly what we're doing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't think of a more positive agenda for Australia than delivering tax relief for hardworking Australians, leaving more of the money that they have worked hard to earn in their pockets. They're the best people to spend their money. It's our government that delivered immediate tax relief for low- and middle-income earners as soon as we got back to parliament, and I'm incredibly proud that we did that. More than 10 million workers will receive a tax offset when they do their tax return this year, with around 4.5 million people who are hardworking Australians receiving the full amount of just over $1,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also delivering short-, medium- and long-term reform to our tax system, which means that by the time our tax relief plan is fully implemented 94 per cent of taxpayers will pay no more than 30 cents in the dollar. To me, that sounds exactly like advancing a positive agenda for the nation and a positive agenda for hardworking Australians. But our tax plan won't just reward hardworking Australians; it will also strengthen our economy. And we know why a strong economy matters. A strong economy means we can afford to guarantee the essential services that all Australians rely on, whether that's education, health care, delivering important infrastructure upgrades or looking after our environment. On health, for example, it means record funding for Medicare, a fully funded NDIS with no increase to the Medicare levy to deliver that, and funding for more than 2,000 new life-changing and live-saving medicines worth more than $10 billion on the PBS. That is what we have delivered and are delivering for the Australian people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The local residents in my electorate of Boothby are directly seeing the benefits of our health funding firsthand at the old Repatriation General Hospital site in Daw Park, which is in the heart of my electorate and is very much the heart of my electorate. This is a very significant hospital precinct for my community. It's a place where, for generations, veterans who have made the ultimate sacrifice or put their hand up to make the ultimate sacrifice for our country have gone for treatment. It's a place that's very dear to their heart, and it's a place that was closed down by the former state Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, everyone on that side of this place, particularly those South Australian federal members, stood by and watched the former Weatherill Labor government shut down the repat, much to the great distress of my community, particularly the veterans community. I'm incredibly proud that the Morrison and Marshall Liberal governments are reactivating the repat hospital. This is an incredibly positive thing to do for my community, and I can't wait to see the building soon commence. The federal government is providing more than $40 million of funding towards reactivating the precinct, which will support a state-of-the-art brain and spinal injury unit at the site.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're putting our specialist dementia care unit for South Australia there, to care for some of our most vulnerable citizens. It is absolutely critical that they are in a place that is safe, where they will be provided with a wonderful level of care and they will never again be out of sight or out of mind. We are also establishing a residential eating-disorder unit there, which we know is desperately needed. Also, we will be placing a brand-new veterans wellbeing centre there, which I'm working on very closely with my veterans community. These are just some of the very positive things the Morrison government is delivering for hardworking Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  This is the sixth sitting day since the election. When you consider that one of the days was filled by the normal procedures that happen with a new parliament, it's only five sitting days. I sit here and reflect on what would have happened if there had been a different election outcome. Of course, we respect the outcome, but I think we would have a front bench of ministers doing a whole lot of work—for example, in the education sector. There would have been a whole lot of work on rolling out legislation and commitments on childcare services, early childhood education opportunities, rebuilding the financing around school education, and significant major reform in the post-secondary education sector. There would have been a health minister looking at rolling out our pensioner dental plan and initiatives such as cancer reform. But we didn't win the election; those on the other side did. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look at them and I think: what are they doing? Five sitting days! I have to keep googling to make sure I'm actually in the 46th Parliament, because you would be forgiven for thinking that, in some horrendous time warp, we had all come back and were sitting in the 45th Parliament. We came into question time and the government said: 'How are we going to fill the time?' As the Leader of the Opposition said, 'We caught the car we didn't expect to catch: how are we going to fill the time? Go and check out some legislation we couldn't get through the 45th Parliament. We'll roll that out and see if we can have another shot at that. It was really good, because by making it the debate in this place'—the peak, leadership body for legislating, decision-making and policymaking in the nation—'we could spend all the time, resources and energy, and the privilege we have of being here, on having another round of "Let's bash the Labor Party"'. That's apparently all that is in the national interest. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an emergency to pass drought policy so that those opposite could take a quick and easy shot and say that Labor opposes drought support for farmers—a policy you're not even starting to pay out for another 12 months. It gave you a full day to spend all your time, energy and resources, and the responsibility and privilege you have in sitting on those benches, taking a cheap shot at us. That's what it was about. Today we've had a whole lot of questions on militant unions. Good grief! You spent the whole 45th Parliament talking about that; now you're going to waste the whole 46th Parliament talking about that. This is an absolute abrogation of your responsibility. As so many of you opposite have said, you did win the election. The Australian people have given you this great privilege to put forward an agenda that is about their interests. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had two sort of conflicting stories from those opposite. We have a whole lot of people getting up and saying, 'Everything is great. Look how good we are. Look how successful we've been with the economy.' Every now and then, when they want to do something like tax cuts, they'll get up and say, 'Oh, headwinds in the economy—things are getting a bit difficult. We need to be able to do something about it.' Let me tell you, there are serious issues facing people in our economy. In my community, in communities all around the country, people are not spending. There's a real crisis in confidence. Wages have flatlined. People are concerned about their capacity to continue to meet the costs of living. These are the sorts of things that you should be turning your minds to. To be quite honest, from some of the speeches I hear, I would say some of the backbenchers want to be talking about that. But this frontbench—and you should be taking them to task for this—are using all their opportunities, particularly in debates like question time, and their whole strategy, in their whole messaging to the people of this nation, is to have cheap shots at us about anything they can. That is not national leadership. That is not working in the best interests of this nation. That is not governing for the best interests of the people who we have the privilege to represent in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Politics is a contest. Sometimes you'll disagree with us and you'll have a shot at us. It goes back again with our feelings about your policies. That's a wholly different case to expending all your time and energy, all your focus, all your resources, all your conversations in this place and every opportunity in this place to simply wedge Labor instead of doing your job.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you. I was going for that. Their arguments have been almost as thin as a homeopathic soup made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that starved to death. This is terrible. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Is this a government that isn't doing it? In my own electorate we have a new $1½ billion hospital, a $1 billion road, $250 million for road widening, $2 million for a surf-lifesaving club, $1.5 million for a new clubhouse for the football association—which I'm informed is not soccer—$500,000 for solar panels on golf clubs, a 62 per cent increase in education funding per student in public schools, and two kids in Terrey Hills now able to afford lifesaving drugs and able to live full lives because of the management of this government and its ability to put lifesaving drugs on the PBS. That is what government is about. That's what hope is about. That is what opportunity is about. That's what government looks like when you're not always asking a focus group how to run your party. It's just appalling. You should all be ashamed of yourselves. I'm sorry, there I go again being critical of you. Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This MPI is a blunder so epic it requires an orchestra to introduce it. It needs one of the orchestras that they had for <span style="font-style:italic;">Star Wars</span>. We've found in the last five days that the Labor Party want to talk about us because they are in favour of increased taxes but are against drought relief. It's like an episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Vicar of Dibley</span>—'No, no, no, yes. We were in favour.' Then we had on border security, 'No, no, no. It's so bad. It's unconstitutional, but yes.' This is what we have from the Labor Party—no ideas and no clues. They are about to fall in over themselves. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is one thing that they will stand up for—trade union officials who break the law. Anyone watching Sky today would have seen the President of the ACTU claiming that it is unions that stop wage theft, especially in the restaurant industry. She was asked, 'What did you guys do around that theft?' She said: 'There were lots of people involved, lots of players involved. We were there. We did something. We saw it happening.' Then there was: 'But we were told that the workers rang the union and the union didn't return the phone calls. Is that right?' She said: 'Yes. Well, that can happen sometimes. They're very busy.' Isn't that why they finally went to the Fair Work Ombudsman, an ombudsman whose budget you, the Labor Party, cut by 20 per cent? You guys say you believe in all this stuff, but all you want to do is sound good; you don't actually want to do any good. It's a compare-and-contrast situation. When you guys were in government, you did a horrible job. You led on debt and deficit. You led an economy that was going down the drain. You did nothing about protecting workers, and you did nothing about lawlessness on Australian worksites. You're still in here claiming you're an opposition, but you're not even that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  Nothing illustrates the premise of the question better than that risible contribution from the member for Mackellar. This truly is a government without purpose. The member for Mackellar had five minutes to talk about the purpose, achievements and agenda of this government, and all he spent five minutes doing was saying, 'Labor, Labor, Labor.' It is absolutely tiresome. It's tiresome for me, I know it's tiresome for the gallery and it's tiresome for the people of Australia. They expect a government that is going to govern in their interests and stop talking about the opposition and start talking about a positive plan for the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the contribution from the member for Boothby where I think she was having a little game with herself, seeing how many times she could say the word 'positive'. She said, 'We have a positive plan.' What was the positive plan? I was sitting here waiting to hear what the positive plan was, and it never emerged. I think she said 'positive' about 10 times in that speech—I'm happy to be corrected—but she never once said what the positive plan was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are at nine weeks after the election. It is nine weeks after the election in which the Australian people gave the government members the benefit of the doubt and gave them another term. We accept that. That was the will of the Australian people. We're two weeks into the 46th Parliament and this is a government so bereft of any ideas that just the other night, in the second week of this parliament, it ran out of legislation in the Senate. It sent the Senate home early—lights off, click, dark night, everybody home. That's the story of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was certainly the story of this government in the 45th Parliament, where we had it running out of legislation and members racking off to the airport early—lazy, no work ethic, all spin and all politics. Those opposite and their backers on late-night pay TV like to parrot, for example, how good they are at managing the economy. That's what they hang everything on. If it's not fear and smear with national security, it's the strong economy and what great economic managers they are. Well, let's look at the facts. The fact is that, under the Liberals, net debt has more than doubled since Labor left office. Labor did leave a debt. We make no apology for that. We left a debt because we had to contend with the global financial crisis that smashed the world economy. Labor kept Australia on an even keel economically, and that cost money to do. Every world economist praised Labor's management of the economy at that time. Since 2013, there's been no global financial crisis and yet this government has more than doubled net debt in rosy economic times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What else tells the story of the economic agenda of this government? Supposedly, according to the member for Mackellar and his colleagues, Labor was a shockingly bad economic manager. In 2013, when Labor left office, we were the eighth-fastest-growing economy in the world. Australia was the eighth-fastest-growing economy when we left those opposite the economy. What is it now? After six years of economic global sunshine, we're now the 20th fastest. After six years of Liberal government, we have gone down that scale.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are some other facts. Gross debt is at record highs under this government. Both kinds of debt are growing at a faster clip on the Liberals' watch than under the previous Labor government, and we had the global financial crisis to deal with. The state of the economy under the Liberals is concerning, with the slowest economic growth since the global financial crisis, the longest per capita recession since the 1982 recession, stagnant and flatlined wages that are eight times slower than profits, and corporate profits growing at eight times the rate of wages. The nexus is broken. The fairness trajectory is broken. Wages once kept pace with profits and that is now broken. Workers are doing the work and not getting a fair pay for it under this government. Rising underemployment, rising youth unemployment, slowing employment growth, five years of weak productivity growth, weak household spending, falling consumer confidence—the list of the failures of economic management from six years of a Liberal government goes on and on. And what do we have in this contribution from those opposite? There is not one word about their plans to tackle the economic mess under their government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="148150" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PITT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:25</span>):  I rise to start with an admission: I will admit that the member for Grayndler actually got up my nose. It's pretty rare in this place that something will actually annoy me to this point, but it tends to be what the Labor Party has done, particularly in the last election. It's this announcement, this class separation, this attack that we on this side of the parliament don't represent working people, that we have a born-to-rule mentality. I can tell you that I'm an electrician. My brothers are harvesting contractors. They are teachers. One has had an epiphany and gone back to university. My father was a timber cutter. Those on that side stand there and say we don't represent working people. We are working people! I can tell you that the people of Queensland in particular are on to you, because in my electorate, at the last election, your primary vote dropped to 22 per cent, so your class warfare tactics quite simply did not work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the values they espouse are not the ones that they believe in. The people of Australia agree. It is why they didn't vote for them at the last election. The Labor Party had their opportunity. They took their agenda to the people, as we did. They were defeated. The question that the member for Grayndler comes up with all the time is: which side are you on? Well, you're on the opposition side and have been for three terms. There is a reason for that; you are not putting forward an agenda that people agree with. We have had an election. There has been an outcome. The people have agreed with the agenda we have put forward. So I say to you on the opposite side: stop the class warfare. It does you no good. In fact, it is alienating the people who had voted for you for decades. All of those individuals who go to work in their steel-capped boots and hi-vis shirts who used to vote for you now vote for us. It is quite straightforward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear from the opposition constantly about Bob Hawke. They keep bringing up the issue of Bob. I admit Bob was a very popular Prime Minister. One of the things that were spoken about the former Prime Minister Bob Hawke was something that was raised once again by the member for Grayndler: that the former Prime Minister had said to him, 'Don't be afraid of risk.' And yet we continue to see those on the opposite side continuing with their attacks on working-class people, their attacks on class systems. It is absolutely wrong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of what we are doing as a government, we are delivering and we continue to deliver. In fact, we delivered trade agreements with China, with South Korea and with Japan. All of those have meant an increase in what we do in regional areas in particular. For my electorate, what that has meant is we are now the biggest producer of macadamia nuts in this country. Why? It is because the majority of those are exported to markets where we have an advantage under these trade agreements. That was negotiated and delivered by this government. We continue to negotiate on things like IA-CEPA, on the TPP Agreement, which was successful, and on the EU agreement. If we want to build opportunities for people in this country, they need jobs, and those jobs come from trade. We are a trading nation. The more trade we have, the more jobs we have. We must continue to expand our opportunities for our economy, and that is what we as a government are doing. We are absolutely doing it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate Prime Minister Scott Morrison. His announcement last week of a select committee to look at regional development—at what those opportunities are in the future for regional Australia—is a very smart move. It will allow us to deliver a platform which I think we can take to the next election, because we need to grow opportunities in regional Australia. We should stop having people like those opposite talk down the Australian economy. That is what you continue to do in all of your attacks on the Australian economy. It is about confidence. Anyone who has been in business knows—as you know, Deputy Speaker Hogan—that business is about confidence. So I'd say to those opposite again: stop talking down the Australian economy and give every Australian business the opportunity to expand, to grow and to employ more people—and in particular those Australians who live in regional areas, because they absolutely deserve that opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of us in this place know that we have an issue with population shift. We need individuals in regional Australia who are highly skilled, who are qualified, who can do the work that we need. We don't need them all to silo to the cities. So we need to adjust and look at those opportunities. But we know, through the contribution of the member for Kingsford Smith, when he spoke about power—well, once again, I'll make it really clear: that's a state responsibility. In Queensland the price is set entirely by the Queensland government, not by anyone else. They own nearly all of it. They own the generators or 70 per cent of them; they own the transmission. They set the price. There is nothing you can do from this building to change that. That is the outcome. And I say again: stop your attacks. Class warfare does not work for you.</span>

                  </a>  Toughen up, princess! This is, as we've seen, a government without an agenda, led by a Prime Minister who wants us all to believe that he somehow Bradbury-ed his way to becoming the lead muppet of his very own muppet show. This is a government under which we've seen the slowest economic growth since the global financial crisis. Australia is now in the longest per capita recession since 1982. But this government treats it like the first rule of Fight Club.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The national economy has fallen from the eighth fastest growing in the OECD in 2013 to the 20th. Stagnant wages are growing eight times slower than profit. There is rising underemployment and youth unemployment. In my electorate I've got 16 per cent youth unemployment. There is slowing employment growth—five years of weak productivity, weak household spending, falling consumer confidence and weak business conditions, including a sluggish retail sector. Business investment is at its lowest since the 1990s. Living standards are growing slower under the Liberals than they ever were under Labor.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only plan this government seems to have is a plan to deliberately keep wages low. Let's not forget, that's the centrepiece of their economic policy. That's it: keep wages low. Where are the bills pursuing the recommendations of the royal commission? Where are the bills on superannuation, on Newstart, on training and education, on health, on wage theft? Where are they? This is now the second week we've been here, and we've got a Senate that's run out of legislation. We've got a Minister for Families and Social Services who called the pension 'generous'—66 bucks a day. My mum's on the pension, and I can tell you now, that's not generous. She gets by because she's lucky enough to have a family who supports her when she needs to pay that electricity bill or that water bill or that gas bill. But I know there are many pensioners out there who don't have that, and it is an absolute affront to all those Australians who worked hard enough all their lives and are now on a pension for that minister to call it generous. It actually makes me really angry. That's it. That's their agenda: keep wages low, the pension is generous. Oh, and there's one more—how good is homelessness! That's the spin. I can see the ads now, developed by their very own ad man, the Prime Minister: 'How good is homelessness!'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians need leadership. Australians deserve leadership, and they have charged each and every one of us here with providing that—each and every one of us, on both sides of the House, on all sides of the House. Instead, they have a government with no purpose that is either unable or unwilling to bring to this House an agenda that addresses issues—issues of wage stagnation, issues of underemployment, issues of poverty and homelessness, and an economy that under their watch is failing everyday hardworking Australians. This is the government we have. They like to talk a lot about people who have a go. I find it very interesting when this government talks about people who have a go. How about you give them a go? How about you help them have a go? How about, for those who have a go but don't always get a go, you come into this place and you stand here and do something for them? You help them. Because, until then, until we have a government that leads, a government that governs, a government that at least has an agenda, something we can talk about—give us something!—this is not government. This is not governance. And this government will continue to be a government without purpose.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="109556" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  This is possibly the most ironic matter of public importance presented to this House in a very long time—the idea of failing to advance a positive agenda. It's ironic because, six years ago, the Leader of the Opposition ran for the leadership of his party and lost to the member for Maribyrnong. He's had six years to think about the positive agenda he might build for the Australian Labor Party, yet all we have got is the same old Labor. In the Leader of the Opposition's words, they won power. He won power but he doesn't know what to do with it. Nothing has changed in relation to the Labor Party since he became leader. In fact, what we have heard is the same old 1970s-style class war speech from this Leader of the Opposition that we used to get from the former Leader of the Opposition. You'd think that, when seven out of 10 Australians put another party at No. 1 on their voting paper above the Labor Party, it would cause them to think again about their forward agenda. But they haven't. They've got no positive agenda. They've just opposed. This is despite the so-called listening tour that the Leader of the Opposition has taken. He's obviously and clearly not listening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What have they done since we've returned to parliament? They've opposed tax relief. They've opposed the drought fund. They've opposed cleaning up workplaces. Indeed, the member for Cunningham in her contribution demonstrated that there is a level of union militancy denial on the Labor side. They are happy not to have John Setka as part of their club, but they'll turn a blind eye to any standing over and intimidating ordinary working people in workplaces. They took to the election the most negative and economy-destroying policies that we've ever seen—$387 billion in taxes on retirees, small businesses, homeowners, renters, farmers and energy. They had an electric car policy that they couldn't explain, and they had the policy of open borders. Despite the listening tour, we have the same old talking points; it's the same old lines and the same old Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They asked about our positive agenda, and we've got a very big positive agenda, such as the tax reform agenda that we've pursued in the last couple of weeks, where Australians earning up to $126,000 now receive up to $1,080 back in tax relief; small business tax relief, by extending the instant asset write-off to companies with a turnover of up to $50 million and extending that instant asset write-off purchase to $30,000; the plan for job creation, with 1.3 million jobs; the way we are helping our farmers, through the drought relief fund and through the legislation that is currently before this House in relation to outlawing vegan activists who would go onto people's properties and invade them and try and disrupt and destroy one of the great industries in this country. There is our crackdown on the CFMMEU and lawless unions, because we know that ordinary working people going to work should be allowed to go about their business without being stood over, without being intimidated, while just being able to do the job they are paid for. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On home ownership, we have our First Home Loan Deposit Scheme to increase the ability of first home owners to buy a home. In terms of schools, no government in the history of the Commonwealth has put more money into schools. In my own electorate, there is a billion dollars to Berowra schools between now and 2024, whether they are government, independent or Catholic. In health, we're listing medicines on the PBS. There is $308 million for that, to reduce the cost of medicines for ordinary families. Remember: when Labor was in office last time, they stopped listing medicines on the PBS. There will be $31 billion that will go into public hospitals. At Services Australia we are making the interactions that ordinary Australians have with the Commonwealth government easier, and we're using technology to provide easier and better ways for people to engage with the Commonwealth. There is defence, shipbuilding and looking after our veterans, including improving the way in which veterans are dealt with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are key things that are part of our positive agenda. When I think about who in my own electorate is benefitting, it is commuters. People are going to benefit from the $412 million investment in NorthConnex, from the $10 million that will go into planning New Line Road, from $7 million that will go into Hornsby quarry and from the work that we are doing to bolster the oyster industry to give people on the Hawkesbury whose industry collapsed 10 years ago the chance for the first time to try a triploid Pacific oyster in the wild. We have a very positive agenda. It's those opposite who still haven't learnt.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282212" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms THWAITES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  It's important I begin this speech by acknowledging Australia's first peoples. I pay my respects to the Ngunawal and Ngambri peoples, the traditional owners of the land on which we meet. I pay my respects to their elders past, present and emerging. I also acknowledge that the seat of Jagajaga is on the lands of the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an honour to have been elected as the member for Jagajaga. In Melbourne's north-eastern suburbs, Jagajaga is well known as a generous and well-connected community where people's lives are occupied with family, work and involvement in our wonderful schools, playgroups, RSLs and sporting clubs. In Jagajaga we enjoy our open spaces. The iconic Main Yarra Trail winds its way through parklands, wetlands and playing fields where thousands of people walk, ride, play and compete in the sports they love every week of the year. We also hold dear the legacy of the 1956 Olympic Games athletes village in West Heidelberg, which is now home to our Somali community and the many community organisations that work with them and others in the area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I grew up in Jagajaga. My dad was a local lawyer and my mum a local school teacher. Both instilled in me a strong sense of community and a curiosity for what else was out there in places across our country. I was always an avid reader as a child and I learned to interpret the world through stories, so it was perhaps inevitable that I started my working life as a journalist. In this role and in my subsequent work as an adviser and as a public servant, I have been privileged to hear the stories of people from across Australia and to reflect on the power that those of us in this place have to help shape those stories for better or for worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The stories that have helped shape me and driven me to be standing here today are from people who are most dependent on what we do in this place for their livelihoods, their wellbeing and their security. On election night this year, I received an email from a woman in my electorate. I'd met her and her young daughter in a queue at a prepoll station a few days earlier. She emailed me to explain that she was a single mother who had left an abusive relationship and was working hard to try to pay rent so she could continue to live near the excellent public school she sent her daughter to. She asked that I not forget her when I was elected to this place. And I won't, because, as a member of the Labor Party, I will strive to build a community where the stories of people like this woman and her daughter are heard, validated and acted upon. In doing so, we will build a stronger and more resilient community for all of us, including those who otherwise feel like they live on the margins of our society. I believe that progressive politics succeeds when we deliver these people security in their lives and hope for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also believe that the work we do in parliament often seems to be at its most effective when we, the people's elected representatives, move ourselves away from being the centre of the story—when we listen, open ourselves up to conversations and give voice to the people whose stories have not been heard. I saw the power of this firsthand when the Gillard Labor government built the National Disability Insurance Scheme. For many years, people with disability, their families and carers had been trying to tell their stories over and over again, but, to put it bluntly, governments weren't listening. It took a Labor government that was ready to listen and to act to build the scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time, I worked for the former member for Jagajaga, who was the Minister for Disability Reform. I remember the courage and determination of people with disability and their families during this time, but what I remember most was their immense joy and relief when the NDIS was finally established. We haven't yet realised the potential of the NDIS, and making it work must involve an unswerving commitment on our part to listen to and act upon the stories and experiences of those people who rely on it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a personal note, the NDIS changed my life. I met my partner, Daniel, when we were both working at the National Disability Insurance Agency in Geelong, spending many hours together commuting on the train from Melbourne. We are perhaps lucky—and I hope the member for Corangamite forgives me for saying this—that there was not a faster rail link between the two cities then, as Daniel is sure that it was the time we spent together on the train that convinced me he was the one, not that I'm for one minute saying that we shouldn't work towards faster travel times between our major centres!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 2002, my first job outside of Jagajaga was in Bourke, in far western New South Wales, where I worked as a journalist at the local Indigenous community radio station, 2cuzFM. It was an eye-opening experience for a young and naive white girl, as Aboriginal people generously told me their stories while also making fun of my strange choice in footwear. And Birkenstock sandals are still my preferred summer choice! These were the first of many stories I have heard and listened to from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Later in my career, when working for the former member for Jagajaga in her capacity as Minister for Indigenous Affairs, I travelled to many remote communities, listening to the needs and aspirations of our First Australians. It is a privilege to have had this experience and to realise there is so much power in the story of our First Australians, the custodians of the oldest living culture in the world. Unfortunately, it's not a story that many of us grow up hearing. It's not in our lessons and we haven't all had the opportunity to listen and learn directly from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. But the potential is there for us all to appreciate and understand what is the greater, complete national story. Of course, for this to happen we have to be honest about our shared history. We have to walk with and listen to Indigenous Australians, and then we have to act. The parliament has shown it has the capacity to do this, as it did when Kevin Rudd delivered the national apology.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently, the parliament asked Aboriginal people what they wanted for their future, but, sadly, when they answered, the response was muted. The opportunity is still there. We must act on the Uluru Statement from the Heart to establish a voice for truth-telling and for treaty, and we must welcome the voices and stories of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to guide decision-making in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is impossible for me to give this speech without acknowledging the seriousness of the climate emergency and how its impacts are most acutely felt by those people with the smallest buffers in their lives. I remember working in Vanuatu with Oxfam Australia and speaking with a young man there about climate change. He told me how the warming climate was already affecting the amount of food he and his family could grow to keep them all healthy. In fact, his story was powerful enough to shift the views of an older Australian man who happened to be standing near me at the time. I do believe there is a climate story powerful enough to drive the action that allows humanity to survive and to flourish—a story that will allow my daughter and the generations that follow the opportunity to lead safe and healthy lives and enjoy the natural beauty of this wonderful country; a story that sees us doing our part to support that man I met in the Pacific and people like him, with funding for mitigation and adaptation, and an aid budget that is growing rather than shrinking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am confident that Labor's commitment to real action on climate change, with a focus on creating more jobs, more economic opportunities and a better future for us all, will resonate with Australians. And I take hope from the passion and conviction of the young people in Jagajaga and in communities across the country who have spoken out and spoken loudly about the need for climate action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have also heard the conviction of the people and groups in Jagajaga who have spoken out about our need for a humane approach to asylum seekers. I believe this can be achieved while maintaining our sovereignty and our borders. I also want to highlight two issues that have become close to my heart through my working life: the importance of a free and fair press and the value of the ABC. The eight years I worked at the national broadcaster were spent with thoughtful, intelligent colleagues who took seriously their responsibility to tell stories that reflected voices from across our country, to make decision-making understandable and transparent and to hold power to account. This work relies on the ABC being properly funded and being free of political influence. It is absolutely crucial that journalists—all journalists—are able to go about their work without fear of possible retribution or intimidation, sanctioned or otherwise. Our identity as a nation and the freedoms we all depend upon depend on it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And my daughter is not quite making the whole speech, but it's a nice segue because I stand here today as a working mum with a 17-month-old daughter! I'm not the first working mother to be in this chamber and I'm so pleased that I'm not the only one here now. As more and more of us come together in this place, I think we show that it is possible to be both a mother and a parliamentarian. But it's not easy, and this is far from the only workplace where women are still trying to figure out what it looks like to be the mother they want to be and pursue the career they want to have. When my daughter, Harriet, was born, I took nine months maternity leave—some paid, some unpaid. My partner then took three months unpaid leave to care for her. He now works three days a week while I work full time. I realised that our arrangement was unusual, but I didn't realise just how different it was until Daniel starting quoting statistics from Annabel Crabb's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wife Drought</span> to me to prove how much of a unicorn he really is! Only three per cent of Australian families have a part-time working dad and a full-time working mum—three per cent. We can and we must do better than that, because, while this has a host of poor outcomes for women—lost income, missed promotions and a more uncertain retirement—it is also robbing Australian men of the opportunity to reduce their paid work to care for their children and to experience the highs and the lows that come with that. Things have to change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor started making it easier for parents to juggle work and family when we introduced paid parental leave. It has made a huge difference in the lives of many Australians, but there is more work to be done. I am convinced that we need a culture shift in our workplaces so that they are no longer built on the premise that there's a wife at home who is the primary carer. We need to address the bias—conscious or not—that after a baby is born it is women who will work part time before the children start school, who will carry the mental load and who in some cases will leave the work force forever. We need to tell a new story about the important role that men can play as carers at home so that men who want to take that opportunity feel that they can do so without being viewed as a unicorn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need a childcare system that doesn't rely on parents in our cities essentially winning a kind of lottery if they somehow manage to score a place in a centre within half an hour of where they live—one where the value of early education for our children and the value of our early educators are clearly recognised and paid for. I passionately believe that Labor has the track record and the will to make this happen—to build a society where men and women feel fulfilled in our workplaces and in our homes and where our children benefit from this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now to the thankyous. Firstly and mostly, thank you to Daniel for your constant love and unwavering support. I wouldn't be standing here without you. And to my daughter, Harriet, who teaches me about a different form of love every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my parents, Daniel's parents, my brothers, their partners and my nephews and to my wider family of aunts, uncles and cousins: thank you for all the ways you support me. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my mentor and friend Jenny Macklin—I have mentioned the previous member for Jagajaga a number of times already and I think the enormous impact she has had on me is clear—thank you for all you have done for our community, for our country and for being a wonderful guide to me. Jagajaga has actually only been held by two members prior to my election. I would also like to acknowledge and thank the inaugural member for Jagajaga, Peter Staples, as well as the member for what was then Diamond Valley in the Whitlam government, David McKenzie. Our community still benefits from your work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It takes a very large team to win an election, and I want to thank each and every volunteer who stood at prepolls and at train stations early in the morning, made phone calls and doorknocked to get a new Labor member elected. Thank you to my local branch members and campaign team and especially to Antony Kenney, who from the very first days when I couldn't work out how I would get my non-sleeping baby and me out of the house, let alone hold a functioning conversation, got the campaign on track and helped get me elected. He did this all the while being an extremely decent human being.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the organising team, Mitch, Takara, Jude and Emily: thank you. To the state and national Labor campaign teams and my Labor neighbours Andrew Giles, Ged Kearney and Rob Mitchell as well as my state colleagues Vicki Ward, Anthony Carbines, Colin Brooks and Danielle Green: thank you. And thank you to the caucus and our leadership team, Anthony Albanese and Richard Marles, and our leaders during the campaign, Bill Shorten and Tanya Plibersek, for your warm welcome and support. I am so looking forward to working with all of you. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, to the people of Jagajaga, thank you for the opportunity to represent you. I assure you that I am here to make sure your stories are heard and that together we create a fairer and kinder country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="144732" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PAYNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:59</span>):  I want to begin in this place by paying respect to the Ngunawal and Ngambri people and their elders, past present and emerging. The beautiful land covered by the electorate of Canberra and on which our parliament meets is their country. It is a mountainous region with a harsh climate. Living here required great knowledge and skilful custodianship of the land, which the local Indigenous people exercised for tens of thousands of years. When resources were seasonally abundant, such as the bogong moth and yam daisy, there were gatherings of more than a thousand people at a time and important ceremonies were held. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that this land was never ceded and that this institution, our parliament, has often failed to represent the First Nations people of Australia and has inflicted much hurt. Just down the road from here stands the Aboriginal Tent Embassy. Its establishment in 1972 marked a key moment in the Indigenous rights movement, and it remains today a marker of the ongoing fight. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud that this 46th Parliament has made an early commitment to work together towards a voice to parliament and to progress the response to the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Our response to these issues will define how history sees this parliament, and I look forward to participating in this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the greatest honour to represent the people of Canberra in the parliament alongside this Labor caucus. I'm proud to follow in the footsteps of the great Labor women who have represented the seat before me—Ros Kelly, Annette Ellis and the former member Gai Brodtmann, whom I particularly want to honour today. Gai was an exemplary member of parliament. She gave her heart and soul to serving her community over the last nine years. Gai was a fierce advocate for the Australian Public Service and for women. Everywhere we went on the campaign trail, everyone knew Gai and said they were sad to see her leave the parliament. Then they reminded me what big shoes I have to fill. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to thank the member for Fenner, Andrew Leigh, who represented a large proportion of what is now in the electorate of Canberra. Andrew's friendship and support over many years has meant so much to me, and again, I'm aware I have a lot to live up to in representing his former constituents. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Canberra is often dismissed as a 'bubble'—as somehow not being a real city. A boring and sterile place out of touch with the rest of the nation. But those of us who live here know that is not true. The Canberra we know and love is a caring, progressive, multicultural and connected community. Canberrans are passionate about issues of social justice and protecting the environment at the local, national and global levels.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are proud of our city, our nation's capital, that combines immense natural beauty with a unique planned environment designed to complement it. Canberra is home to our national institutions that tell Australia's stories, honour our history and showcase art and culture from around Australia and the world. These institutions bring people to our capital, and it is important we take pride in them as a nation and ensure they are properly resourced. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With five universities and the CSIRO in the electorate, the pursuit of knowledge and breakthrough is a key part of the daily life of Canberra. Canberra's passionate business community work hard to make our city the vibrant place that it is. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a city with high average incomes and low unemployment, which means it can be a particularly difficult place to be poor. Standing up for a strong social safety net is as important for the people of Canberra as it is around the country. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Community organisations work very hard to support Canberrans in need and to make our community inclusive, with creativity and resourcefulness on tight budgets. I saw this first hand as the President of the Belconnen Community Service and as a volunteer at the Early Morning Centre in Civic, serving breakfast to people coming in from the freezing Canberra cold. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Canberra is an environmentally aware community, and we relish our connection to nature. One of my favourite parts of the campaign was engaging with the volunteer groups who work hard to care for our local catchments and bushland. Action on climate change was the issue most raised with me during my campaign. Like most Canberrans, I understand that if we don't take action to protect our environment, all our other aims are redundant. There is no point talking about social justice if we destroy the world we live in; there is no point talking about the economy if it is not sustainable. Protecting the future of our planet matters to me, and to the Labor Party. Our nation must move forward on this issue with urgency.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Canberra is home to the Australian Public Service, which also doesn't always get the respect it deserves. In this town it is our major employer. Most of my father's career was in the Public Service, and I learnt from a young age from his example of hard work and professionalism, including the importance of providing frank and fearless advice to either side of politics. This is vital to our democracy. I saw this same dedication in the people I worked with at Treasury. There is a great pride in serving our nation's government and, through it, its people, and this is part of the character of our city.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">To me, Canberra is home. It is the community where I grew up and have chosen to make my adult life. It's where I attended my local public schools—Urambi Primary, Kambah High and Lake Tuggeranong College—and where I was born and gave birth to our son in the Canberra Hospital. It's where I've played sport and volunteered with local community groups, where I've worked and where I met my husband, Ben.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both sets of my grandparents made Canberra their home in the late 1960s, having moved around Australia extensively before that. For my mother's parents, Joan and Gordon Handsaker, this was because Gordon was a school principal. For my father's parents, Joan and the Reverend Jim Payne, this was because Jim was a church minister. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a proud Canberra tradition, my parents met as first-year students at the ANU. They were brought together by receiving the same comment on their first essay as 'naive and verbose'—undeserved, and certainly not something I've inherited!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The lived example of community service of my grandparents and then my parents—my mother, Patricia, a teacher and then academic in political science and my father, Stephen, a journalist who then made his career in policy in the Public Service—has been an inspiration to me. They taught me from an early age to be aware of the challenges that others may be facing and the importance of contributing to the community we live in, and that your right to vote is precious, as there are people around the world dying for that privilege many of us here in Australia take for granted. My parents also made sure that I knew that as a girl I could do anything that boys could. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to study economics as it seemed to me the study of how the world organises itself—how we distribute income and what levers can be used to affect this. I was privileged to study political economy at Sydney university—a degree that was established by protesting academics and students who wanted the right to study the full breadth of economic thought, recognising that the economy operates in a social and political context and that the dominant neoclassical theory is just that: a dominant theory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Among the protesting students was our leader, Anthony Albanese, and I thank him for what he helped to establish. This was a very formative time for me in shaping my values and solidifying the issues that I have committed to pursuing. These remain key to why I am here today. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I first became politically active on the issue of Australia's treatment of asylum seekers in the Refugee Action Collective at uni. At the time, we were protesting because the detention centres were run by private companies and because people, particularly children, were suffering major mental and physical health impacts while in detention. I never would have imagined that almost 20 years later our nation's treatment of asylum seekers would have actually deteriorated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an international obligation to people exercising their legal right to seek asylum. We have an obligation as human beings to treat people better than this. This issue is deeply important to me, as it is to the people I represent—the people of Canberra who turn up every year in their thousands for the Palm Sunday march in Garema Place and the members of ACT Labor who are tirelessly active on this issue.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For my honours thesis I did a study of policy responses to unemployment in Newcastle following the closure of the BHP steelworks. I interviewed steelworkers, some of whom were fourth generation working at the plant. The loss to them, to their families and to the community was deep—a loss of identity and of planned futures. But Newcastle's experience shows what can be achieved when employers, unions and governments pull together, how a community can be resilient and the difference policy can make.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Sydney I became very involved in my church at Newtown Mission, volunteering in the drop-in centre. At Newtown Mission, the Newtown community came together for friendship, support and hope. People experiencing homelessness, poverty, alcohol and drug addiction, loneliness and isolation, and many who had lost the care of their children came together to share a meal and a conversation. I made many friendships there and was inspired by being part of a community united against poverty and exclusion. People there supported one another in radical ways, committing themselves with a profound dedication to others and to equality. Those experiences cemented my drive to do what I could to fight against poverty and inequality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my work I've pursued finding policy answers to these problems—as a researcher at NATSEM, a public servant and a policy adviser as part of the Labor team. My belief in the power of good policy and the difference it makes in people's lives is what brings me to this place. NATSEM, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, was established at the University of Canberra in 1993 by Professor Ann Harding and has contributed independent analysis that has informed some of our nation's most important policy debates since then—showing how a change to tax or social security policy can have vast impacts on families, households and regions. I was privileged to work with Ann and the other dedicated and brilliant researchers there, including my now husband, Ben Phillips. It showed me the power of numbers to shed light on the impacts of policy and the vital importance of this analysis being independent and publicly available. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe two things have been fundamentally important to alleviating poverty and inequality in Australia, and keeping our economy strong—the right to fair wages and a social security system that is there for us all when we are unable to work. Both of these have characterised the unique Australian system since soon after Federation. In 1904 an industrial arbitration court was established and in 1907 the formative Harvester judgement ruled that workers be paid a 'fair and reasonable' wage for a man to support a wife and children. The decision introduced employee needs into the wage equation. Although limited to a male breadwinner nuclear family model at the time, this was a profound concept. The living wage is something that unions continue the fight for to this day. We have unions to thank for the eight-hour day, weekends, sick leave and safe workplaces, to name a few. I'm proud to have been a union member my whole working life before I was an ALP member.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1908 the age pension was introduced, establishing as a statutory right access to income support for Australians who are unable to work. The universal means tested pension was in contrast to the insurance model being adopted by many other countries at the time. It was based on the income people were able to put away over their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So from the early beginnings of the Australian nation the idea of fair wages and a safety net for those unable to work were enshrined, and they work hand in hand. In 2006 I joined the Labor Party to fight against the Howard government's simultaneous destruction of both these foundations of the Australian social contract. WorkChoices, introduced that year, sought to destroy workers' rights to organise and bargain for fair pay and job security. At the same time the government made the decision to force single parents off the parenting payment and onto the lower Newstart allowance on their child's eighth birthday. NATSEM research showed just how deeply this change would push single parents and their children into poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both these fundamentals of the Australian social fabric continue to be undermined in today's Australia. The Australian Building and Construction Commission treats unionists like criminals, workers have lost their penalty rates, and real wages are stagnating. Our social security system has long failed to provide adequate support to the unemployed, to a point that, for many, dire poverty is impeding their ability to find work. The Newstart allowance is too low. The government should review it and increase it as an urgent priority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today around 739,000 Australian children live in poverty and almost one-third of single-parent families live in poverty. We need to do better for single parents, predominantly mothers, and their children. Single parents do one of the most demanding and important jobs there is—one I have deepened respect for since becoming a mother myself. We should invest in our nation's children and give them the best start in life. Social security is one of the most powerful tools governments have to address and prevent poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In May, we lost one of our most loved Australians, and greatest of Labor reformers, Prime Minister Bob Hawke. Something that was not mentioned much in the celebration of Hawke's achievements was the commitment he made in 1987 that by 1990 no Australian child would live in poverty. While the quote is often ridiculed, what is less talked about is the success of the changes he introduced. Hawke announced a package of measures—including a family supplement linked to wage growth, uniform rent assistance for social security recipients with children, and a new child disability allowance—and, for the first time, used the tax system to collect child support payments from non-custodial parents. These measures immediately cut the number of children living in poverty by a third. By 1994, poverty rates for children of jobless couples had reduced by up to 80 per cent and by 50 per cent for jobless single parents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2009, the Gillard Labor government—and my former boss, Jenny Macklin—lifted one million older Australians out of poverty when they implemented the largest increase to the pension in its history. The social security system is a powerful tool to address poverty. It is about shoes on feet and meals on tables. It is tightly means tested to those who need it most, more so than in any other OECD country. It is a system that we should be proud of. To be proud of our social security system is not to say that it is a preferable option to working; it obviously isn't. It's obvious that a job is the most reliable path to prosperity and inclusion in our society. It's about recognising that each of us, at some point in our lives, may be unable to work—due to health, caring or parenting responsibilities, or an increasingly unstable job market—and that, as a society, we will support each other. Part of the battle is against the disinformation and demonisation of social security and those receiving it. Dispelling these myths is a battle I commit myself to, alongside standing up for a strong social safety net to support us all.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this place we have great power to make changes if we have the will to. I joined the Labor Party 12 years ago because I wanted to do whatever I could to fight for a fairer, brighter future for all Australians. That is the great mission of our party and what I will work for every day that I am in this place. There is a song by Jewel that, to me, expresses so well what it means to be an activist in the fight for social justice, whether it is in grassroots politics, taking the practical action of solidarity in our communities or in this place speaking up for those we represent:</span>

I have had the great privilege to work with three giants of our party: Lindsay Tanner, who showed faith in me at an early stage, which meant so much to my journey here; Bill Shorten, who lead a progressive platform and whose love of, and incredibly hard work for, the Australian people is an inspiration to me; and Jenny Macklin, who I'm thrilled is here today. Jenny has been, and I know will continue to be, a tireless and formidable advocate for social justice. She is a warrior for equality, who has always approached the fight with the facts and the evidence. What she has achieved has driven some of our greatest social reforms.

I have always appreciated his guidance. Thank you, ACT Labor. We are an active and democratic branch, of which I am a product and a champion. I know you'll keep me accountable. To you and Labor volunteers all around the country, thank you for the work you do to share the Labor message and fight the Labor fight. Your generosity of time and energy is not something I will ever take for granted. To Jacob White, thank for being on my team and for the hard work and vision you bring to it.

To Doug and Lainie Phillips: I love being part of your family, and keep up the good fight in Ryan. To my husband, Ben: I love you with all my heart and could not be here without your support, encouragement and counsel. I am inspired by your curious mind and your commitment to getting the truth out there. To my little Paul: you are the greatest joy of my life, and I am thankful for you everyday. Nothing will ever be more important to me than you and your dad. Thank you to my parents, Trish and Steve.

When someone is in need, she will go over and above in every way that she can, because that is what love is, and she will always challenge me to walk further in the shoes of others. It is in this spirit that I undertake this role of service. I feel very deeply the responsibility that I have to work my hardest and to always have an open heart to the people of Canberra and those all around Australia who rely on us in this place to pursue a more inclusive and just Australia. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282306" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PEARCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:26</span>):  Thanks, Mr Deputy Speaker. May I begin by congratulating our Speaker on his re-election. His position is one of honour and he does it justice. Indeed, to everyone in this place, congratulations. We're all here today because of the faith our constituents have placed in us, and I wish everyone right across the chamber all the very best for the 46th Parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the appointment of His Excellency General the Hon. David Hurley AC DSC as our 27th Governor-General of Australia, and I congratulate him. Furthermore, I note the exemplary work of his predecessor, General Sir Peter Cosgrove AK MC. It was during my 20 years service within the Australian Regular Army that I had the privilege of serving under both these distinguished senior officers. I know I'm just one of the many who have benefited from the guidance and the leadership of both generals and that they delivered this to a nation through our Defence Force. In fact, I served under General Cosgrove during Operation INTERFET in East Timor, where my electronic warfare squadron was deployed to the border between Indonesia and East Timor. I have many enduring memories of his leadership, but one stands out. I recall one day General Cosgrove addressing a meeting of senior officers and staff, which ended up with him banging his hand on the table. He said, in desperation, 'I'm sick of you people telling me why I can't do things. I need you to start telling me how I can.' I received that message loud and clear, and I think that's a message that will stand me in good stead as I represent the electorate of Braddon in this role.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I reflect on my service in the Army and I feel many emotions. Above all, I am privileged to have drawn inspiration from many fine leaders. I have had the enormous privilege of serving alongside literally thousands of Australia's most remarkable young men and women. As a sergeant major of my unit, I was responsible for the welfare of the diggers. That was my job. I knew those soldiers like I knew my own family. I knew their partners, I knew their kids and I knew their dreams. I was the keeper of the standards, the enforcer of the military discipline system, the guardian of the customs and traditions of the military. But for me, and most importantly, I was there to represent the soldiers, to stand in front of them, to stick up for them and to protect them, and I can pride myself on doing just that. I've always stuck up for my diggers. The sergeant major of any unit is also responsible for the conduct of our military funerals and for ensuring that our soldiers who pay the supreme sacrifice are given a funeral steeped in the customs and traditions of the ancient ceremony that befits our soldiers' service and their life. And I've seen too many of them. I've seen too many funerals, many as a result of suicide, and what makes this all the more difficult for me is the fact that, rightly or wrongly, you tend to feel responsible. After all, I was the one who was meant to look after them. I still today agonise over the notion that maybe I should have seen it coming. I should have picked up on the signs. I should have stopped this. These are memories and thoughts that I live with every day and that I live with every night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I applaud our government's commitment to the mental health of our veterans and indeed all Australians, and I pledge today, in the presence of my fellow veterans also elected to this place, that I will continue to stick up for the diggers and our veterans. I want to make sure that they are reconnected to a family, to a new job, to a new way of life. I want all business owners and all employers right across the nation to know that employing a veteran is good for your business. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Service means a lot to me. Today I continue to serve, as I represent the good people of Braddon in this place. This is a daunting place, particularly for a beef farmer and small business operator from a small town called Lapoinya, in Tasmania. But what gives me strength and reassurance—what strengthens my resolve today—is the realisation that I don't stand here alone. Standing alongside me today is an electorate of more than a hundred thousand of the best people you'd ever see. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Braddon is an electorate like no other. We are unashamedly honest, we are boisterous in our celebrations, we bind tightly when we feel threatened, we are scathing when we are wronged, and we can spot a phoney before they even speak a word—although down home we've got a different word for that! But, above all, the people of Braddon are caring, and they're generous beyond measure. I've always said that the further you get away from the big capital cities the stronger the sense of community, and none is stronger than mine, my community of Braddon. This community protected me during the devastating loss of my wife to cancer. My little boy and I were nurtured by that community as they gathered around us. I couldn't have done it without them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And they are a wonderful family of farmers. Braddon's farming families are amongst the best in the world at what they do. These are the farmers that got up at four o'clock this morning to milk the cows, who worked through the night to get the crops in the head of the rain. Despite all that Mother Nature throws at them, they still roll their sleeves up and simply get on with it. My patch is home to Australia's largest dairy, milking around 18,200 cows who, together with Tasmania's other dairies, produce almost 11 per cent of our nation's total milk production. Of course, it's not just in the dairy industry that we punch well above our weight. There is our internationally sought-after seafood, like our salmon, our crayfish, our abalone; and, as I speak, families right across the nation are tucking into our veggies—our spuds, carrots, onions, broccoli, peas, beans, cauliflower. And if they aren't then they should be! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our farmers are the best, but they're not boastful and they aren't whingers. These are the quiet achievers. They contribute equally to their local communities and our nation's economy, and they do so without fuss or fanfare. They are the nation's true environmentalists. They care for their land, they care for their animals and they are continually investing in adopting world's best practice. They deal with every challenge before them. But what they shouldn't have to deal with is extremist protesters who invade their farms and endanger their workers and their families and their livelihoods, and I welcome our government's strong stance with the introduction of the Criminal Code Amendment (Agricultural Protection) Bill, which will make it an offence to encourage others to trespass, damage property or commit theft on agricultural land. I look forward to support from both sides as we pass this important legislation through this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate is the town of Burnie. Burnie is home to our Makers' Workshop. It's an interactive cultural hub celebrating Braddon's makers, innovators and artists. It's where you'll find Australia's largest hand paper mill. Right across our region, our makers are busy. They're manufacturing mining equipment at Elphinstone, undertaking defence industry contracts at Direct Edge and Penguin Composites. The Heritage is producing specialty cheeses; and award-winning whisky is made at Hellyers Road Distillery, gin at Southern Wild Distillery, and vodka at Cape Grim on our far north-west coast. We like a drink in Tassie!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Braddon is home to around 9½ thousand small businesses that are driving our local economy forward. As a small business owner myself, I understand the enormous sense of pride associated with waking every morning and being in total control of your own destiny. I also understand the challenges and the risks that this stoic section of our community bears each and every single day. I understand what it's like to borrow too much money to take on that extra employee even though it means going without yourself in order to do so. Look, I get the burden of compliance and the levels of bureaucracy placed upon our small businesses. I'm all about small business: sole traders, partnerships, family trusts—some call them the mum-and-dad businesses. But when mum or dad is taken away from that business to deal with red or green tape, that means half that business has stopped being productive. It's not good enough. We need to give business the room to grow, to expand, to flourish, to employ more people and to create more jobs. This is the right way and this is the Liberal-National way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania's potential as Australia's renewable energy powerhouse is now recognised right across the nation. We have what the rest of the nation really needs—low-cost, reliable, clean energy—and the state is ticking all the boxes towards being 100 per cent self-sufficient in renewable or clean energy by the year 2022. We have plans to deliver that energy to the rest of Australia through our second Bass Strait interconnector, Project Marinus. This will allow Tasmania to expand the amount of renewable energy provided to our national grid and enhance greater investment in other renewable technologies, such as our $250 million Granville Harbour wind development, which is currently under construction on our west coast. Once complete, Granville will deliver one-third of our state's increase in wind power. I thank the Prime Minister and the energy minister, Angus Taylor, for their commitment of $56 million to fast-track Project Marinus, as well as their commitment to work with the Tasmanian government to underwrite the first phase of Tasmania's Battery of the Nation<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Braddon is indeed blessed with many natural wonders, among which is our unique freshwater lakes system. Our first hydro power station was built more than a century ago, and hydroindustrialisation has attracted industry, development and jobs across our region ever since. Today, leveraging off the vision of our forefathers, the federal government is providing $2½ million to support Hydro Tasmania in identifying a suitable Battery of the Nation project site. This represents the single biggest economic opportunity for our state and, importantly for those living on the north and north-west coasts, the three short-listed sites are in our backyard. By the end of next year we should know the final site, and the hope is to progress to being shovel ready by the year 2021. This represents a multimillion-dollar injection into our region, as well as thousands of jobs. The opportunities for Braddon are fantastic, and I look forward to doing my part to drive that project forward on behalf of the people of Braddon, ensuring that the benefits are maximised within the communities right across the length and the breadth of our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Braddon is truly blessed, but I know that not everyone in my region is sharing in the good fortunes of our state. My region has its challenges. We're a rural electorate. We're made up of hundreds of small communities scattered across eight local government regions. We are an ageing population—and I know that! Sadly, there are not enough opportunities in our region for those currently looking for jobs, and our education and health outcomes are not yet what they need to be. There is work to be done, and to this end there are people in my electorate that work hard and tirelessly every day, and I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to every dedicated frontline service provider in my region—our educators, our health personnel, our first responders and our retail staff. They care so much and they do it day in, day out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although there's no simple quick fix to the issue, I firmly believe that having access to the right type of education is important. It's important when you need it most. And I know, because I left school at 15 to become a farmer. It wasn't until many years later that I went back and finished my education. My dream for the people of Braddon—in fact, all Australians—is that, regardless of whether you live in a city or the bush, if you have an aspiration, if you have a dream, then all that's placed in front of you is opportunities. This is true regardless of whether you are 10, 20, 50 or 90. My commitment is to be a loud, strong voice and representative for our region and to ensure that our government fulfils its role in this regard. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to election campaigns, there are always more people to thank than there is time. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge those who have gone before me. I acknowledge my predecessor, Justine Keay, and the contribution she made to this position. To my Liberal colleagues who served as members of Braddon in recent times—and they all got behind me: Brett Whiteley; Mark Baker; Chris Miles, who was a member of the opposition shadow ministry in the late eighties and early nineties and parliamentary secretary to Prime Minister Howard in the late 1990s; and the Hon. Ray Groom AO, a minister in the Fraser government and, subsequently, Premier of Tasmania. Each represented Braddon with distinction. I've got big boots to fill but I'm going to work hard in doing just that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the support I receive also from my military family, especially Jim Molan AO, DSC, Doc Watson and Phillip De Bomford. I thank you for being here today. To our Prime Minister: I have no doubt that I'm here because of your leadership and the genuine interest that both you and Mrs Morrison showed to the wonderful people of Braddon. It was obvious to me from the start that you both cared. I could tell that straightaway. But, more importantly, the people of Braddon could tell that also. You and Mrs Morrison were a perfect fit. They got you and you got them, and so it went. Your interest in Braddon hasn't stopped now that the election has been run and won. It was just a couple of weeks ago that you were back visiting our Psychology CAFFE in Latrobe, listening to the psychologists, watching the parents and their beautiful kids as they sought treatment. Our government has committed to making the mental health of Australians a priority, and you have demonstrated to my electorate that you were good to your word. Down our way, that's important. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise and thank our national director, Andrew Hirst. He was the general of the campaign. I was in awe of his capacities. He's a damn good human, and he's another bloke that just gets it. Thanks to the Tasmanian Senate Team: to Richard Colbeck and his staff for taking me under their wing; to Jonno Duniam, Wendy Askew and Claire Chandler for their camaraderie and support throughout the campaign; and, finally, a special thanks to Senator Eric Abetz. It was you, Eric, who first convinced me to enter politics. Your faith in me and your ongoing support, I will never forget. So thank you. To the member for Bass, and my good mate, Bridget: I look forward to your company during the journey that's ahead of us both, and to working together to do great things for our regions and Tasmania. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my state Liberal colleagues, ably led by Premier Will Hodgman: once again, thank you for your wonderful support; and a special mention to the office of Minister Guy Barnett, Tasmania's Minister for Primary Industries and Water, Minister for Energy and Minister for Veterans' Affairs. He's got a bit on, this bloke, but he's helped me out, no end, over the last few months. To our state president, Geoff Page, state director, Sam McQuestin, and his team at CHQ: thank you. To former state president Ian Chalk and his lovely wife, Jenny: thanks for being here today. I greatly valued your wise council, and I respect you more than I have words.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Leon Perry, Felix Ellis, Rod Bramich, Tony 'Toenails' Hine, Julie Thompson, Pat Darbyshire, Gary, Geoff and Nelson and all the rest of the cast and crew who turned up in the rain, hail and shine—they put themselves out; they worked tirelessly—we did it together, and I can't thank you enough. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Megan's mum, Betty: you won't be getting any more mother-in-law jokes out of me. You were awesome during the campaign, and I thank you so much. To my own mother, Beth: thanks, Mum. You've always been there for us. Your advice is always grounded, carefully thought out and given with love, and I'm pleased that you are here today. To my sister Lynette, who unfortunately can't be here: I am so proud of you and the tireless contribution that you make to the mental health sector over a lifetime in Tasmania. Thank you to my brothers, David and Phillip. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my fiancee, Megan: thank you. You've been my saviour. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you. I was in a very dark place when we first met, and it takes a very special person to work through that. You are a remarkable person. Back then I didn't realise that you were also the best campaign manager that Australia has! No-one did more on the campaign than you. With no campaign experience, you were unmatched in your drive, your determination, your professionalism. You understand the electorate. Even more dramatic, you understand me! You are a natural. As everyone knows in this place, election campaigns take their toll on your personal life. All our plans were put on hold, but it's now time that we reinstate our plans, Megan. I love you and I can't wait to continue our future together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Hamish, my son: Mate, I love you more than I have words. You and I have been through a lot together. You were just eight when we lost mum, my beautiful Amanda-Jane. I held you then and I stood with you at her funeral, and we've stood together ever since. Mates do that—and we'll always be mates. I'm so very proud of the fine young man that you've become, and I know Mum's up there today looking down on us both. I know she's proud. Hamish, you can be whatever you choose. You're already a leader in your own right. You're bright, you're enthusiastic, you're talented, but, most of all, you're kind, you're compassionate and you care. You understand what it's like to be knocked down but, mate, you understand what it's like to get back up again, and sometimes you need mates to do that, because that's the Australian way. I love you, Hamish. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, there's my little princess Isla. When you were born, you represented a new chapter in our lives. You have the sweetest soul, and I want you to know that, even though Dad seems busy most of the time, you're always in my heart and I'll always make time for you. </span>

As I spend time visiting the hundreds of local communities right across my electorate, listening to the constituents, I want them to know me not as a member who represents a bureaucracy, not as a person who tells them what they can't do, not as a member who puts up roadblocks or makes excuses. I want them to know me as their member who is telling them and showing them that they can achieve great things for themselves and they can achieve great things for their families, their communities and, indeed, the entire electorate of Braddon.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="274506" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHARMA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:55</span>):  Like many who call Australia home, my story starts on the other side of the world. My father was born to an Indian family in the West Indies, the youngest of nine children. His family, of modest background and means, worked hard and saved in order to send him to university in London. He arrived just after the war had ended, becoming the first in his family to receive a formal education. It was in London that he met my mother, an Australian girl from Sydney. Like many of her generation, she had sailed to London in the early 1960s looking for an adventure. They fell in love, married and started a family together. My elder twin sisters, Melanie and Belinda, were born in Trinidad and Tobago. I was born in Canada. Before going any further, I do wish to reassure you, Mr Speaker, and everyone else here that I am absolutely no longer a Canadian citizen!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am honoured to be here representing the electorate of Wentworth, one of the most diverse electorates of any in the country. It's a place of breathtaking beauty and home to many Australian icons, from the lapping waves of Watsons Bay to the roaring surf of Bondi Beach and from the test match crowds at the SCG to the glitz and colour of Oxford Street. Wentworth's wealth is more cultural than material, woven from the waves of migrants—Jews, Greeks, South Africans and Russians—who have found sanctuary and a home there. There is a tolerance that finds further expression in a large and vibrant gay community. I am not native to Wentworth. Indeed, I am not native to Australia. But in the best traditions of many before me, my family and I have made it our home. I wish to thank the people of Wentworth deeply for the trust they have placed in me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My family arrived in Australia in the 1970s and settled in Sydney. A happy childhood was altered abruptly when my mother, Diana, was diagnosed with breast cancer. Mum fought bravely, but she succumbed to cancer when I was 12. These were not easy times for my dad, my sisters and me or for my mum's family, many of whom are here this evening, each of whom lovingly helped with the job of raising me once my mum had departed. I was the beneficiary of a great public education at my local high school. My former principal is here this evening, as are some of my oldest and dearest school friends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I did well enough at school to be offered a place at the University of Cambridge, which I took up with relish. After three years there, I was driven by a sense of service and duty to give back to the country that had given me and my family such opportunities. That brought me back to Australia and into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. My first assignment was with the Australian Defence Force in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea, where we had a peacekeeping force. I was stationed in Bougainville and in Port Moresby for over three years, spending my days in negotiations with militants and separatists and my nights often in a stretcher bed under a mosquito net. Working as part of team Australia, we helped achieve a durable peace to the most bloody conflict that the Pacific had seen since the Second World War. Australia has unique responsibilities towards this part of the world, and I am pleased to see the focus on our near neighbourhood increasing under this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After my time in Papua New Guinea, I worked for Alexander Downer during the Howard government, one of the longest lasting and most productive partnerships of Australian foreign policy. Yes, I'm one of the Alexander Downer alumni, but I think I'm the laggard; the others are all on the front bench! I went on to serve at the Australian Embassy in Washington DC in the post 9/11 era before helping lead the international division in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet during Julia Gillard's time as Prime Minister—a leader whom I still regard fondly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was from here and by a Labor government that I was appointed Australia's Ambassador to Israel. My four years in that role left me with a high degree of admiration and respect for the state of Israel, the Jewish people and all they have achieved under tremendously trying circumstances. It also gave me a deep affection for the Australian Jewish community, which has made an outsized contribution to all spheres of Australian life and to the nation we are today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is one of Australia's great institutional strengths that we have an independent federal Public Service which at its best is creative, a rich source of ideas, blunt in its advice but unswervingly loyal to the government of the day. I learnt from many of Australia's most experienced and formidable public servants during my career, amongst them Dennis Richardson, Nick Warner and Duncan Lewis. I hope the Public Service continues to nurture and support leaders like this, with big intellects and forceful personalities, because we are better as a nation for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many other stories like mine throughout Australia. Many of these are more impressive and dramatic than my own. But my story, and all the other stories out there like it, would, I am quite certain, only be possible in Australia—in my own case, to go from being an immigrant to Australia of Indian background to an ambassador for Australia and now a member of our federal parliament within one generation. Together these stories are what makes our country so great: that everyone is given an opportunity to get ahead; that individuals are judged on their merit and the content of their character; that the possibilities are endless for people who are determined and work hard; that no-one is imprisoned or has their fate preordained by the modest circumstances of their birth or the postcode of their childhood; that, no matter the language you speak at home or the religion in which you are raised, you can achieve great things and be welcomed wholeheartedly as an Australian; and that your gender and your sexual orientation play no part in defining the possibilities of your life. Let us never lose sight of the fact that this is what makes Australia so great a country. We must always strive to do better, but truly we are a land of opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Twenty years spent representing Australia overseas taught me two important lessons: first, that Australia is the best country in the world without question—how good is Australia, I ask you!—and, second, that nations are fragile and we can never afford to take Australia's success for granted. I marvel daily at the sheer audacity that is Australia. We are a small group of people laying claim to a vast and resource-rich continent, with much of our population having arrived only quite recently and from the four corners of the globe. In the historical blink of an eye we have transformed ourselves into a nation which is united, harmonious, prosperous and secure. We are one of the oldest continuous democracies in the world. In our Indigenous Australians we have one of its oldest continuing civilisations. We have one of the world's largest middle classes, which, as Aristotle first noted, is an essential component for the political stability of democracies. Social and income mobility in Australia are high. Yes, we have our imperfections—amongst them, ensuring Australia's original inhabitants are participating fully in the life of the nation—but we are one of this planet's most successful and envied countries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our sheer and uninterrupted success as a nation tends to foster a belief that somehow this is all preordained. You only need to arrive in Australia with the fresh eyes and grateful heart of an immigrant to comprehend that this is not so. Indeed, it is complacency that poses one of the greatest risks to us as a nation. The world beyond Australia is changing rapidly. Not only is global economic and strategic weight shifting but the system which governs the interaction of states—the world order, if you like—is coming under strain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, three pillars have underpinned our security and guaranteed our freedom since our emergence as a modern nation. First, our splendid isolation has given us a large measure of security. As an island nation at one end of the globe, not sitting astride major trading routes, our borders are highly defensible. Whilst the tyranny of distance has been an obstacle to overcome for our economic development, in strategic terms it's been a blessing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, we've enjoyed strategic alliances with the major naval powers of the day, first Great Britain and today the United States. These allies have safeguarded the seas and our major trading routes, allowing us to trade freely and underwriting much of our prosperity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, we've been the beneficiary of a world order which has guaranteed the rights of all nations, not just the powerful. This global order was created under the leadership of the United States and its allies at the end of the Second World War. It remains one of the most enlightened and benign exercises in global leadership by a great power. It feels so much like the furniture that we often forget that the alternative is where, in the words of Thucydides, 'The strong do what they will, and the weak suffer what they must' is the form of order which has governed the interaction between states for much of human history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each of these three pillars is now under some strain or challenge. Australia's remoteness is no longer the security buffer it once was. The dependence of our modern economy and modern society on digital and communications platforms means that foreign actors have many more tools at their disposal to disrupt or attack Australia from afar. The changing nature of statecraft too, with blurred divisions between war and peace, and the growing use of active measures and grey-zone operations, makes an open and free society like Australia especially vulnerable. An adversary no longer needs to be able to physically reach Australia in order to coerce, threaten or influence us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As geopolitical power is redistributed, the relative power of the United States—the margin it enjoys over others—is declining, even if it will remain the dominant global actor for the foreseeable future. In East Asia in particular, we see challenges to US supremacy. Of equal concern is the risk of a diminished US appetite for global leadership. It's a United States that is less willing to underwrite the foundations of the current global system and more inclined to cherrypick it, focusing more narrowly on its own national interests. This is a legitimate choice for the American people and their government to make. It nonetheless changes the outlook for Australia considerably.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the post World War II order is coming under strain. We see this in the South China Sea, where long-standing rights and norms such as freedom of navigation and the features that give rise to territorial waters are being bluntly ignored. We see this in trade, where the idea of rules based trade and an independent umpire to settle trade disputes—the World Trade Organization—is being sidelined. More generally, we see an approach where the relative power of nations dictates the outcome of disputes between them—a Hobbesian order where might is right. Such an order will never serve the interests of a country like ours well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does all this mean for Australia? Our strategic holiday is over. Our neighbourhood is getting tougher. The certainties on which we've depended for decades are no longer so certain. We will need to rely more on ourselves and less on others in safeguarding our freedoms and our independence. This has implications for the share of resources we devote to defence and national security, which will surely need to increase over time; the posture of our defence and diplomatic services, both of which must become more capable and more active in safeguarding our interests; and our ability to rely on global supply chains to meet key needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In our external affairs, we will need to mature into more of an actor and less of an observer. It also has implications for the choices we face as a nation. At times, we may need to pay an economic or political price—a trade opportunity forgone, a market missed, a bumpy period in diplomatic relations—in order to retain our freedom of action as an independent and sovereign nation, or to stand up for values we support, or to uphold key principles in the current global order. We need to be prepared for tough decisions and trade-offs that may lie ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, we are now in our 28th year of continuous economic expansion. Two generations of Australians currently in the workforce, my own included, have not known a recession. This is a remarkable achievement. But for Australia to remain a high-living-standard, high-wage economy with a generous social safety net—what we have all come to expect—then our productivity needs to be high, and we need to be operating at the upper end of the value chain. The rapid advance of technology is changing the nature of wealth creation in advanced economies such as our own. In 1967, the largest US companies by market capitalisation—and the main drivers of US prosperity—were General Motors, Standard Oil, Kodak, AT&amp;T and IBM. Fifty years later, the top ranks of the Dow Jones index are dominated by technology companies: Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon. These companies are about data rather than goods, services rather than products, and spaces rather than places. A quick glance at the ASX20 suggests we're yet to make this transition. We have a lot of good companies which employ technology in their operations; we don't yet have a lot of good technology companies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, we have a highly skilled workforce, we have great research institutions and universities, and we have deep and sophisticated capital markets. We have not yet got the policy settings right, however, to help combine all these elements together, so that we commercialise and scale more Australian ideas in Australia, so that we create an environment which is more supportive of start-ups and disruptive, technology orientated companies. If my time as ambassador to Israel has taught me one thing, it is how valuable a thriving technology sector can be for the dynamism and health of the rest of the economy. This isn't about job losses; it's about capturing the jobs of the future, in areas such as quantum computing, cyber, artificial intelligence, space, clean energy, defence technology and automation. The nature of value creation is changing, and the Australian economy needs to keep up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of equal importance is making the best use of the assets we have, including our workforce. The reality of modern family life is that both partners usually work. Once children come along, the cost and availability of child care, the interaction between the tax and transfer systems, and the norms of workplaces usually force one parent to make a choice. My wife, Rachel, and I have ourselves faced such a choice. One parent, usually the mother, either cuts back their hours, takes a job for which they are overqualified but which offers flexibility, or opts out of the workforce altogether. This is not just a tough reality for those who would like to continue working and pursuing their career; it is also a lost economic opportunity for the country. The rate of female participation in the Australian workforce is 10 percentage points lower than it is for men. Halving this gap between male and female workforce participation would be one of the most impactful and meaningful economic reforms we could pursue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During my time as Australia's ambassador to Israel, I dealt with only one Israeli Prime Minister, but I served four different Australian prime ministers. This level of political instability has not served Australia well. It has eroded public trust in the political class. It has made crafting effective and responsible policies on long-term challenges like climate change more difficult. I hope we have now, through internal party reform, put this behind us. If we are serious about preserving the stability of our political system, however, and encouraging better governance, then four-year parliamentary terms should be our goal. With three-year terms, a federal election is always just around the corner. The steady drip of opinion polls and a relentless media cycle accelerates this. Good policies often do not have the time to yield visible results, and political survival takes precedence. All state parliaments now have four-year terms, as do most benchmark international parliaments. Constitutional change would be required to effect this and I don't underestimate the difficulty in doing this, but, as part of a broader set of constitutional reforms, I believe it is worth considering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wentworth has produced some esteemed parliamentarians, and I do wish to pay tribute to one predecessor in particular: Malcolm Turnbull, who served the community of Wentworth and his nation with passion and distinction and who was kind enough to give me a call earlier today, wishing me well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand here, however, not only as a representative of Wentworth but also as a member of the Liberal Party. Though no political party enjoys a monopoly on wisdom or virtue, I believe that, in our party's support for the rights and aspirations and dignity of individuals; in our view that we should seek to govern for all Australians, and that the country succeeds when we all do well; and, in the priority we place on economic management and national security as the foremost duties of any government, we remain the party most relevant to the demands and needs and aspirations of modern Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No partnership could be more important to me than that I have shared with my wife, Rachel, for almost 15 years. Together we have seen much of the world, brought into being three wonderful daughters—Diana, Estella and Daphne—and shared many an adventure along the way. Hi, girls! We have enough tales of drama, tragedy, comedy and sheer excitement to already fill a book. But my love for her, and indeed our marriage, feels as fresh as that of newlyweds. In addition to being an accomplished practitioner of international law and a wonderful mother, Rachel's claims to Wentworth are, in fact, better than mine. It was one of her ancestors, Owen Cavanaugh, who dragged Captain Phillip's launch ashore at Camp Cove as dark approached on 26 January 1788. She frequently drags us all out to Ebenezer, the family burial place, to pay homage to this lineage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The result in Wentworth was hard fought, with two elections held within the space of seven months. I cannot thank enough the many volunteers who turned up, and those who turned out to support me as a candidate throughout this long campaign—from the Prime Minister to the Treasurer and other senior ministers, federal and state MPs and senators, local party members and the party organisation. We had literally hundreds of volunteers—many politically active for the first time in their life; some from interstate, some even from overseas—involved in this campaign. They gave unstinting support, without qualification. I thank them all from the bottom of my heart. I said to friends and supporters at my campaign launch—well, my second campaign launch!—many of whom are here this evening: 'Let's get it done, Wentworth.' Well, we did get it done, and I promise to work tirelessly to repay the trust the voters of Wentworth have placed in me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must also make a special thanks to the Australian Indian community, who adopted me as one of their own, despite my poor command of Hindi and below-average cricket ability, and who have made such an enriching contribution to our national fabric and national life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am conscious that many of my colleagues here leave this place and go on to become ambassadors. I seem to be undertaking the journey in reverse. Perhaps they know something I don't. Perhaps I know something they don't. Regardless, I hope my transition to parliamentary life is as seamless as theirs to diplomatic life. Thank you.</span>
              </p>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:24</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Migration Amendment (Repairing Medical Transfers) Bill 2019. This bill will simply repeal the medevac legislation, which was passed by the previous parliament mere months ago. I remember this very well, as would the majority of other members who were present.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the medical treatment and transfer of people from PNG and Nauru, I say this plainly: Labor seeks to ensure that sick people get the medical care that they need. My colleagues on this side of chamber have always sought to ensure that the minister maintains the final discretion on medical transfers when it comes to matters of national security, public safety and character. Our objectives certainly have not changed. I fundamentally believe that we as a nation should always act in a humane manner. I fundamentally believe as a doctor that doctors should always act in the most appropriate manner to manage their patients and provide them with the best medical care possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The demonisation of these people and the blatant fear campaign surrounding these transfers is, to me, abhorrent and the lowest form of petty politics. Even the Law Council of Australia has strongly criticised this government for the fundamentally political pointscoring in the way they've managed this bill and others like it. We have seen false claims made by this government and Minister Dutton in relation to medical transfers. We've seen people demonised; we've seen people slandered. However, we know that medevac is necessary and that it is working.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Had the minister and this government had genuine concerns or legitimate proposals for improving the operation of medevac, the minister would have introduced amendments to the legislation. What we have here, however, is a government that is content with lowering the standard of political discourse in this nation, and it's simply intent on repealing this legislation and denying people their basic human rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are only in the second sitting of the 46th Parliament and this coalition government's modus operandi would already suggest that they are intent on behaving in a manner that is consistent with fearmongering and the lowest-common-denominator politics that we saw in the 45th Parliament. The home affairs minister has not sought to amend the medevac legislation. He simply wants to return to the flawed medical transfer system that he originally presided over, a system that did not afford the refugees and asylum seekers in regional processing systems access to adequate and timely medical treatment. Again, I stress, we're only in the second sitting week of this new parliament, and the Prime Minister and Minister Dutton have demonstrated that they seek to continue to play petty politics with this issue rather than behave in the humane manner that Australians expect and the rest of the world expects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government would do well to remember the public discussion around this issue in the lead-up to the medevac legislation passing in February. Australia's offshore processing measures have been criticised by a wide variety of people and a wide variety of well-respected organisations, including the United Nations; Amnesty International; Medecins Sans Frontieres, for which my daughter works; the Australian Council for International Development; the Australian Medical Association, of which I've been a 40-year member; the Royal Australasian College of Physicians; the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons; the Human Rights Commission; Human Rights Watch; the New Zealand government; Papua New Guinea's Supreme Court; Papua New Guinea's Grand Chief, Sir Michael Somare; and multiple member nations of the United Nations. This is disgraceful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Pacific Solution was introduced in 2001, then Prime Minister John Howard received criticism from the Human Rights Watch. They stated: 'The recent legislation seriously contravenes Australia's obligations to non-citizens, refugees and asylum seekers, under international human rights and refugee law. As provided for in article 2 of the ICCPR, the obligation to respect and ensure rights to all persons, including all non-citizens, applies throughout Australia's territory and to all persons subject to Australia's jurisdiction.' This is not changed. They also say, 'We have already urged the US government in similar circumstances to amend the new legislation, at a minimum, to implement it in a manner that fully upholds the fundamental norms of international human rights and refugee law.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further to this, more recently it was stated as illegal by UN officials, including by UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, Agnes Callamard, who warned that Australia 'may intentionally put lives at risk'. Nothing has changed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea ruled in 2016 that restricting the movement of asylum seekers who have committed no crime was unconstitutional. Australia's asylum seeker policies were heavily criticised in 2015 at a session of the UN's leading human rights body in Geneva, at which the US delegate stated:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We encourage Australia to enter humane treatment and respect for the human rights of asylum seekers, including those processed offshore in Papua New Guinea and Nauru.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing has changed. Similar criticisms were heard from many other countries, including Norway, Turkey, Canada, Fiji, France, Germany and Switzerland. These are just some of the damning criticisms that have come on a global scale in relation to the coalition's handling of this situation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My friend Senator Keneally said in the other place on Monday that the offshore processing centres on Manus Island and Nauru have become a sign of the ongoing failures of this government and of its Minister for Home Affairs, with his ability to play petty politics with human lives. These facilities were set up as temporary regional processing centres six years ago. People have been there for over six years. The government and this minister will continue to try and blame Labor, but the reality is they've had six years at the helm and six years to fix the problem. It is under this coalition government that these centres have become places of indefinite detention against any human being's human rights. How did we get there? This is a result of six years of failure and inaction by this coalition government. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Dutton is failing a basic test. He is failing to ensure that sick people get the care and attention that they need and are entitled to that we would feel entitled to ourselves. Unfortunately, it would appear that this is not as a result of incompetence or mismanagement; this is a deliberate act. This minister appears intent on performing cheap political stunts and scoring points off the backs of some of the most vulnerable people in the world. We have a minister of the Crown who consistently manipulates, misrepresents and mischaracterises the truth for petty political gain. He is playing with people's lives—people who cannot defend themselves. This is a disgrace. I do not expect that there will be any change on the minister's part. He will not change; he has demonstrated that. And I think the way he behaves and the way he has tried to manipulate this bill and this legislation is politically disgraceful. It's morally disgraceful. It's inhumane. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Dutton is failing a basic test. I repeat: he is failing to ensure that sick people get the care and attention that they need and are entitled to. They have not been charged with any crime. This is an act—an absolute travesty—that goes against any moral compass and he should be ashamed of it. I don't expect there'll be any evidence of humility or any act of contrition because he's done this, but I think as parliamentarians we should all be ashamed of it. We have a minister of the Crown who consistently manipulates and misrepresents. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no reason that this bill should be repealed. This government is intent on driving a wedge in the Australian electorate, pandering to the fearmongering perpetuated by the hard Right in this nation, rather than acting with integrity. The debate around medevac is a perfect example of this. Minister Dutton has repeatedly made false claims about this legislation, crying wolf every time Labor or experts explained and carefully articulated both the process and the need behind the medevac legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since this legislation was passed and given assent, there has been a grand total of just seven patients who have been transferred to Australia for treatment without the approval of either Minister Dutton or Minister Coleman. The government has approved around 90 transfers, and 20 cases have been referred to the Independent Health Advice Panel. The panel includes some of Australia's finest doctors. Of these 20 cases, the panel ultimately upheld the minister's decision not to transfer individuals on 13 occasions and overturned the minister's decision seven times. It's worth noting the panel's independence and the fact that the panel is made up of doctors chosen by the minister himself. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the government and the doctors specifically appointed by the government who control who is able to come to Australia under the medevac legislation. This is completely indisputable. However, the minister has time and time again cried wolf, seeking to make a political football out of this important legislation and, I repeat, playing politics with innocent people's lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister has even asserted that two doctors from Nimbin could force the government's hand—a deliberate untruth that he is telling the parliament. It speaks volumes about the minister's character and his willingness to further ostracise some of the most vulnerable people.</span>

The men and women who work across our national security agencies do a fantastic job, but their jobs are not made any easier by the minister's actions. At each and every opportunity, this minister, the Prime Minister and the government have sought to spread division. I think it's a great shame.</span>

I'd like to talk about one story that illustrates why. The story is set out in a detailed judgement of the Federal Court of Australia. The facts have not been disputed by the Minister for Home Affairs. It is a desperately sad story, which I tell because it provides context to the bill now before the House. It is because of stories like the one that I am about to tell that we supported the medevac laws and it is why we still support them. There are many other stories like this one.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In January 2014, a mother, her young son, her adult son and her daughter-in-law were transferred to Nauru by the Australian government. The family had attempted to make it to Australia by boat after fleeing persecution in Iran. On 8 May 2018, after more than four years on Nauru, doctors employed by the minister's own department assessed the mother's risk of self-harm as moderate. When asked if she could keep herself safe, the mother told the doctors, 'Of course. I have my sons'. On 15 June 2018, after more than four years in detention, the mother's oldest son committed suicide. His wife, the mother's daughter-in-law, found the body in a tent they shared together. He was only 26 years old. On 26 July 2018, an Australian solicitor wrote to the Minister for Home Affairs on behalf of the mother, her child and her now-widowed daughter-in-law. The solicitor's email told the story of what had happened to the family in the immediate aftermath of the eldest son's suicide. Traumatised after five years spent in detention, and devastated by the death of her son, the mother had attempted suicide by cutting her wrists and strangling herself on 17 July 2018. Two days later, she repeatedly hit herself with rocks until she started to bleed. A short time later the boy, the mother's surviving son, tried to cut himself with a knife. Fortunately he was stopped by security. A few days later, he tried again and was fortunately stopped again. The boy said that he wanted to be with his brother.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the first few days after her husband's death, the daughter-in-law sat on a mattress outside in the heat. The mattress was positioned next to a fence. On the other side of the fence, her husband's body was held in a container. She cried. She hit her chest and her head and stopped eating and drinking. The solicitor told the Minister for Home Affairs that the lives of her clients were clearly at risk. She told the minister that the care they needed was not, and could not be, provided on Nauru. She requested the immediate removal of her clients from Nauru so that they could be provided with urgent medical care in Australia. Neither the minister nor his office ever wrote back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 14 August 2018 the solicitor emailed the minister a second time with detailed mental health assessment reports by psychiatrists from Medecins Sans Frontieres in relation to the mother, the boy and the daughter-in-law. The reports detailed how the mother had declared her life had ended with the loss of her son. The mother had told psychiatrists, 'He was my son, my friend, my heart, my everything.' She also endured terrible guilt, describing herself as a horrible mother for fleeing from Iran with her sons to give them a better life, and now her son was dead, frozen in a refrigerator. She told doctors that she did not believe in God anymore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The psychiatric facilities on Nauru were the same facilities that treated the son who had taken his own life. Psychiatrists on Nauru said that the mother and daughter-in-law needed care from specialised staff who were unrelated to the son's death. This was a matter of life or death. So the care that the mother and the daughter-in-law needed could not be provided on Nauru. Doctors said that the boy needed an inpatient child and adolescent psychiatric facility. There is no inpatient child and adolescent psychiatric facility on Nauru. The care that the boy needed could not be provided on Nauru. Neither the minister nor his office ever wrote back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 29 August 2018, the solicitor wrote to the minister again. The mental health of her clients had further deteriorated. The boy was refusing food. The mother was refusing food. The solicitor repeated her request to the minister. The family required an immediate transfer from the environment that was causing them harm. A lawyer for the minister told the solicitor, 'I have sought instructions.' But, once again, neither the minister nor his office ever wrote back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 13 September 2018 the solicitor sent yet another email to the minister. The health of her clients had deteriorated further. The boy left his room only once a day to go to the toilet. He no longer engaged with anyone except to tell the treating clinicians about how much he missed his brother. The family was receiving the most intense form of care available on Nauru. It was not enough. The email attached new medical reports by new doctors. It's unclear whether the minister, his office or his lawyers even opened the reports, let alone read them, because the email was ignored. Once again, neither the minister nor his office ever wrote back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 19 September 2018, the solicitor wrote to the minister for a fifth and final time. The solicitor repeated the advice of treating clinicians, that her clients required admission to inpatient facilities on an immediate basis, facilities which did not exist on Nauru. She repeated her request for the urgent removal of her clients. For the fifth time, the Minister for Home Affairs ignored her.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At 4.30 pm on 20 September 2018, the solicitor filed an application in the Federal Court of Australia on behalf of her clients. Less than 24 hours later, the Federal Court ordered the immediate transfer of the mother, the boy and the daughter-in-law to a location where they could receive the treatment they needed. It should not take many months, a suicide, multiple suicide attempts, countless medical reports and an application to the Federal Court of Australia, for vulnerable people in Australia's care to receive urgent medical assistance. But, in relation to the mother, her son and her daughter-in-law, the Federal Court said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the applicants had no choice but to commence proceedings seeking the relief they did in light of the fact that the Minister did not respond to a single letter that had been written requesting the urgent transfer of the applicants from Nauru.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The solicitor who wrote to the Minister for Home Affairs five times on her clients' behalf, and who was ignored five times, is not un-Australian. The Federal Court judge who ordered the family's immediate transfer to Australia for urgent medical care is not a hard Left activist judge. The doctors who recommended the family's immediate transfer to Australia over and over again, including the doctors employed by the minister's own department, are not activist doctors.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">   In 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, Australia's now Prime Minister and the now Minister for Home Affairs refused to entertain the idea of allowing the family I have spoken about today, and other families like them, to be resettled in New Zealand under a standing offer negotiated by Julia Gillard in 2013. Had they done so, there would be nobody left in offshore detention today. If the member for Dickson, the Minister for Home Affairs, and his colleagues did their jobs by negotiating other third-country resettlement options, vulnerable people would not have been languishing for six years in indefinite detention and requiring medical transfers. The medevac laws should not be necessary, but this minister and this government make them necessary, and they must not be repealed.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:48</span>):  I must say the member for Isaacs, the shadow Attorney-General, is a hard act to follow. We've heard a lot of debate here in this place—much of it academic and political—but to hear such a harrowing story really, really does put into context just what we're dealing with and just what we're talking about here. There were, to me, some unbelievable facts expounded in that story just now told by the member for Isaacs. The fact that the minister did not respond a single time to any of the letters that were sent to him by the people acting on behalf of this family leads me to believe that these are people that the government has forgotten and wants to continue to forget. This motion that we see before us today, this migration amendment, which the government has termed 'repairing medical transfers' isn't at all about repairing anything. It's not about repairing a single thing. It's about repealing something that works so that they can continue to treat these people as people who they can just forget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to use this time here in parliament to explore some of the more substantive questions around the purpose of this bill and the government's agenda in trying to pass this bill. Quite frankly, I'm looking at this bill and the only purpose I can see is to undo a process that was put in place and that, thus far, has worked very well but that also, as the member for Isaacs just pointed out with the story that he told, was absolutely necessary. So what are we talking about here? What are we talking about with this bill? First of all, we're not talking about thousands of people flooding our shores, pretending to be gravely ill just so they can step foot into an Australian hospital. No, we're not talking about that. We're not talking about so many people rushing to take advantage of such a weakened border security that the government has to spend hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to reopen Christmas Island for a photo opportunity. That's not what we're talking about. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the passing of the medevac bill, the government has approved around 90 transfers, and 20 of those cases have been referred to the Independent Health Advice Panel. Of those 20 cases, the panel upheld the minister's decision not to transfer the individual 13 times and overturned the minister's decision just seven times. There's no hint here at all of thousands of people flooding our shores; no hint here at all of a need to reopen the Christmas Island detention centre; and no hint here at all of Australia being bombarded by people who are trying somehow to pull the wool over our eyes by self-harming. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What are we talking about here? We're not talking about security, because all of those seven patients who were transferred to Australia without ministerial approval, where the Independent Health Advice Panel overturned the minister's decision—remember, there were just seven of them—were not rejected on security grounds. The minister did not reject them on security grounds or on character concerns. I repeat: not rejected by the minister because of security concerns but on medical grounds. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These individuals were only transferred after being assessed by a panel of doctors that the minister himself appointed, including the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer and the Surgeon General of Australian Border Force. That means that every other asylum seeker or refugee that has come to Australia for urgent medical care has been approved by either Minister Dutton or Minister Coleman. So, if we're not talking about thousands of people flooding our shores pretending to be sick and we're not talking about security, perhaps we're talking about two doctors from Nimbin. Perhaps that's what we're talking about. Are we talking about two doctors from Nimbin deciding who comes here? That is yet another false claim by the minister because, at every step of this process outlined in the medevac bill, through every measure of this bill, the government, or government-appointed doctors, control who comes to Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also not talking about repairing medical transfers as this bill suggests, and I believe that this is the biggest misrepresentation and manipulation in this bill that the government is trying to put forward. We are talking about the minister seeking to revert back to a flawed medical transfer system—a medical transfer system that allowed a family to experience such grave medical concerns and not get the medical attention that they are entitled to because they are under our guardianship, a flawed medical system that's failing to provide adequate and timely medical care to refugees and asylum seekers in regional processing centres. Time and time again, Labor has had to explain this process and why it is needed, only to have the minister stand up and make false claims about the legislation—using misrepresentation, using fear, using falsities to construct a straw man argument that, somehow, providing essential medical care to people who are under our guardianship, through a rigorous process of approvals, where the minister has the ability to reject applications on security grounds and where a panel of doctors, appointed by the minister, can make a determination based on medical grounds, presents a security risk. Very simply, it does not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This entire bill is based on misrepresentation, this entire bill is based on falsehoods, this entire bill is based on manipulation, and this entire bill is based on the politics of fear that has, time and time and time again, sought to divide Australia by demonising people. But, worse than demonising, it treats them like the forgotten people; it treats them like they don't matter—not even answering a letter from a lawyer raising grave concerns about the health and the mental health of an entire family who have already fled persecution and have been in detention for six years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that my colleagues have spoken at length about this, and I really, really do hope that the government heed the words that have been spoken here today, in this place, about this bill. I hope that the government listen to the story that was told by the member for Isaacs about this family. I hope that they find it within their hearts to ensure that never happens again, and the way to ensure that never happens again is to leave this bill to do that job, leave this bill to ensure that people like this family get the medical help that they need, because they are under our guardianship, because we have a responsibility to do that and because, before medevac, the system wasn't working.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  I'm going to begin and end my contribution by making the same simple point: the medevac law, passed earlier this year in the 45th Parliament, has allowed desperate and damaged people to receive urgent and necessary medical care on the advice of highly qualified Australian medical professionals appointed by the minister and it does so with due regard to any reasonable security concerns. There isn't a reasonable basis for removing a process that allows the medical evacuation of people who need the urgent medical attention that they're not getting. The member for Isaacs gave a brilliant example earlier of the failures of the system, the failures of the minister and the literally grave consequences that have followed those failures. It's only possible to understand this bill as a kind of narrow-minded tit for tat. The medevac laws were passed against the government's wishes, so they have to be removed. They were passed in defiance of the member for Dickson's kind of all-powerful bleak vision of impending apocalypse, so they have to be removed. They don't sit with his insistence on pretending that only by being oblivious to the care of people in offshore detention and only by conduct that is mean and cruel and confected in its kind of cartoonish toughness is this country kept safe, and that is ridiculous. That's why these laws apparently have to be removed. It's not how we should make policy and laws in this place. It's petty, it's cruel and it will do harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one who turns their mind to what the medevac law has enabled could seriously want to see that process removed. Despite all the hyperventilating about what would occur if the laws were passed, the only thing that has occurred is that seriously unwell asylum seekers have received proper medical care. I'm not surprised that there has hardly been a government member who has spoken in support of the bill whose purpose is to get rid of medical evacuations on the advice of medical professionals. All of us in this place know that there are people in offshore detention who are seriously and acutely unwell. They haven't had and don't have access to appropriate medical care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2018 report from the Refugee Council of Australia and Amnesty International noted:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the men sent to PNG are being broken, as their physical and mental health rapidly decline. Some have died. Others have become permanently disabled and one man has become blind. Many are suffering from chronic illnesses.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016, the UNHCR found that 88 per cent of those on Manus Island were suffering from depression, anxiety and/or post-traumatic stress disorder, which were found in 'the highest recorded rates of any surveyed population'. We have to ask ourselves: is it really surprising that men, women and children who are in offshore detention on an indefinite basis are suffering that kind of chronic and severe mental ill health in particular? It shouldn't be. They're people who have fled persecution. They've experienced trauma. Some have experienced physical violence, torture or rape. They have fled war or civil war. They've left their homes and homelands, fearing for their lives and the lives of their families. They've fled with nothing and they've left friends and family behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are circumstances that would be hard for most people in this country to take hold of and really grasp, but they are circumstances that many families in Australia have experienced or are connected to. Indeed, there are people in this place whose families came to Australia in circumstances not all that different. We're a migrant nation. Throughout our modern history we've received refugees and people otherwise fleeing the aftermath of war and conflict.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I honestly can't imagine what it would be like to be in serious fear of my life and at the same time have to accept that there's nowhere I can turn and no protection from local authorities or government or the law; in fact, those things are often the source of the threat. But surely all of us can understand that people who have been through that experience would, if they possibly could, seek asylum from those conditions—fleeing Nazi Germany, fleeing the Khmer Rogue, fleeing the Taliban, fleeing any number of conflicts that have occurred and are occurring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people on Manus and Nauru have been waiting for that asylum for six years and, in some cases, they've been seeking asylum for longer than that. On top of past trauma and persecution, they have suffered, and they continue to suffer, the uncertainty and stress and hopelessness of indefinite detention. They're separated from family. They're detained. They're effectively incarcerated. They desperately want to be resettled, to recover and to get on with their lives, yet it seems that they have less and less hope of that occurring. Their lives have been trauma, dislocation, detention, isolation and hopelessness. Taken all together, that is a recipe for mental ill health, and it's no great surprise it's producing serious mental ill health—illnesses that are as acute and severe as you would want to imagine. People are hurting themselves. Children are hurting themselves. They don't want to be alive anymore in the conditions they experience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In September 2018, there were still 109 children on Nauru. A joint report from the Refugee Council of Australia and the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Children as young as 7 and 12 are experiencing repeated incidents of suicide attempts, dousing themselves in petrol, and becoming catatonic.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, in the aftermath of the Wentworth by-election, the government began moving children and families from Nauru. I think it is a terribly sad comment on how we respond to the clear evidence of harm and the clear prospect of preventable harm that it took a by-election loss for the government to make that happen. But I'm glad that something shifted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Children who have lived most or all of their life in detention are seriously sick. Thankfully, some of them are now getting proper health care. The Independent Health Advice Panel has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is no access to high-quality inpatient psychiatric care in Nauru and patients with severe mental illness and at high risk of suicide should be transferred to a hospital with appropriate inpatient psychiatric care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there were children from Nauru who received inpatient care for acute mental ill health in WA late last year on that basis. There were kids in the new Perth Children's Hospital—a young child and a parent in a locked ward with an Australian Border Force or Serco employee stationed at the door. You're not in that kind of place unless you have been assessed by Australian professionals as being a child whose survival is at risk. I know everyone in this place cares about the wellbeing of children. We all acknowledge the need to do better when it comes to mental health care, especially for Aboriginal kids. And we need to do better for those who are still in offshore detention centres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The medevac bill, passed in the 45th Parliament, passed in this chamber only a few months ago, was one small, necessary, sensible, compassionate, Christian step in that direction. Allowing the men, women and children who are or have been in offshore detention to receive appropriate medical care through a proper process does not in any way affect the security or safety of Australians. That is an enormously serious topic. If you respect that, if you seriously say that the highest priority of leadership and of government is the safety of the Australian people, you should never stand up and trail that about in defence of what is being done here. It is a serious duty. It should not be used by a government or by a minister who simply wants to make himself out to be the toughest, baddest person who ever walked around. There is no courage in that. It is ridiculous, and we see it in here every day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So far there have been 77 transfers, with 19 cases referred to the Independent Health Advice Panel, which was appointed by the government. Of those referred cases, the minister's challenge on health grounds has been upheld on 12 occasions and overturned on seven occasions. The minister has not used his power to deny any transfer on the basis of national security, public safety or character grounds. He has never sought to use that power which he has. In other words, the system is working. People in desperate ill health and on the brink of survival finally have the opportunity, on medical advice, to get the kind of health care that they desperately need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I end as I began: the medevac law passed earlier this year, in the 45th Parliament, allows—and has allowed—desperate and damaged people to receive urgent and necessary medical care on the advice of highly qualified Australian medical professionals appointed by the Minister for Home Affairs, and it does so with due and proper regard to any reasonable security concerns. There is no reasonable basis to change that. When we vote on it shortly I really hope that those opposite hold on to what they are doing, because they are turning their back on a sensible piece of law that has enabled an absolutely desperately needed process for people who are hurting themselves and who are dying because they are so mentally unwell. There's no reasonable basis on which to take away that process. There's no reasonable basis for this bill. The medevac system should not be changed. Thank you.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:09</span>):  I rise to speak against the Migration Amendment (Repairing Medical Transfers) Bill 2019. I speak against it because I'm here to represent moderates who care, and they are tired of this kind of action. I fully agree with what the member for Mayo said earlier. The parliament has already dealt with this issue, and the legislation passed by the parliament in February this year is working. The medevac law was needed in response to the refusal of the government to medically evacuate even critically ill children. The law puts decisions about the medical care of people in the hands of doctors, where it belongs, not politicians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The law is working as intended, enabling critically ill refugees access to the medical and psychiatric care they need while being done at a steady and responsible pace, with no impact on a national security. Ninety-six people have been approved since it was passed—hardly the influx the government claimed at the time. Australia has a responsibility towards the people it has placed on Nauru and Manus Island, the majority of whom have been assessed to be refugees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot wash our hands of these people and hope the problem will go away. The medevac law enables people who Australia has a duty of care for to access a suitable level of medical assessment and treatment not available to them on Nauru and Papua New Guinea. The medevac law does not allow asylum seekers brought to Australia for such treatment to stay here indefinitely. At no time has the government lost control of our borders because of the medevac law. In addition, the law gives the minister the unreviewable power to refuse applications on national security grounds and to refuse anyone convicted of a serious criminal offence. So why is the repeal of a law that is clearly working such a priority for the government? We are talking about just over 600 people remaining in Papua New Guinea and Nauru. We are spending more than $573,000 per person per year on holding people indefinitely offshore, many of whom are very sick.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time for sensible politics. The Australian people want us to spend taxpayer dollars more sensibly. Spending more time on a bill of a limited application out of spite and, I can only assume, wounded pride is not it. It's now quite clear that the other border protection measures that the government has implemented are working. The boats have stopped, and the medevac law has not provided the pull factor that the government claimed it would.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The real question that should be before the House is: what is the government's plan to settle the wretched 600-odd souls languishing in offshore detention for over six years? I call on the Prime Minister to show these poor people the compassion that he talked about a few days ago. Repealing this medevac law is only convincing moderates like me and the many who voted for me in my electorate that he and this government are not understanding and are incapable of separating right from wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Scullin has moved as an amendment that all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the amendment moved by the member for Scullin be agreed to.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="278522" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  Tonight I rise to talk about an issue that is close to my heart, and it is an issue that is very important to many in my electorate. Homelessness is a huge and complex issue that has been talked about in this place for a long time but, as of late, we are not making much progress. In my electorate of Macnamara we have a proud public housing community, from all walks of life and all corners of our globe, many with stories of hardship or heartbreak. I was pleased to spend a lot of time with them, listening and talking with them over the last year or so. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hearing their stories, I was blown away at the resilience and hurdles that many of them have had to overcome. Many of them faced and overcame persecution and mental illness, and, too frequently, their stories feature domestic violence. But it was my experience that those living in public housing in Macnamara have a sincerity and warmth, and I'm proud to represent them in this place. It was also clear to me that each and every person that I spoke to who lives in public housing knew just how important it was to have a safe place and a roof over their head at the end of the day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, after a cold Melburnian day, I was about to get into bed, and it started pouring down. It was a typical cold, wet, July Melbourne night. And I put myself in the perspective of those who were doing it tough that night. It's a pretty confronting thought, but what made it worse was that we recently had the assistant minister for homelessness doing the opposite: instead of thinking of his responsibilities for those who are homeless, in that infamous ABC interview he told us to focus on those who weren't. The minister wanted us to focus on the fact that the more than 116,000 homeless Australians are just a fraction of our population, but that is the highest it has ever been in this country. There are more homeless Australians than ever before. There has been much commentary about his awful turn of phrase about wanting to put a 'positive spin' on homelessness. I hope, if he had his time again, the assistant minister would answer that interview differently, but it does highlight that those opposite don't appreciate what is going on in local communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I was very pleased to welcome the member for Blaxland to my electorate. We met in South Melbourne to visit the Macnamara icon and legend Father Bob Maguire. Many know Bob for his larrikin performances on Triple J and from him causing mischief with his former sidekick and fellow Macnamara local John Safran, but the truth is that Bob spent his entire life helping people in crisis and is still working as hard as ever at 84 years of age.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bob and his team serve thousands of meals every year at different locations and in his community pantry location in South Melbourne, where I was so pleased to join the member for Blaxland, and where I volunteered in 2014 for a number of months, giving food when they were starting up that facility. While the member for Blaxland and I were there, we saw Bob and his team give out a bit of food, a cup of tea and any other essentials that were out of reach. Our Prime Minister likes to talk about the quiet Australians, but the real quiet Australians are the ones who need their government to do more. They're the ones lacking a roof over their heads, they're the ones who take each night as it comes, and they are the ones who need a home and not positive spin.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many policy options the government could take, but one key improvement that really should be done is raising Newstart. In recent months, we've had a debate about the rate of Newstart, which has not increased in real terms for 25 years. Newstart is clearly too low, and I want to be on the record tonight for my support in saying that it needs to be higher. Allowing people to languish in poverty will only make homelessness worse in this country, and there's no positive spin on that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:37</span>):  It's always a pleasure to rise in this place and speak about the wonderful job that our local schools are doing. Our local schools are at the forefront of educating future generations, and it is a pleasure for me to rise today and recognise the outstanding achievements of the students, the teachers, and the P&amp;Cs across my electorate of Forde.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The school community at Parklands Christian College in Park Ridge has been very busy fundraising for their annual Cambodia mission trip. It was an honour for me to support them and attend their recent fundraising dinner. This trip is a rewarding experience for the students and teachers and is a unique opportunity for the senior students to help those less fortunate than themselves. I'm looking forward to seeing them immerse themselves in the local culture and enjoy the humbling experience of being able to serve and care for others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had the opportunity to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of Highland Reserve State School in Upper Coomera at their recent fete. The school community has well and truly grown and flourished since their humble beginnings in 2009 with 150 students. Now, only 10 years later, it has an enrolment of over 900. It was also an opportunity to raise money towards the P&amp;C's efforts to air-condition every classroom. I'm pleased to inform the House that 22 out of 38 classrooms are now air-conditioned and it's hoped more will be installed by the end of the year. I do hope they put in an application for our recently announced school funding program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Kimberley Park State School, students are getting behind Sidnee J's Winter Warmers campaign to provide used blankets and towels and non-perishable pet foods to the Animal Welfare League of Queensland. The greatest part about this winter hart warmer is that the students, teachers and parents got behind Sidnee J and united as a school community to support her project. The unity, compassion and community spirit displayed by the students is a tremendous source of pride and gives me hope for the future. From Parklands Christian College in the west to Highland Reserve State School in the south and to Kimberley Park State School in the north, the schools across Forde are educating and inspiring the next generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Norfolk Village State School in Ormeau, Principal Sam Donovan has well and truly inspired her students by participating in the gruelling Kokoda Challenge. Sam is a member of the 'Being a principal—easier said than run' team, and I commend her and her fellow principals on their achievement. Together they've inspired thousands of students throughout their school communities and raised over $10,000 for the Kokoda Youth Foundation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Students at Windaroo Valley State High School also completed the Kokoda Challenge this year. All participants finished the course, and I'm pleased to report that the team stuck together for the entire event. I'd also like to congratulate Keala Muxlow, Aria-Rose Townshend, Ava Beales and Jackson Lawrence from Edens Landing State School, who were the youngest participants ever to complete the challenge. These brave students finished the course in just under 14 hours and 50 minutes, and I commend them on their achievement. But it is also important to recognise the support offered by their families and teachers, namely Mr Hopkinson and Mrs Alterator, for their leadership and commitment to supporting these champions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd now like to draw to attention the amazing LOTE programs in schools across my electorate. At Waterford West and Eagleby South state schools, students have the opportunity to learn Yugambeh, the local Indigenous Aboriginal language. Jarjum, or children, and their Indigenous languages are helping to close the gap in education, and it encourages our Indigenous students and their families to engage with our schools, resulting in increased attendance and participation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Mount Warren Park and Edens Landing state schools, students can learn Auslan, the language of the Deaf community in Australia. This is a welcome addition to the regular curriculum and in our schools, because teaching Auslan provides benefits for both deaf and hearing students and rightfully acknowledges the place of Auslan and the culture of the Deaf community across Australia. These teachers are helping to bridge the gap, closing the language barriers, by teaching our youth languages other than English. I look forward to continuing to work with the many principals, teachers, parents and students across my electorate of Forde over the coming years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUTLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:42</span>):  Forty-five years ago, on 20 July 1974, the island of Cyprus was invaded by the Turkish military, and over just four weeks and one day the northern reaches of the island were wrested from the Cypriot people. Over 150,000 Greek Cypriots were forced from their homes and displaced into the south of the island. One in three Cypriots found themselves refugees overnight. Over 1,000 Greek Cypriots lost their lives, and to this day over 1,000 people are missing. Their families and their friends do not know where they are or what happened to them. They can't grieve for their deaths, and every year hope of the recovery of their remains fades further. To this day, the island of Cyprus remains divided, partitioned, between the Republic of Cyprus in the south and the Turkish occupation of the north.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Wednesday, I had the privilege of attending the 45th memorial of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus with the Cypriot community of Adelaide and Justice for Cyprus, or PSEKA. For the Cyprus Community of South Australia, led by its president, Professor Andreas Evdokiou, and Justice for Cyprus, led by Chairman Peter Ppiros, this is a cause very close to their hearts. Nearly all the Cypriots who make Adelaide their home either had to flee Cyprus as part of the displaced thousands and make a new life in Australia or have been born to parents who made that terrifying flight. They watched from afar as their homes had been taken and sold to occupiers, and the remaining members of their community in the occupied north live under oppressive and discriminatory rule.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The United Nations and the European Court of Human Rights have both repeatedly affirmed the positions of the Republic of Cyprus and its diaspora—the position that Turkey has committed and continues to commit violations of Cypriot sovereignty and of human rights. The latest rounds of reunification negotiations ended in 2017 due to the insistence of Turkey that they be able to maintain the right to occupy the island with over 40,000 Turkish troops in the event of reunification, scuppering any true hope of a peaceful and united Cyprus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just two days before the memorial event last Wednesday, it was announced that President Erdogan from Turkey will visit Australia in 2020. President Erdogan's visit comes not only after a series of diplomatic difficulties between Turkey and Australia but also in the context of Turkey not only having broken down the reunification talks but also now engaging in drilling for oil and gas in Cypriot waters. This drilling is occurring not only in the waters off the northern coast of Cyprus, which is under Turkish occupation, but also in the waters off the southern coast. In some cases, it is just 35 nautical miles from Cypriot shores.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The European Union has been very clear that Turkey is acting in violation of Cyprus's sovereignty and has imposed sanctions in response to the drilling. The United States has also condemned the drilling. Not only has Turkey ignored these sanctions but, quite shockingly, President Erdogan—in a letter to the Turkish Cypriot leader—wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">No one should doubt that the glorious Turkish military, which does not consider Cyprus any different from its own homeland, will not hesitate, if needed, to once again take the step it took 45 years ago …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the home to some 30,000 Cypriots, Australia has a duty to stand by and represent them. We must, in the strongest terms, condemn the continued occupation of Cyprus as well as the latest incursions into their sovereign maritime territory by Turkey through these drilling operations. We must appeal for lasting peace through the reunification and the demilitarisation of Cyprus, to the benefit of all Cypriots.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of this effort, it is utterly integral that the families of missing people from the 1974 invasion are given the peace that they have been denied for 45 years and the knowledge, finally, of what happened to their loved ones. These matters should be raised in clear terms with the Turkish President by our government during his visit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I sincerely thank the Cyprus community of South Australia, as well as Justice for Cyprus, or PSEKA, for their strong advocacy on behalf of all Cypriots in South Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:46</span>):  I rise today to pay tribute to a number of fantastic people in my electorate of Robertson on the Central Coast who were recognised on the 2019 Queen's Birthday honours list. These locals have come from broad backgrounds and their contributions have helped to shape the Central Coast to be what it is today: the very best region in the very best country in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Denise Lawrence from Macmasters Beach is one such person, recognised for her contribution to music. Since first picking up a cello 70 years ago, Denise has had a distinguished career as a performer, examiner and teacher. At 14, she successfully auditioned to become a member of the Australian Youth Orchestra and a student at the Australian Conservatorium of Music in Sydney. After building her career as a soloist and orchestral player in the UK, Denise returned to Australia and pioneered the concept of teaching instruments in group settings with her late husband, Bruce. This is something that has been continued in almost every school around the country today. It's wonderful to see Denise's contribution to musical education acknowledged with a Queen's Birthday honour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another worthy recipient from my electorate is Dr Michael Scobie. Dr Scobie is a renowned ophthalmologist, having work for years to restore sight to people in Far North Queensland and Papua New Guinea. He began volunteering in 1988 in the North Queensland Aboriginal Eye Care program, where he worked for five years returning sight to Indigenous Australians. In 1996, he set up Central Coast Eyecare in Gosford. At this time, Dr Scobie began travelling to Papua New Guinea, which he continued to do regularly for 17 years. His work has changed the lives of thousands of people, and I commend him on his contributions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Patsy Edwards, another recipient of a Queen's Birthday honour, has served the veterans' community of the Central Coast for almost two decades. I have had the very great pleasure of knowing Patsy for a number of years now. As an active member of the Defence Force for the past 42 years—and I note that she is still on the stand-by Army Reserve list—Patsy is a most deserving recipient of this award. As the daughter of a returned serviceman, she has always been passionate about the welfare of veterans and their families. Patsy took her passion and became one of the first female members of Legacy in Hobart. In 2000, Patsy became a member of the Gosford RSL sub-branch, going on to serve as secretary of the sub-branch for the last 18 years. She has volunteered countless hours of her time organising services on Anzac Day and Remembrance Day, as well as a number of other commemorative services across my electorate. It really is an award that is well-deserved by a person who has made an enormous contribution to our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge our Chris Holstein for his tireless service to the Central Coast. Chris received an OAM for his services to local government in the community of Gosford. I've known him for many years. He's been serving the Central Coast for many years, beginning as a councillor in 1991. In 2011, he became the state member for Gosford and served until 2015. His contribution to public life was not yet over, and he returned to the Central Coast Council and serves as the deputy mayor to this day. He has continually fought to make the Central Coast the great region that it is today, and there are a number of projects and a number of important community groups on the Central Coast that owe Chris Holstein a great debt of thanks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Brenda Booth has also been acknowledged for her contributions to stroke advocacy and stroke survivors. Aged just 41, she suffered from a stroke. After her experience, she has passionately worked to improve stroke care as a member of the Stroke Foundation's Consumer Council, as well as the foundation's Research Advisory Committee as a sole stroke survivor. Locally in my electorate, Brenda is the co-president of the Working Aged Group Stroke, or WAGS, on the Central Coast. Her commitment to improving care for stroke survivors was recognised last year when she was named the Stroke Foundation's 2018 Volunteer of the Year. I really want to thank Brenda for all of her important work in raising awareness and supporting other stroke survivors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I pay tribute to residents from the northern end of the Central Coast, as their efforts have benefited all of us across our region: Karin McGann for her service to the community through Lions Club Australia; Donald John van Keimpema for service to surf lifesaving; and former Central Coast local Alan Morris, who received an Australia Medal for service to wildlife conservation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are lucky to have so many outstanding individuals on the Central Coast. They truly do reflect the fabric of our community, and I thank them for all they do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="248006" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BUTLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:52</span>):  I rise to talk about the seniors of Griffith. There are close to 9,000 pensioners in the electorate of Griffith, and many have been waiting more than 4½ years for a fair go. The Liberals and Nationals were dragged kicking and screaming by pensioner groups and Labor to agree to adjust deeming rates in line with interest rates. The government's recent move on deeming rates is too little, too late for southsiders. The Reserve Bank has cut interest rates five times since 2015, with the cash rate now at a record low of just one per cent, but the Liberals and Nationals have kept deeming rates at up to three per cent. This means the coalition government has been dipping their hands into the pockets of pensioners not only in Griffith but right across the nation. The Morrison government has been short-changing pensioners to prop up their budget for years. Families in my electorate would be very disappointed to know their grandparents and parents have been means tested on money they haven't actually received, which is likely to have lowered their incomes substantially since 2015. The coalition government has been putting their hands in the pockets of pensioners and has profited massively on the back of decoupling the deeming rates since 2015.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pensioners in my community were absolutely confounded recently when the social services minister, Senator Anne Ruston, went on the radio and said she thinks the pension is a 'generous' amount of money that the Australian taxpayers make available to our older Australians. The pensioners of Griffith have paid their taxes for many years. They've worked hard in our community. A number of them went to war for our nation. Those who were here, of course, during peacetime, made a massive economic contribution to Australia. They have already contributed a lot to our nation and to our local southside communities in the electorate of Griffith. They don't need a lecture from an out-of-touch Morrison government minister about their value or the alleged 'generosity' of their pensions, which they very much deserve. They very much deserve those pensions. This is not an act of generosity on the part of the state but recognition of a long life of contribution. This might not seem like much to a government minister who appears to believe a pension is generous, but the difference that has arisen because of the failure to address the deeming rates issue is a meaningful amount that makes a real difference in the lives of people who live in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government's record on pensioners is appalling, and they keep making things worse. The Morrison government did a deal with the Greens party to change the pension asset test, which meant that the pension was cut for 370,000 pensioners, with 88,000 losing their pension altogether. The government also tried for years to scrap the energy supplement, meaning 1½ million pensioners would've had their payments cut. The government tried to raise the pension age to 70. It also tried to cut pension indexation in its first budget, the 2014 budget, and that would've forced pensioners to live on $80 less within 10 years. It cut $1 billion from pensioner concessions in the 2014 budget. You really have to wonder why this government is constantly trying to undermine the retirement incomes of millions of Australians, including people in my electorate of Griffith.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the ministers and to the backbenchers from the government that they need to get out of their offices and into the community to talk to pensioners who are doing it tough. This government simply doesn't get that the stagnation of incomes for pensioners, as well as the wages for workers and indeed the payments for the many, many people over 55 who are on Newstart—something like one in four people on Newstart are over 55—is having real and negative consequences for the economy and therefore for the wellbeing of the Australian people. The government needs to increase Newstart to deliver relief from poverty, to help people get into work, to provide effective economic stimulus and to boost jobs. It's patently obvious to everyone—except perhaps the Prime Minister and the Treasurer—that the rate of Newstart is too low. It's so low that it's actually preventing people from finding work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The policies of this government are resulting in less spending in the community—and therefore less consumption—less small business activity and more financial hardship for communities across the nation. So I say to the government that they need to stop pretending they're on the side of pensioners while attempting to prop up the budget on the back of pensioners' hard-earned nest eggs. It is time for the government to take a serious approach to incomes in this country. Whether it's for aged pensioners, people earning wages or people on Newstart, incomes are really important to the economic future of this country, and the government must take action. If it doesn't then the entire economy and all Australians will suffer.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:57</span>):  All of us are here in this place because of a group of extraordinary volunteers who give up their time and give their labour for free. Chief among the volunteers in Berowra has been my conference president, Matthew Cross. Matt Cross is an extraordinary Liberal who has served our conference for 18 years and has been the president of the conference for the last three years. Matt turned up at his first Liberal Party meeting as a schoolboy in his St Leo's school uniform, aged 16, just before the 2001 election. He was motivated to help out then, and he has helped in every campaign in Berowra since, and in countless campaigns across the state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Matt has held various office positions in our conference, including as vice-president. He was president of the Northcott, now Hornsby Berowra, Young Liberals. He was secretary of the Hornsby state electorate conference. He's been secretary of the Normanhurst branch. Matt has worked for Liberals as well. He worked for my predecessor, Philip Ruddock, and then he went to work for both of the first two state premiers in the current Liberal government in New South Wales—firstly with Barry O'Farrell in the dark days of opposition and then with Mike Baird in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Matt's contribution to our party across New South Wales has been extraordinary. Recently, Matt returned to Australia after a period of time at Harvard University, where he completed his masters degree. He brought back with him a great presence in his life: his wonderful fiancee, Gess. Matt and Gess have decided to make their home in another part of Sydney and, as a result, at the recent Berowra FEC meeting, Matt chose to step down as conference president and move to another area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the Berowra FEC are very grateful—and I am particularly grateful—for all of the efforts and work that Matt has put into our party. I hope that at some point in time in the future Matt will join me and others here or serve in one of our state parliamentary offices. As a person of great principle, a person committed to Liberal values, a person who, through his own efforts and his loyalty to our cause over many years, has demonstrated that he believes that the Liberal way is the best way for New South Wales and for Australia, he will make a great contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm delighted to stand in the House tonight and salute the work of an extraordinary Liberal, a great friend and the best conference president a new member of parliament could want, Matt Cross. Matt, I wish you and your fiancee, Gess, many years of happiness and success, both in your political career and in your professional career. I am so grateful for your kindness, your friendship and all the things that you've done for me. It's wonderful to have a moment to pay tribute to you tonight.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SNOWDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  Last week, we said goodbye in the Northern Territory to Mr Jack Long, who died at the Royal Darwin Hospital on 9 July, aged 84. Jack was born under a tree near Ti Tree in Anmatjere country in 1937 and was part of the stolen generation. At the age of three, Mr Long was taken from his parents by welfare officers and transported to Alice Springs and then to Darwin. He was forcibly removed from his family and, after travelling on a truck, a train and a lugger boat, where he saw the ocean for the first time, he was placed in a Catholic mission on Melville Island in 1941.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While he was born in Anmatjere country, he became a saltwater man who spoke Tiwi and passed on the language and all his hunting and cultural skills to his children. Refining hunting and gathering skills came naturally to Jack through his early years and was to last throughout his life. Suitably and appropriately, his final job was as a ranger. He had previously worked his whole life driving trucks, on pearl luggers, shooting crocodiles from canoes and in other roles, but his favourite job was his final role as a sea ranger on the Tiwi Islands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But his proudest achievement, without doubt, was his family. Mr Long married his wife, Agnes, in 1959, and they had nine children. The sons were Steven, Brian, Michael, Noel, Christopher, Patrick and John, and the two daughters were Kathy and Susie. Mr Long's children and their families and extended families were his life. He was a renowned sportsman and a member of St Mary's Football Club. He played in nine grand finals. He played over 200 games and won grand finals in 1965, 1966 and 1972. Mr Long was able to proudly see his son Michael lead the Long Walk to Canberra to confront John Howard about the condition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country. He was immensely proud of his family. All seven of his sons followed in their father's footsteps and played for St Mary's, and of course Michael went on to play 190 games for the Essendon Bombers. Retired Hawthorn champion Cyril Rioli is one of three of Mr Long's grandsons to play in the AFL. He played 189 games for Hawthorn, and Ben Long and Jake Long are currently with St Kilda and Essendon. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Long was a wonderful man. He had a huge personality, was a great patriarch and was the epitome of what it was to be a Territorian and what it is to be one in this century. He was a wonderful person and a very good friend.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  Over the last few years I have been in many discussions with community groups in Tea Gardens, Hawks Nest and Karuah about a number of important local projects. The upgrade of Lionel Morten Park in Karuah—the home of the mighty Karuah Roos—has been on the agenda for some time, and the council had developed a plan for a $1.2 million upgrade of its facilities. Recently, I was very pleased to attend and announce that the federal coalition government was contributing $496,214 towards the exact project that I just outlined. That's part of our $30 million community sport infrastructure program. It will replace the existing clubhouse amenities, and a multipurpose sports amenity building will come in its place. That will allow for a food and drink kiosk, a referee's room, a first aid room, home and away unisex change rooms, storage areas, formalisation of accessible parking facilities, and public amenities including wheelchair-accessible facilities. It's got an extended awning so you can be undercover. Some days it is a bit wet up on the North Coast, and on other days, when the cricketers are playing, it's great to have the shade. I look forward to attending many more Roos games and maybe even turning up for a cricket match as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Tea Gardens and Hawks Nest, the local progress association and user groups of the Hawks Nest Community Centre have also been agitating for upgrade of the facilities. They are bursting at the seams. The existing community centre was opened in December 1970 and caters for a wide range of community groups, including the University of the Third Age, community health and seniors groups, youth activities and other community functions. Recently I was honoured to announce $300,000 towards the upgrade and expansion of the Booner Street centre, and I'm in discussions with council about their engagement with other groups. This will be a great bonus for Tea Gardens-Hawks Nest, because it is an area with a lot of seniors with a lot of experience. They're all very active, but there is no other venue appropriate for them to expand all these activities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Down the road, at the Tea Gardens Hawks Nest Surf Lifesaving Club, they are doing renovations to their facility. I was really pleased to be able to announce $300,000 out of the Community Development Grants Program to assist in the final stage of the upgrade. Congratulations to all these groups in Tea Gardens-Hawks Nest. As I've said many times, I listen to their concerns, I act and I deliver.</span>

More than a million people are detained simply by virtue of their ethnicity and religion. There are continuing reports of widespread surveillance, restrictions on freedom of movement and other violations of the most basic human rights. Long-term discrimination against the Uygur people in China is an issue that we should all remain gravely concerned about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year a constituent of mine approached my office regarding a number of her family members who had gone missing, believed to have been arbitrarily detained. Today many of them are still being held in so-called re-education camps. I pay tribute to Ms Zulfia Erk for having the fortitude to come forward and explain her story. While the case of Zulfia's family members is deeply depressing, it is certainly not uncommon amongst the Uygur community across Australia. Many Australian citizens and residents face the uncertainty of not knowing whether their relatives have been detained or worse, as they are no longer able to contact them in China. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite widespread condemnation by the international community, China has not shown any sign of slowing its crackdown against the Uygur Muslims. Australia has taken a strong position against the Chinese treatment of the Uygurs, recently joining with 21 other nations at the United Nations Human Rights Council to urge China to end its mass detention of the Uygur population. Yet this move was countered by a statement signed by 30 other nations defending China's Xinjiang policy. Clearly China has taken advantage of its political and economic might to deflect the international criticisms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today in parliament, Amnesty International will hold briefings on the ongoing violations of human rights and the deterioration of religious freedom for the Uygur population in China. They will be joined by Sadam Abudusalamu and Almas Nizamidin, who will share their personal stories with members of parliament. They have bravely made a public plea for our help to secure the freedom and security of their families. While we will continue to demonstrate our support for the Uygur community and monitor the crisis, Australia, as a member of the UN Human Rights Council, must also continue to call on China to honour its international obligations and to respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of its people, including the freedom of religion for the Uygur people of Xinjiang province in China.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  The provision of quality aged care which is accessible to families is an important priority within my electorate as our population ages. How we care for our elderly is a reflection on our society, and we must ensure that our seniors are treated with the care, respect and dignity that they rightfully deserve. There are many important lessons learnt from the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, and it must be our resolve to never repeat the mistakes of the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the 2016 census revealed that there were 27,752 people aged over 60 years residing in the Moore electorate, representing 19.8 per cent of our population or one in five residents. Over the coming years this ageing demographic will require increased levels of care and assistance with their daily living and accommodation. Many constituents have contacted my office to express their concerns about the shortage of aged-care facilities close to home and the long waiting lists experienced by their elderly parents and family members. To meet this growing need the three levels of government—local, state and federal—must work cooperatively to fund and plan for the construction of new aged-care facilities, ranging from independent living units to more intensive nursing care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local families seek a range of aged-care options to suit the specific needs and requirements of their loved ones. The provision of additional funding to care for our senior citizens in their twilight years is a noble cause and must be a priority for our government. Established aged-care operators such as Amana Living, Brightwater, Meath Care, Bethanie, MercyCare and Southern Cross Care have a local established presence and the opportunity to increase the scale of their operations to meet the growing need for residential aged care. A significant number of additional beds are required each year to keep up with the increased demand, and these places will require ongoing funding to provide the necessary care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Locally there are plans to construct new aged-care facilities on sites in Burns Beach, Currambine, Edgewater and Joondalup. The federal government must ensure that additional places are appropriately funded at these new facilities to meet the ongoing aged-care needs. I have written to the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Senator Colbeck, strongly making the case for additional aged-care funding within the city of Joondalup.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  Since 18 October 2017, I have detailed in federal parliament whistleblower evidence of serious misconduct and criminality at Melbourne's Crown casino and provided this evidence to Victoria's gambling regulator, the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation, as well as to Victoria Police. Everything I have detailed has been backed by witness statements and video evidence. In essence, the evidence exposed domestic violence, money laundering, drug use and trafficking, rigging of poker machines, the supply of so-called picks to allow gamblers to illegally make poker machines run continuously and the issuing of multiple loyalty cards to allow poker machine users to illegally operate multiple machines simultaneously. Crown denied the allegations and, in doing so, misled the community, shareholders and the Australian Stock Exchange.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I return to these matters and can reveal that the VCGLR and Victoria Police have responded so bizarrely to all of these allegations as to raise the very real possibility of corruption. For example, why did the VCGLR take six months to find that Crown had indeed modified poker machines illegally but only order a laughably tiny fine? Alarmingly, why did the VCGLR take 15 months to find that multiple loyalty cards were being issued to individual players but that the practice was not illegal and 17 months to investigate the picks and find that it was indeed an improper practice but impose no punitive measures?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Crucially these delays have pushed the VCGLR's findings to after Crown's five-year licence review even though the findings were material to the review process. The delays also ensured the findings were not made public before the 2018 state election in Victoria, protecting the Premier and the gaming minister from scrutiny over the issue during the campaign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As for Victoria Police, they simply refused to properly investigate the allegations, raising the question: do they seriously believe domestic violence or the selling of drugs should be beyond investigation when they are alleged to have occurred in Crown? No wonder whistleblowers, including one current and one former police officer, refer to Crown as 'the Vatican' because of the attitude among Victorian politicians and the police that Crown is to be treated like an independent city state where the normal laws of the land do not apply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not stand by and allow this apparent corruption to go unchallenged. Today I've written to Victorian's Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission, requesting it to investigate the peculiar power Crown has over the VCGLR and Victoria Police. I seek leave to table my letter to IBAC.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  Today I rise to speak on the Local Schools Community Fund, which is a $30 million initiative of the Morrison government announced in this year's budget. It's designed to assist local schools, students and communities through funding contributions for small-scale projects. Two hundred thousand dollars will be made available to each electorate around the country, and it's open to all schools: public, Catholic and independent. Schools can apply for funding for one project per campus between $1,000 and $20,000, and schools composed of multiple campuses may submit an application for each campus. Applications open tomorrow, 25 July, and I will be writing to all school principals in Canning encouraging them to apply for this great grant. Applications will be open until 30 September and then assessed in consultation with a local advisory committee. Successful applicants will be notified in December, and funds will be provided for projects to commence from then onwards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just another example of the Morrison government's strong commitment to Australian schools and to improving them and making them stronger and better for students into the future. Our guaranteed funding commitment invests an additional $37 billion in education over the next decade, to 2029. This increases average funding per student in Australia by 62 per cent over the decade. We've also committed $660 million to 2020-21 through the Capital Grants Program, which supports the construction of important school infrastructure. A good example of this in Canning is $950,000 in December 2018 towards the construction of the Court Grammar School's performing arts centre. This is a school in the heart of the shire of Serpentine Jarrahdale.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the government understands there are often smaller-scale projects that schools would like to address which often get overlooked and pushed down the priorities of these grants. It might be the small-scale extensions or classroom refurbishments, new computer facilities, playground equipment, library resources or sports facilities. I've certainly come to understand this challenge from school principals throughout my electorate, and that's why I'm so supportive of this grant, and that's why I encourage as many schools as possible in Canning to submit an application for this grant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I commend the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education for this initiative, and I encourage all schools in Canning to apply. I look forward to hearing from them all.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00ATG" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHORTEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  My electorate, the electorate of Maribyrnong, is in the north-western suburbs of Melbourne. It's a fantastic area to live in and raise a family, and I want to thank the people there for choosing me again as their local member. One thing which you're aware of in an electorate like Maribyrnong is that, whilst many people are doing well, not everyone is doing well. It is important that we have community services at the local level which look after people and give them all opportunity. We talk a lot in this place about fairness and opportunity, but not everyone starts from the same point.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I was very pleased when the Moonee Valley City Council had in its long-term capital plan a proposal to invest $42½ million in a community centre, a local hub, which would provide opportunity for people living in the Flemington area to access particular resources. For example, for the families living in public housing, the students would be able to study at the community hub. Many of the people in the southern end of my electorate in public housing don't have backyards or have very small backyards. They have large families. They're crowded, but they're families who want their kids to get ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So a lot of work had been done by the Moonee Valley City Council and the ward councillors in that part of the council area to provide opportunity for the residents of my electorate living in that area. There had been a long-term capital budget plan of $42½ million. There had been extensive community consultation. So you can imagine the surprise and disappointment of residents in that part of the electorate and their ward councillors when some other councillors on the Moonee Valley City Council decided to cut the budget in half, from $42½ million to $20 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This decision will significantly reduce opportunities for people from more disadvantaged backgrounds in Maribyrnong and in the city of Moonee Valley. The case for slashing it hasn't been made. There'll be a public meeting tomorrow night. Councillor Nicole Marshall, Councillor Jim Cusack, Danny Pearson, who is the state the member for Essendon, and others have made me aware of this retrograde decision to cut in half a long-term plan to provide a community hub at Flemington that would have provided sports facilities, study facilities and a place for people to gather safely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the council to reconsider its decision to disadvantage the less well-off in Moonee Valley and the Flemington area. I think the council hope that the residents simply won't complain there and that the decision will be ignored. There's a public meeting tomorrow night. I can't attend as I'm in Canberra, but I just say to those in the majority of the council who've made the decision to disadvantage people in the Flemington area, especially those living in public housing: don't underestimate people merely because they don't have the same opportunities as you. Every family has the right for every child to get the resources that local government can provide.</span>

However, these claims have been totally debunked in a peer-reviewed research paper titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Normalised insurance losses from Australian natural disasters: 1966-2007</span> by researchers from Macquarie University and the University of Colorado in the USA. This was published on 24 April 2019 in the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Environmental Hazards</span>. Firstly, the study noted there is:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">in other words, after we normalise for changes we know to have taken place, no residual signal remains to be explained by changes in the occurrence of extreme weather events, regardless of cause.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">For tropical cyclone, the clear reduction in losses observed over time … consistent with declining numbers of landfalling cyclones observed since the late 1800s on the eastern seaboard south of Cairns.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's be very clear about what's happening. We have people who are saying they want to go back to having CO2 levels like they were in 1966 to stop the type of extreme weather events that we had in 1966! We have to be guided by the science, the data and the peer-reviewed evidence—and they totally debunk any claim that there is an increase in more weather damage in Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:23</span>):  There are around 1,780 veterans who live in my electorate of Lilley on Brisbane's north side. Today, I rise to commemorate one local veteran from the Geebung RSL whose drive to serve the Australian community did not wane after his retirement from the military. His name is Arthur Ronald Burke. Arthur is remembered by his family and friends as a staunch Australian historian with strong family values. Born in Brisbane in 1943 during the Second World War, Arthur went on to join the Citizens Military Forces as a soldier before enlisting with the Australian Army during the Vietnam War.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During his 27 years of service in the Australian Army, Arthur commanded both a battery and a regiment of artillery, managed a major defence project which manufactured an artillery gun and was the senior operations officer to the general commanding the Army's First Division. While serving our country, Arthur also graduated from the British Long Gunnery Staff Course, the United Kingdom's Royal Military College of Science and the Australian Army's Staff College.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Arthur's service to the Australian public extended beyond his remarkable military career. After retiring as Lieutenant Colonel of the Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery, Arthur tirelessly advocated for war widows' pensions with Legacy Australia. Arthur devoted part of his retirement to memorialising Australian history by becoming a member of the Military Historical Society of Australia, an honorary historian for two artillery units and the Queensland member of the Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery's history committee. He was also the honorary president of the Anzac Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland and a member of the Queensland Premier's Advisory Committee for the Commemoration of the Anzac Centenary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Arthur balanced his busy volunteer schedule by spending time with his five grandchildren and trying to maintain a golf handicap that was less than Don Bradman's average. Arthur was recognised for his voluntary work with various historical societies and Anzac Day commemoration endeavours with the Centenary Medal in 2003 and the Medal of the Order of Australia in 2006.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, Arthur passed away on 16 January this year at the age of 75. His passing is a loss not only to his immediate family and friends but also to our northside community. We will remember him.</span>

Ian was a well-loved member of the Mackellar community, being a great advocate for Palm Beach and Pittwater as well as an active member of the Palm Beach and Whale Beach committee.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Starlight Foundation has a mission to let sick kids just be kids by giving them some much needed joy and happiness during often very difficult and challenging times. It is an Australian foundation that has significantly impacted many young families and lives. Ian had been a proud patron of the Starlight Foundation for 29 of its 30 years. Ian was an integral part of the founding board of Starlight and the foundation as a whole. Always the entrepreneur, it was Ian's vision and tenacity which delivered Captain Starlight from Planet Starlight into the Starlight Express rooms for the sick kids and their families—programs still unique in the world today. He was also a Starlight wish-granting volunteer. He never ceased to be inspired by the joy and hope provided by a life-changing Starlight wish. According to Starlight, whenever a decision was to be made, Ian would ask, 'What would be best for the Starlight child?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ian will always be part of Starlight. He's in its DNA. He always sought to be true to Starlight's mission and to brighten the lives of Australia's seriously ill children and their families. Ian went on to be part of the founding board for Livewire, an organisation that supports seriously ill and hospitalised adolescents. For Ian, the need for the children was central to everything. Ian's legacy truly is the thousands of seriously ill children's lives that Starlight brightens every day.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ian is survived by his wife, Susie, his son, Sam, and his five grandchildren. I'm sure they are immeasurably proud of Ian's grand legacy. I will never tire of hearing the remarkable stories of the people of Mackellar, many of whom have had a profound influence on the community. Ian, in his own right, is one of those remarkable people.</span>

It affects us all in ways that are, for some, often too difficult to express and for others too difficult to comprehend. The government and opposition both understand that mental health is a serious issue that demands our attention. One in five Australians suffer from a mental health issue. The royal commission into Victoria's mental health system has shed light on the harrowing reality of the current gaps in our mental health support services. This Monday, 22 July, reporter Melissa Cunningham, from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Age</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> reported on evidence submitted to the royal commission. She wrote:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">About two Victorians are taking their own lives each day, with about half the people who killed themselves seeking help from health services in the six weeks before they died.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">She also reported that 'almost 370 Victorians have died by suicide so far this year, with the number expected to soar to 740 by the end of the year'. The total last year was 600.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Corio has not been an exception to these devastating statistics. The government's own figures show that 15.8 per cent of residents of Greater Geelong are experiencing high or very high levels of psychological distress. I met with Reid Maxwell and Mark James from Mind Works Geelong on 15 July in my Geelong office. Mind Works Geelong have been operating in the Greater Geelong region for over 20 years, providing support to locals who are experiencing mental health uncertainty. But they are experiencing significant increases in their work in services and require more support from this government to keep offering help to those in need of it. Prior to the last election, the Minister for Health announced that a re-elected Morrison government would establish a mental health facility in the Corio electorate. The Prime Minister, in a press release titled, 'Making suicide prevention a national priority', on 8 July said:</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  My home town of Toowoomba is a declared refugee welcome zone. Our schools, health services, churches and various support groups have stepped up to embrace newcomers who, in their own way, bring new experiences and perspectives to our Darling Downs community. Our community has opened its heart to those in need, especially under humanitarian resettlement grounds. But I stress that this is not without its challenges. We have to make sure we have the balance right. Some want fewer; some want more. But ultimately it's up to our community, led by our council, to have oversight of new arrivals so that we do get that balance right. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased, therefore, that the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon. David Coleman, has responded to my request to have a high-level departmental delegation visit our city over recent weeks to meet with support agencies, council, health and education sector representatives and others to make sure that we do in fact have the balance right and that we can plan the way forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been plenty of stories and rumours of late about what is and may not be going on. So it's important to actually get the facts on the table. Late last year, we saw some of our agencies in town unsuccessful in their tenders for the new round of refugee settlement grants. We saw others at the same time increase their funds under this particular program. But the fact is that the humanitarian settlement program is the primary funding source for refugee support and it is demand driven. In other words, it adjusts automatically to the number of people arriving in our city under the refugee status.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are settlement grants; the Adult Migrant English Program, or AMEP; and other grants such as the fostering integration funds that I have been able to secure for the PEACEful Humans group work with Yazidi women and children who have been escaping dire circumstances in their homeland, and the employment preparation efforts of Startup Toowoomba and Canvas Coworking. They are all fixed amounts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need the integration. We certainly need the employment outcomes and the benefits that newcomers bring to our region. I'm pleased that the minister, the department and others have responded to my call to make sure that we have the balance right. We need to fund and support integration in our community. There is no doubt about that. We need to continue to support others in need at the same time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  The Ballarat rail yards, currently operated by Alstom, have been an important part of our community for over a century. At their peak, over 50 years ago, the rail yards employed over 600 people. Since their privatisation in 1999, their workers, currently numbering 70, have built over 100 trains. First the workers at these yards built and serviced steam trains, then diesel, and they are now building, maintaining and upgrading trains for Melbourne's metropolitan rail network. The only constant over this time has been a 50-tonne crane, still in operation today, that was built in 1919. I have in my office a photo from the National Archives of the Ballarat railway workers union at one of their rallies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I met with union representatives and the management at the Ballarat site to discuss the challenges that they are facing. Unlike other state governments, the Andrews government has ensured that trains for Victorians are made by Victorians. That commitment has been critical in securing the future of Alstom in Ballarat, and I commend the Victorian government for that. I understand that there is now an urgent need to do more. Alstom revealed to me, and later to the public, that without any more orders they will be forced to begin to plan for their exit. That would be a devastating impact for families across Ballarat and the wider community. If Alstom withdrew, its industrial capacity would be lost to our region, and once these things are lost it is very difficult to get them back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During previous gaps between contracts, Alstom paid its workforce to carry out work that benefited the community. It is not often that you see a company paying its workers to garden, to paint and to repair community facilities, but that's what Alstom did. Alstom have repeatedly demonstrated that they want to stay in Ballarat and that they see a future for the site.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor was proud to take to the recent election a national rail procurement, maintenance and manufacturing plan to ensure that Australia maintains critical capacity in rail manufacturing. It's important across regional and metropolitan communities. This would break the boom and bust cycle of train manufacturing that has bedevilled employers like Alstom and would help ensure that manufacturing jobs building Australian trains remain in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the Andrews government for their previous orders, for their efforts to protect and grow Victoria's industrial workforce and for their efforts to keep this important employer working. I know that the state MP, Juliana Addison, is working very hard to try and secure their future. Other state governments should join Victoria in building trains locally. It's important that this manufacturer stays in my community, and I very much hope that, with work by our state MP, that will be the case.</span>

Credit for the celebrations goes to the acting principal, Joy Muller; her centenary committee; the P &amp; C; and staff, who include Chantelle Forbes, Tamara Tiffin, Nyssa Stevens, Tamar Cohen, Krishna Lawrence, Priya Beshara, Camilla Warner, Justin Vasterink, David Hausen, Rebecca Tapscott, Uncle Wayne—or Michael Walker—and his sister Aunty Vera.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Special mention to Tony Page, who was the principal of the school between 1981 and 1989; Pauline Houghton, who was a teacher from 1998 to 2003 and is now the principal of Rous Public School; Brian and Maggie Creedy for allowing parking on their land; the Kyogle CWA for catering lunch; and Gateway Fine Foods for catering dinner. Large crowds, including former and current students and staff, their families and the community, shared the opportunity to catch up, with many stories and memories. The students performed musical items showcasing their talents with recorder, ukulele, percussion, drums, singing and marimbas. They also buried a time capsule providing a snapshot of life in 2019. Historical displays were set up in the classrooms, which included photos and videos. The CWA were on hand to cater for a picnic on the grounds. A new centenary book for the school has now been compiled, adding the last 25 years to the book published on the 75th anniversary of the school. Congratulations, Collins Creek Public School.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The countdown is on for St Joseph's Primary School Alstonville's 100-year celebrations. Every year the school holds its annual Big Family Day, which normally caters for to up to 600 people. This year, though, on Friday, 31 August it will be a little different as they will be celebrating the centenary of the school community as well. Thanks to the organisational abilities of the principal, Therese Seymour, and staff members Ros Kingsford, Kasey Miles, Liz Bugden and Emma Thrum, visitors will be able to step back in time and see how the school grew from when it was established in 1919. Each of the classrooms and the school library will be decked out for a particular time period from the 1920s up until now. The students are also currently preparing a time capsule to be buried for future generations. They recently dug up the previous time capsule from the 75th school celebrations in 1994 and found newspapers of the day, uniforms, newsletters and children's works. There was even a letter from 10-year-old Elizabeth McMahon, who was a student in year 4 and is now better known as Libby Spash, a teacher at the school. Saturday night will see a big dinner where 200 people are expected to attend, including the Bishop of Lismore, Greg Homeming. The weekend will be rounded off on Sunday with a mass to be held at 10 am. Congratulations to the staff, students and parents both past and present who have made the school the wonderful community it is.</span>

It was very much a Calwell family event because our local CSL in Broadmeadows were the main sponsors of this very important launch. It was also great to see teachers from the Good Samaritan Primary School at the launch where the young Mapalo, who suffers from sickle cell, is a student. I thank Agnes Nsofwa, the group's executive director and founder, for all her work in raising awareness about sickle cell disease in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sickle cell disease is a rare disease caused by abnormal protein in red blood. Signs and symptoms of sickle cell disease can vary in terms of manifestation and the age when they first present. It's a real issue and it's becoming a bigger issue in our community. I am very pleased, therefore, that this awareness-raising Australian sickle cell advocacy group has formed. Agnes tells me that daughter Mapalo's personal journey as a sufferer of sickle cell disease has been a very difficult one and a very challenging one for the family. Agnes decided to set this organisation up because she realises that there is very little known around identifying sufferers of sickle cell disease. Agnes, when she did come to see me, said that while there were many people in the community who were sufferers, they didn't have an adequate database that was able to track the number of people in our community that actually suffer from sickle cell disease and that this was affecting the capacity for research.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased that the Royal Children's Hospital has been involved over a long period of time with the thalassaemia A and B research. Now they have focused on sickle cell disease, which is going to be a lot more prominent in our community as our migration patterns from the African continent, as well as from the southern Mediterranean, see a larger number of Australians possibly carrying this gene. Therefore the whole purpose of the organisation and the launch was to raise awareness and help our very highly skilled medical profession find ways to assist people with sickle cell disease.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  As the federal member for Lindsay, I welcome the Morrison government's infrastructure investment in Western Sydney. It will create many thousands of jobs for local people. As someone who commuted for over 10 years for work, I can say that there is nothing I want more for our community than good local jobs. The Western Sydney City Deal will create 200,000 jobs over the next 20 years. This includes the Western Sydney airport and aerotropolis, which will generate jobs in advanced manufacturing, agriculture, and science and technology. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During construction of the Western Sydney International Airport, over 11,300 jobs will be created. Within five years of opening, 28,000 full-time jobs will be created. This will include jobs in construction, transport and logistics, retail, hospitality and professional services which will be right in Western Sydney. We know that people who work at or near an airport often live in the local region. Eighty per cent of people working in the Kingsford Smith airport precinct live within 30 minutes of work. Today, hundreds of thousands of people commute out of Western Sydney daily. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Sydney airport has set employment targets for local workers to make up at least 30 per cent of the workforce during construction and 50 per cent once the airport is operational. This is a great opportunity, particularly for people who live in Lindsay. The airport is already attracting a number of high-skilled industries to the area around the airport. Northrup Grumman, one of the world's leading high-tech defence and aerospace companies, has committed to establishing a presence near the airport and will need workers with highly specialised skills. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The construction of Sydney Science Park, a $5 billion integrated science, research and residential facility in Lindsay, has recently started, and this is another example of the airport's ability to create local jobs and drive our economy in Western Sydney. The Morrison and Berejiklian governments, and local councils, are working together to attract investment in the region—all supporting the aerotropolis to become Western Sydney's advanced manufacturing aerospace, defence industries and commercial hub. The Morrison government is also providing funding for the North-South rail link, which will run from St Mary's in Lindsay to Western Sydney airport and the Badgerys Creek aerotropolis. This means more people will be able to get to the aerotropolis and to jobs within 30 minutes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are investing in local jobs for the people of Lindsay and for the people of Western Sydney, and I will work hard to make sure that local people in my community will be educated on these jobs of the future and will have the opportunity to work there because of the Morrison government's investment.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  A year ago, I became the first member of parliament to receive the Defenders Badge from ABC Friends National. It was presented to me by Sue Pinnock, the ABC Friends South Australia spokesperson, in recognition of my support for our public broadcaster and for my advocacy for restoring the $334 million which has been cut from the ABC since 2014. This included lobbying very hard for the restoration of the $84 million indexation that will occur over the next three years. That's another $84 million cut from the ABC. I wear the Defenders Badge with pride. Everyone in my community that I talk to is certainly a big supporter of the ABC. In fact, more than 70 per cent of Australians tune in to the ABC every week. More than 80 per cent of us consider the ABC to be a trusted source of news. The erosion of ABC funding by successive governments is a source of concern to many. Public funding for the ABC has fallen by nearly 30 per cent in real terms in the last 30 years, and hundreds of ABC jobs have been lost in the pursuit of efficiency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw media reforms in the last parliament. Those reforms went through and what we've seen is a withdrawal of media voices in regional Australia, with the closing of television newsrooms and savage job cuts in regional newspapers. My Centre Alliance colleagues and I did support the reforms, but we negotiated an ACCC inquiry into digital platforms and a $60 million package to deliver the Regional and Small Publishers Jobs and Innovation Package. Round 1 of that package has funded 70 cadetships, 66 journalism scholarships and 29 publisher grants. The ABC has responded to the exodus, committing to $30 million in two years to put on 80 extra regional staff. This is good news for regional Australia and good news for regional South Australia. In light of the government's indexation freeze, you have to question whether the commitment is sustainable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABC broadcasts from 46 regional and periurban areas, and Centre Alliance supports its vision to expand regional services. I believe that a modest $25 million annual funding injection could fund and equip 150 new staff to fill the gaps in regional coverage. Yesterday I met with the ABC Friends National to talk about the challenges confronting our national broadcaster, and indeed they are significant. Centre Alliance backs the ABC. We will always back the ABC and we back regional Australia. We call on the government to properly fund our national broadcaster and to invest in regional services.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  Today the South Australian government has called for expressions of interest to tender for the building of the dual lanes through Port Wakefield and the overpass to the north and the second bridge in Port Augusta. I wish to speak about that today. In March of 2017 the Great Western Bridge, which was built in the twenties across the top of the gulf, was decommissioned for foot traffic. We'd had a new bridge built in the eighties in Port Augusta, but the Port Augusta foot traffic was on the old bridge. It pushed the foot traffic onto the existing Joy Baluch Bridge, on an unprotected walkway a little over a metre wide—two gophers cannot pass on this walkway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I began lobbying at first for a protected walkway on the bridge, but, after looking at the traffic loads and the predicted traffic increases to the north and west in South Australia, then lobbied for a second bridge. In the 2018 budget, after taking Ministers Chester, Fletcher and McCormack to Port Augusta to stand on the bridge, we announced $160 million to duplicate the Joy Baluch Bridge at Port Augusta, which was to be, and is being, matched by $40 million from the state government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You've got to understand Port Augusta. The bulk of the city is on the east, and that's where the emergency services are. Around a third of the city is on the west, and there are no emergency services—no police, no firemen and no ambulance services. From time to time the bridge is cut. The alternative route is around 40 minutes around the top of the gulf, and in wet weather that's closed. So this is a serious issue for the town, with the increasing traffic loads and the danger to pedestrians, bike riders and kids on their way to school. The schools have taken to running special school buses to bring the kids to school in the morning, so they are not walking over the bridge. So this is a great move forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a fair sense of excitement in the town, even though I must accept that, after the announcement, the public is very impatient for work to start: 'You promised us a bridge. Where's the bridge?' Well, it's all happening; it's locked into the budget and the forward estimates. I will be very excited to see some movement on this. I expect the tenders to be closed out and then certainly to see some activity in the new year. It is planned that the bridge will be completed during 2022, as will the Port Wakefield overpass and dual lanes. Both of these areas are bottlenecks; both of them are dangerous. Both of these projects will actually lead into this push to invigorate the regions in Australia and make sure we make the best of the opportunity that God has presented us and bring the best of that to Australia.</span>

With Gabrielle Quigley and Libby Bloxham, Circus WOW organised locally a flash mob dance to Kate Bush's very popular 1970s song 'Wuthering Heights'. The Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever event is held in cities around the world, with people coming together for good purpose to flash mob dance to Kate Bush's song. If any colleagues remember that, it's a fairly free-flowing dance. I was really pleased to go along and support them, because they were raising funds for Supported Accommodation &amp; Homelessness Services Shoalhaven Illawarra, SAHSSI. I did reflect to those present on the day that my dancing coordination skills have not been tested for some period of time, so I didn't hold out any great hope that I'd be a real asset to the performance but I was willing to put my heart into it. I was very pleased to be joined by my state parliamentary colleague Paul Scully, the member for Wollongong. I won't say that I brought him along to make me look better, but we were both there with good intent! We were joined by a much more dance-talented colleague, Councillor Tania Brown from Wollongong City Council, and many other people—members of Circus WOW, friends and so forth—all dressed in red, to do the flash-mob dance and to raise money for the really important work of our local homelessness services.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Illawarra Mercury </span>reported only recently, in May, that the IRT Foundation, Wollongong Homeless Hub and Wollongong City Council had come together to do a study on the numbers of homeless people in our city. My community, like so many communities across our country, really does have an issue with people who are homeless or have unreliable housing. On the night the survey was done, they found more than 60 people sleeping rough. That's obviously pretty dramatic in the winter months. That's a lot of people with nowhere to go except the street. I thank the volunteers from the IRT Foundation and Wollongong Homeless Hub who carried out that survey. It is really important that we all have an understanding of how homelessness is affecting our community. I call on the government, post-election now, to look very closely at the fact that we need to do far more to address homelessness for those most vulnerable people, including many families.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="109556" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  I rise to congratulate Berowra constituent Larissa Takchi, who was crowned the winner of <span style="font-style:italic;">MasterChef Australia</span> last night. Larissa is just 23, making her the youngest winner in <span style="font-style:italic;">MasterChef</span> history. Larissa was well regarded by the judges throughout and capped off the final with a remarkable score of 85/90. Larissa rose to the occasion in a difficult challenge which involved preparing a three-course meal for 20 people. She served roasted bone marrow with onion soubise, and marron with fennel puree and bisque. However, it was her dessert which was the real show stopper: Szechuan pavlova with beetroot and blackberry sorbet—what a combination of flavours!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Larissa was known for pushing herself and pushing boundaries throughout the competition. Alongside studying a business administration degree at Macquarie University, Larissa, a former Mount St Bennies girl, manages her family's restaurant, the Wild Pear Cafe at Dural. Wild Pear is a favourite spot for local residents and a top foodie destination for people across Sydney. Wild Pear supports local farmers by buying their ingredients fresh from small producers around my electorate. Larissa was known on the show for her unique flavour combinations, which reflected her exposure to a range of ingredients and an ingredients-first approach at Wild Pear, as well as for her desserts, which are another strength of the restaurant. Wild Pear is particularly famous for its rosewater milkshake, and its Instagram page will make your mouth water. Wild Pear is consistently busy. I suspect that, with Larissa's win, it will be even busier now. She credited Wild Pear and the busyness there for helping her to cope in the heat of the <span style="font-style:italic;">MasterChef</span> kitchen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Larissa grew up in the Berowra electorate, and her big family was an early influence on her love of food. She drew on her family for inspiration throughout the competition, with her dad's love of meze inspiring her mystery-box-winning dish, the mouth-watering lemon parfait with black olive madeleine and poppy seed cream. Larissa credited her mum's talent as a cook for shaping her love of good food from a very young age. Nonetheless, Larissa's passion and drive are illustrated by the fact that her culinary skill is largely self-taught. She has long dreamed of opening her own paddock-to-plate farm and restaurant in Dural. I share Larissa's belief that people shouldn't have to travel to the city for good-quality food, given the standard of fresh produce in our electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Larissa received $250,000 in prize money, which will now be instrumental in making her restaurant dream a reality for her and her fiance. However, that doesn't mean she is leaving Wild Pear behind. She has been back working hard on the cafe's famous veranda since the show finished a few months ago. Wild Pear exemplifies what is best about my electorate: a family business showcasing local produce, surrounded by natural beauty and serving as a hub for the community. And Larissa represents the best qualities of young people in our community: resourcefulness, commitment and talent. The local community have been cheering Larissa on throughout the competition and we are very proud of what she has achieved. I'm looking forward to seeing what's next for Larissa. Big congratulations from all of us.</span>
