                <span class="HPS-Normal">We in this place have been here when the IPCC reported. I was the climate minister when the IPCC reported. The report we have now receivedâ€”this parliament, the government and countries across the worldâ€”demonstrates the extent to which we have to take urgent action. It is a race. The earth is hotter than it has been for 100,000 years. We are just years away from an average 1.5 degrees of global warmingâ€”a point at which human security, health and livelihoods are imperilled. This is what was reported overnight by the scientists. This is what we are already seeing. For the world and for Australia this is an emergency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has long been predicted. As I predicted on the basis of the advice given to me over a decade ago when we sat on that side, Australia is feeling the brunt of it. Our land areas have already warmed by 1.5 degrees on average, heat extremes have increased, cold extremes have decreased and scientists have a high degree of confidence that these trends will get worse. This is why we ought to debate this motion. We are seeing sea levels rising at higher rates than the global average. We are seeing snow cover and depth decreasing. We have seen fire like we have never seen it before. Extreme fire weather days have become more frequent and the fire season has become longer. What we are told is that the intensity, frequency and duration of fire weather events will increase throughout Australia. Of course, regrettably, as a continent that is one of the most affected on this earth, we will lurch from one extreme to another because destructive heavy rainfall and river floods will also increase. This is the compound effect of years of failure to curb emissions, to curb carbon pollution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those on the other side speak often about what we owe future generations, and I think all of us wonder what our children will say about this parliament. My daughter did an investigation projectâ€”I think that's what they call them these daysâ€”and she chose climate change. Her first question to me was: 'Is there anything we can do?' We have an obligation. For many years we have had this obligation and those opposite have refused to shoulder responsibility. For many years we have been in a race, and the race against climate change is a race we have to win. It is a race towards renewable energy. It is a race in which we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to jump ahead of the pack with renewable energy made by Australian workers with Australian technologyâ€”energy that could be exported to a world that needs it. As we have said so often, this is about the jobs for today and the jobs of the future, because if we invest in renewables we will create thousands of good-paying jobs in growing industries. We could make power cheaper and cleaner, but we have a government that never acts until it's too late. It's a government that misses every opportunity, a government who always says, 'It's not a race; it's not a competition.' Well, this is, and it is the emergency that so many speak of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would make this point: the only way, as has been demonstrated with the election of President Biden, that you will get an Australian nation that is willing to do something about climate is if you change the government. You have to change the government if you want to deal with this. Fine speeches and trying to have a go at everybody is not going to do it. We have to change the government if this country is actually going to do something about the climate emergency that we face. If our Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme had been in place for the decade between 2010 and 2020, we would have emitted 161 million tonnes less into the atmosphere. That is the difference a government that is committed to climate change can make and that is why we have to change the government if we are going to actually ensure this country acts on climate. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  The report last night talks about the devastating impacts of exceeding a 1Â½ degree climate rise. We've got 10 years, and all we see in this chamber is both parties taking massive donations from the coal, oil and gas companies. Yes, here we go again, because we will keep raising this issue until we get science based policies. We will say, until we are blue in the face, that we want to see a different government, but, if you want to get climate action, you need the Greens in the balance of power to push a new government to go further and faster on the climate crisis. If you want action on the climate crisis in the next decadeâ€”which, as last night's report says, is urgentâ€”then you need the Greens in the balance of power, because frankly this debate about 2050 is too little too late.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we see millions of dollars sloshing around in donations from the coal, oil and gas sector, and while we see public money being given to private companies, headed up by Liberal donors, to open up new gas basins against the wishes of a First Nations community in the Northern Territory, you will not see science based climate policy. That is why it is urgent that we suspend standing orders todayâ€”not to talk about net zero by 2050 but to talk about decent climate targets by 2030, so that we have some chance of saving agriculture in this nation and of reducing the severity of awful bushfires like those we saw not two years ago, when the Prime Minister was taking a holiday in Hawaii. We've seen awful fires now hit the birthplace of democracy, Athens, and we've seen flooding in Europe. This is real. It is not something for the future. This is happening now. We've seen saltwater incursion into our Torres Strait Islands food-producing land. This is not something that can be delayed. We need action now, and, if we want to have any chance of staying below 1Â½ degrees, we need rapid and urgent cuts to emissions.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government haven't even read the science; they've never met a scientist, and they're certainly not going to start listening to them now. The flaccid pressure on them by the so-called opposition for a 2050 target, which will be too late, is frankly embarrassing. We need science to be deciding policies in this place, not donations from the coal, oil and gas companies. Until such time as other parties join the Greens in refusing donations from those fossil fuel crony capitalists, then we won't get science based policiesâ€”and, in fact, that's what the Australian populace expect and deserve from us.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a decent carbon price; it was working to bring down emissions. The Greens want to see good climate policy, we want to see a change of government and we want to work with the next government to push them to go harder and faster on the climate crisis, because, at the minute, without the Greens, you won't see urgent action. You will see donors getting their wishes delivered upon, which is not enough. We need a decent opposition, we need a government to listen to science and you need the Greens in the balance of power if we're to have any chance of taking climate action.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a report last night that could not have been clearer in its warning. It is not the first time that we have had a clear warning and report from the world's scientists, but this one is the most urgent and the most pressing yet. I find it a little baffling that we have consternation in the chamber about the fact that 2030 is what we need to be talking about. You have a government whose targets for 2030 are so weak they are essentially one-third of what needs to occur to keep this country safe and to keep us underneath a 1Â½-degree tipping point, beyond which there is no return. Certainly this government's policies have on us on track for four degrees of warming. That's actually catastrophe. That is actually the end of agriculture as we know it. It's dead oceans. It's bushfires of such severity that we cannot even fathom it. It is not an option.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, yes, we need to change the government. Of course we need to change the government. This government is controlled by its climate denialist backbenchers. They can't even bring themselves to meet with the scientists, let alone follow their advice.</span>

                  </a>  I'm being reminded by my erudite colleagues here that it's not just the backbench that have a problem with science in the government; of course, it's many of their frontbenchers as well. So it is absolutely clear that the government of this nation, the Morrison government, are not doing what is necessary to keep Australians safe. They are, in fact, setting us on a trajectory of a death sentence for nature, for society and for our economy. Wrong way; go back. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we cannot tolerate is discussion of 2050 without discussion of what needs to happen in the next 10 years. The report last night could not have been clearer: 2050 is too late. Net zero by 2050 is too late. We can do so much better. We can actually create a jobs boom. We can transition those existing fossil fuel workers into clean jobs that will last and that won't cause them health problems. We can actually tackle this crisis collectively as a nation and give our nation and the world the best shot at a safe future. But we need to be doing that rapidly and urgently by cutting emissions from the coal, oil and gas sector, not by opening up new coal, oil and gas fields and not by dishing out public money to help private companies do thatâ€”certainly not when those private companies are donors to either the Liberal Party or, in many cases, the Labor Party. It is about time we stopped those fossil fuel donors from exerting so much influence over policymaking. We welcome the fact that parliament has spent a short part of todayâ€”we would hope for the whole dayâ€”talking about this issue, but what we cannot stomach is the idea that 2050 is somehow enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to work with the opposition. We want them to be in government, but without the Greens in the balance of power you won't see the strong and urgent action that the scientists are saying is necessary. We had world-leading climate laws. That's what the Greens and Labor delivered under the Gillard prime ministership. It was working. It is the only time emissions have come down in our nation's history. It was world leading and it was axed by this climate-denying government. We want to work with the opposition when they are in government, and we want them to go harder and faster on the climate crisis, because we don't have any time to lose. Warming of 1Â½ degrees is a tipping point that we cannot go above. We know that if we even hit two degrees our global coral reefs will be written off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take umbrage at the quite extensive 'contributions', as I might term them, from the opposition to our suspension motion. We know 2050 is too late. Delay is the new denial. We need this parliament to be talking about 2030 targets. The government's 2030 targets are so weak that they have us on a path which is a death sentence. I'm sick of fossil fuel companies calling the shots on our nation's climate policies. So is the rest of the country. For God's sake, give the money back and start listening to the scientists when drafting climate policy, or you will be consigned to the opposition benches, as I hope you will be, and the Greens will work with the new government to deliver decent climate action.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245759" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  I want to briefly contribute to this debate to flag that Labor will be supporting the motion to suspend standing orders. We will not, however, be voting for the substantive motion, because it doesn't reflect the Labor position.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to take the opportunity to also bring to the chamber's attention the very serious risks that have been outlined in the IPCC report released overnight, particularly for regional Queensland and especially for northern Australia. It is somewhat ironic that in this chamber some of the hardest opponents of taking action on climate change are representatives, so called, of regional Australia. The IPCC report makes very clear that it is regional Australia, more than any other part of the country and almost more than any other part of the world, that faces the most serious risks if action on climate change is not taken. Even in the last couple of years, whether it be the Black Summer fires, whether it be floods or whether it be cyclones, we have seen that, constantly, it's regional Australia that bears the brunt of our changing climate. It's regional Australia that pays the price for this government's lack of action on climate change, and it's regional Australia that is being so profoundly let down by a government that claims to represent it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's before we get to the incredible job opportunities that can exist in regional Australia if we actually start taking action on climate change. We can create jobs in regional Queensland and elsewhere in regional Australia if we take action on climate change. That's probably why every stakeholder, from the National Farmers Federation to Rio Tinto, BHP and gas companies, is backing net zero emissions by 2050. It's not because they're good corporate citizens; it's because they know that there is money to be made and jobs to be created. That's why they're backing it, that's why Labor is backing it, and that's why we need this government to actually start taking some action rather than continuing the approach we always see from them, which is to never take responsibility, to blame others and to come up with spin lines to avoid actually doing anything.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just in closing, though, I do want to respond to a couple of the points that Senator Waters has made on behalf of the Greens. In fact, I predicted, as we walked into this chamber, that most of what we would hear from the Greens this morning would be attacks on Labor, and it was, because it always is, because the Greens exist to take votes from Labor, to take seats from Labor and to actually guarantee the re-election of LNP governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, if we needed any proof of that, let's look at the founder of the Greens party, Bob Brown, and what he had to say about the notorious Adani convoy that ran through Queensland last year, contributing to the re-election of this government. He said that he was very proud of the Adani convoy; it had achieved its objective by returning Senator Waters to this chamber. It didn't matter that, in the process, it led to the re-election of an LNP government that even the Greens say is destroying the climate. That wasn't their concern. Their only concern is to come after Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As for this notion that the Greens holding the balance of power would be a good thing for the climate, let's just remember the last time there was a Labor government with the Greens in the balance of power in the Senate. They blocked Labor's initiative around the CPRS. Why on earth would you let the Greens have the balance of power if you actually want action on climate change? The only way to have action on climate change is to elect a majority Labor government, and that's exactly what we intend to do at the next election.</span>

It's a bit like being at a bad family gathering. But the simple fact is: what we have to see and what we are committed to seeing is not the posturing of those opposite nor the bickering of those opposite, but simply calmly getting on with the job of investing in the technologies that reduce emissions whilst protecting the jobs of Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are three quick facts. Firstly, between 2005 and 2019, Australia's emissions fell faster than Canada's, faster than New Zealand's, faster than Japan's, faster than Korea's and faster than those of the United States. Action in this country is real and is seeing a reduction in emissions. Indeedâ€”the second factâ€”Australia beat our 2020 emissions reduction targets by 459 million tonnes. When we've made commitments to the world, we've honoured themâ€”we've deliveredâ€”and we've exceeded them, and we are on track to meet and beat our 26 to 28 per cent reduction targets by 2030. Lastly, we are committed to the Paris Agreement and its goals, as well as to achieving net zero emissions as soon as possible. I move:</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:51</span>):  This afternoon we're here to debate the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Subsidy) Bill 2021, and what we are seeing today is the government finally admitting that they've been keeping the foot on the neck of working families and hurting the mental state and wellbeing of Australian families as well as their economic security. Their need to bring this bill forward is an admission that their much-lauded changes of a few years ago have become a burden on Australian families, just as Labor predicted that they would. So, as we enter into this debate today, from the outset, it's timely for me to move a second reading amendment. I move:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian families have been left voiceless and disadvantaged by this government. One of the most pathetic news presences of recent times was the specimen from the coalition party room that said that women using child care were 'outsourcing parenting'. Access to affordable, quality child care is a fundamental cornerstone of economic participation in our country. It's a fundamental cornerstone of the economic wellbeing of families with children. In order to meet their family's needs, a parent needs to be working as a single parent or, in a two-parent family, often you need two parents working. This is the quality of the debate that the coalition had internally around these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has wasted a lot of oxygen trying to deny many of the hard facts in relation to child care in our nation. Long day care fees have gone up by 2.4 per cent in 2020, and that included four months of their free childcare experimentâ€”four months where fees couldn't go up at all. We've seen that overall fees went up by 2.4 per cent. They've hiked 9.3 per cent under Prime Minister Morrison's new childcare subsidy. Fees are now up 37.2 per cent since the election of the coalition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this government doesn't like to talk about this data. Their mismanagement is not only hurting the 'selfish' women who need the support of this package but also holding families back from work. There are almost 100,000 families in our nation not working due to the cost of child care. As a telling example of this, I had a senior psychiatrist in Western Australia come to me, just a couple of weeks ago, desperate that something be done about the cost and affordability of childcare because, as he said to me, the cost and affordability and inaccessibility of child care was contributing to his ability to recruit psychiatrists into the workforce, psychiatrists that support the developmental needs of children and, indeed, the mental health of Australians. The cost of child care is having an impact in so many ways. Research from the Front Project based on a survey of 1,700 families found 73 per cent of families say the cost of child care is a barrier to them having more children. What a sad and sorry state of affairs. And 52 per cent agreed that once the cost of child care is factored in it's hardly worth working.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has always argued that the system is broken and that the system under this coalition government is completely busted. That's why we announced our own ambitious plan to make child care cheaper for one million families, a million families who need it most. The Morrison-Joyce government know this too. That's why they were pulled kicking and screaming into making the modest changes that we have before us in this bill today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we look at the bill itself, we can see that schedule 1 removes the annual childcare subsidy cap from the family assistance act so there will no longer be a limit on the amount of subsidy that families over a specified income year can receive. The annual cap was a terrible policy. It was always a terrible policy. It has served as a serious barrier to second income earners in a family, usually a woman, working the hours that they want and need andâ€”in the kinds of skills shortages that we are facing in Australia currently, which are very evident in Western Australiaâ€”working the hours that our economy also needs them to work.<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>It was such a bad idea. Nobody ever, ever recommended it. The Productivity Commission didn't when they were asked to design a new subsidy scheme by the government back in 2015. They certainly didn't include it in their design, so who came up with this idea? The social services minister did, and that social services minister was Mr Scott Morrison. Abolishing Mr Morrison's cap was a terrific idea, so great that it is already Labor policy and part of our plan for cheaper child care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments in schedule 2 will increase the rate of childcare subsidy by 30 percentage points but only for second and subsequent children aged under six up to a maximum rate of 95 per cent. As we know, this measure has been implemented through a two-phased approach to ensure implementation can occur as soon as possible, but allow sufficient time for the system to build support for the change in policy and to put in place integrity measures. These changes to the subsidy provide income, some extra support for some families, in a short period of time, and in that context Labor supports the bill. But it is a disgrace that there is not more help and more support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's pre-budget announcement promised a lot, but, as this bill demonstrates today, it delivers very little. Like everything with this government, it is all flash and no substance, as we've seen again and again. The problem with this bill is that not many families at all will see a cent of extra help. Three-quarters of families in the system will still get nothing. The government announced a complex and restrictive policy that only benefits families with at least two children below school age in care. Families will need a mathematics degree to understand their subsidy under this new system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Any passing analysis of the Labor and Liberal childcare policies shows unequivocally that the Labor policy provides more support to more families for longer. Eighty-six per cent of all families with children under the age of six in the system would be better off under Labor's policy. The vast majority of families with two children in child care and a combined family income of between just over $69,000 and just under $174,000 would be better off under Labor's policy. Any extra support the Liberals have in this package for families with two children is only temporary. It's ripped away when the family's older child goes to school, no matter that the older child is still likely to need after-school-hours care. What a ridiculous prospectâ€”to give and then take it immediately away! How is a family supposed to continue to juggle participating in the workforce with two children if the extra support you put in place just suddenly disappears? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's boost in support will be provided to every child for the entire time they are in child care. We will also get the ACCC to design a price regulation mechanism to shed light on costs and fees and to drive them down for good. The Productivity Commission, under Labor, will also conduct a comprehensive review of the sector with the aim of implementing a universal 90 per cent subsidy for all families. This is critical, in Labor's view, not only for working families, to get them participating, but indeed for the access of children to early childhood education and care. It's a plan that's good for families, a plan that's good for the economy and a plan that's good for children's wellbeing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here, today, we support this bill because something today is better than nothing. But it is little wonder to us on this side of the chamber that this government doesn't want to talk about its childcare policy. Those opposite know it is a pathetic scrap of a policy. The government's own workforce papers show that the workforce participation rate will fall even after these changes are introduced, and, with closed borders and people screaming out for jobs and skills in the economy, this is unsustainable. We need a strategy to lift participation in the workforce, and child care is key. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that only this government could design a childcare policy in the depths of Treasury that won't help working families more. We need to get Australians back working the hours they want and need and the hours our economy needs. Early learning and child care are absolutely fundamental to this. Labor knows this, but members of the Morrison-Joyce government clearly don't. Some of them clearly think that child care is just glorified, expensive babysitting. There was even talk in the coalition that aiding working families was forcing women back to work, as though respecting a woman's right to work had been a new and unexamined prospect for the coalition up until this point. I have to ask: what century are we in here? It is 2021, and we have members of the Morrison-Joyce government shaming parents for using child care and needing a reminder to respect the right of women to choose how to balance their work and family life. I know that juggling children and work can be difficult in terms of creating a balance, but how is only being able to afford two or three days of child care a week and, in order to work the other days, juggling informal care contributing to the quality of that juggle? These are not choices that the coalition is offering families and especially women. It is completely and utterly out of touch. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is embarrassing that this government has taken this approach and has delivered to the nation this quality of debate around these issues. To make matters worse, they even called for more incentives for women to stay home. This ignores the structural incentive they've created to encourage women not to workâ€”their record-high childcare fees. It ignores the fact that many women and families do work full time and only access child care for some of the days during that week. Sometimes they survive well with grandparental care, but sometimes informal care is an inconvenienceâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:06</span>):  [by video link] I speak to the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Subsidy) Bill 2021. The bill removes the annual cap on childcare subsidy, CCS, payments to families and increases the maximum rate of the childcare subsidy for second and subsequent children where a family has more than one child under six years of age. These are the two measures that were announced in the 2021-22 budget. The measures, once implemented, will clearly provide some amount of relief to some families from the expensive and burdensome cost of early learning and care, and for that reason the Greens will support the bill. Any funding boost for early learning is welcome, but let's be real: the proposed bill will not fix the fundamental problems with the current system of early childhood education and care, which is underfunded, with some of the highest fees in the world. The most sensible and equitable move would be to make child care universal and free. Expensive early learning has held women, children and families back for far too long. The benefits of free early learning and care for families and the whole community are beyond doubt. </span>

The IPCC report that came out yesterday was devastating. Science and scientists are telling us that, even under the most ambitious emissions reduction scenarios, the world is now likely to heat to 1.5 degrees or more above pre-industrial levels by 2040. The other big tragedy is that the Liberals have tied our country to the least ambitious targets, while they spruik coal and gas, and the Labor Partyâ€”</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. There is a second reading amendment which I foreshadow. Here we are talking about children, their education and their future. There is a definite need to talk about their future under the devastation and destruction which will happen if we don't take immediate and urgent action on climate change. And kudos to the children who took the matter of the Australian government's responsibility towards them to the court. It is a pretty shameful abrogation of responsibility towards our children and the next generation by this government and the environment minister, who are appealing against that landmark court rulingâ€”that the minister doesn't have a duty of care to protect Australian children from the climate harm caused by the potential expansion of a coalmine. It does cause harm to children and the next generation. The government, if they don't act on the climate crisis, are nothing but climate criminals and environmental vandals. My colleague Senator Waters will be moving a second reading amendment to highlight the impacts of the climate crisis on children and their future. It should be our top priority to do something about it. This bill just tinkers around the edges. It is way past the time of tinkering around the edges and procrastinating on real and lasting change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government loves to talk up its incremental minor changes to the childcare subsidy as a huge win for families, but, on the face of it, that is not the case. Many families with a single child in care will not receive any benefit whatsoever. Even this bill before us today is flawed by design. The government was rightly criticised in May, when the package was announced, for its measures not coming into effect until July 2022. That's 14 whole months between the announcement by the education minister and actual fee relief in family's pockets. We will have had a federal election by the time these measures come into effect. The minister may not even be the minister by the time this is all implemented, and I hope that he isn't. Come next election, I hope that the people of this country would have kicked out the Morrison government and the Greens would be in shared power so we can push for creating a fairer and more equal society. But there are a few months to go before this can become a reality. Women, children and families can get some relief from extra payments right now. From the providers that I have spoken to, there seems to be no good reason why the start date could not be brought forward. The government has pointed to the complexity of changing IT systems. I'm sorry, but, in the age of COVID-19 when we've seen how systems can be redesigned and payments can be reprioritised seemingly overnight when deemed urgent enough, that doesn't cut it at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In any case, I note the education minister, in his second reading speech, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is anticipated we will be able commence implementation by July 2022. Should it be possible to bring the commencement of the measure forward, we will do this so that families can benefit sooner. That is why the bill makes it possible for earlier implementation, with the date to be set by proclamation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, the minister is feeling the heat. I will be moving an amendment at the committee stage that will bring the date forward to 1 July 2021 so families can realise the benefit of the package now. I ask senators to support this amendment because it provides certainty and doesn't leave it just up to the minister and their whim to decide what the date will be and when it can be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More generally, we need to think in much bigger and more ambitious ways about the future of our early learning and care system. The dire state of affairs for early learning and care in this country requires nothing less of us. This is the first time during the health crisis that the government has grudgingly recognised that child care is an essential service, and thousands of families have benefited from that. The pandemic has opened up a conversation about the long-term viability of our existing approach to child care. This is an opportunity too good to let slip away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a compelling case for free and universally available early childhood education and care, and it would have enormous social and economic benefits for our community. Too often women have to give up work and career opportunities because child care is too expensive or just not available. Children get the enormous benefit of early education when it is accessible for all. Removing all barriers to access not only creates equity but also has a huge pay-off for the whole society. So let's stop entrenching gender inequality. Let's stop deepening intergenerational inequality. Let's make corporations pay their fair share. Let's tax the billionaires into oblivion. Let's not hand back public money to the wealthiest in society, and let's use some of these funds to invest in making child care universal and free.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should also be expanding publicly provided services to families so families aren't reliant on for-profit centresâ€”because education is not a business. It's time early childhood education was funded and provided as the essential service that it is. We should also be ensuring fair and decent pay for early childhood educators. Early childhood educators should receive professional pay, reflecting the skill and responsibility of the work they do every single day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that point, I want to make a special mention of early childhood educators following the release of a report from Big Steps and the United Workers Union this morning. This was a survey of more than 3,800 educators. It found that the sector is at breaking point, with high turnover, low pay and no plan from the federal government to fix it. The report makes for very alarming reading. It tells a story of government neglect, an undervalued workforce, privatisation and an essential service delivered on the back of burnt-out staff. Just a few statistics from this report illustrates this dire situation. Thirty-seven per cent of educators said that they do not intend to stay in the sector long term and, of this group, 74 per cent intend to leave within the next three years. Over 60 per cent of educators said that they have often come to work or stayed at work sick due to staff shortages. Seventy per cent of educators surveyed said that they always or often worry about their financial situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a national shame that early educators are taken for granted in this country. Staff are leaving in droves and, frankly, the sector is in crisis. We should not be in a situation of chronic understaffing and high turnover. The government needs to completely rethink its approach to early learning and care, and that means strong and sustained investment to make early childhood education free once more and a workforce that deals directly with issues of low pay and understaffing. I have a second reading amendment that calls for the Senate to reaffirm that child care should be free and universal for all children and that workers and educators in the sector deserve higher wages and better conditions to reflect the immense value of their massive contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to indicate that the Greens will be supporting Labor's second reading amendment, while acknowledging that it does not really go as far as to address the issues facing the childcare system. While this bill allows the minister to bring forward the commencement of the changes, it doesn't make sure that it actually does happen. That's why I will be moving an amendment to bring the date forward. Ultimately, while this bill does provide some relief for some families, and the Greens support that, it's still a tiny step forward in a long journey that we have to embark upon to ensure that our early learning system is equitable, universal, appropriate and there and available for all families.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:18</span>):  I too rise to speak in support of the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Subsidy) Bill 2021 and I really do take great pleasure in doing so. Step by step and reform by reform we are making child care more accessible for Australian families, particularly for those families that most need it. This builds on the previous reforms that we have made to the childcare sector which have made a significant difference to families and which have also been well received by industry and childcare providers. This bill represents this next step. It gives effect to the Morrison government's commitment to make child care as accessible as possible. It is all about supporting families and backing them in the workforce safely knowing that their kids are getting the best possible care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill targets additional supports to all CCS-eligible Australian families who have more than one child aged under six in child care. This is around 250,000 families, who will benefit by around $2,260 per year. That's a significant number of families, from right around the nation, and they're going to see the practical impact of what we do here in this place. That's what it's all about. While those on the other side are often hell-bent on scoring political points, using the most inappropriate topicsâ€”we've just heard contributions along those linesâ€”we're over here plugging away, putting in place the reforms that deliver a practical outcome for Australian families. We're listening to them. We're delivering for them. We always have, and we always will.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those on the other side often couldn't care less. They're more concerned about the things that do quite the opposite: undermining the vaccine rollout, playing politics with the pandemic. But over here we're talking about a reform that is going to impact 250,000 families across the nation, putting money back into their pocket. That's what we committed to do at the last election, and that's what we're following through with here, even with this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From the middle of next year we will increase the childcare subsidy available to families who have more than one child under the age of six in child care. This means that families who have more than one child in child care will see their level of subsidy increase by 30 percentage points to a maximum subsidy of 95 per cent of fees paid for their second child and subsequent children. Around 50 per cent of families who benefit from the measureâ€”those earning less than about $130,000â€”will receive the maximum 95 per cent subsidy for their second child and subsequent children. These families will pay, on average, $21 a day for two children in child care. Around 95 per cent of families who benefit from the measureâ€”those earning about $250,000â€”will receive a subsidy of at least 80 per cent for their second child and subsequent children, paying, on average, $73 or less per day for two children in child care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll also remove the $10,560 annual cap on the childcare subsidy for families earning over $189,390, benefiting around 18,000 families. This means that families with multiple children don't exhaust their childcare subsidy cap sooner in the year for younger children. Those families shouldn't be at a disadvantageâ€”quite the opposite: we need more Australians to be having kids. As Peter Costello famously said, have one for mum, one for dad and one for the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes will put more money into the hands of Australian families, especially those who need it most. Those on the lowest incomes will continue to receive the highest rate of subsidy. This is a core principle of our childcare subsidy. It will ensure that families are supported to access affordable early learning and care. The activity test remains in place to ensure that families are undertaking activities such as working, training or studying in order to be eligible for childcare subsidies. This is a very sensible measure. This measure reduces workforce disincentives for families and encourages parentsâ€”especially second-income earners, who are more often womenâ€”to go back to work or to work more if they choose to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this mean in practical terms? It means that families who have two children in care for five days a week, 50 weeks of the year, and are earning $60,000 will save $52 week, will be entitled to an 85 per cent subsidy for their first child and a 95 per cent subsidy for their second child and will receive $936 in a weekly subsidy, with an out-of-pocket cost of $104. Those earning $100,000 will save $102 a week, will be entitled to a 75.4 per cent subsidy for their first child and a 95 per cent subsidy for their second child and will receive $886 in a weekly subsidy, with out-of-pocket costs of $154. Those earning $180,000 will save $156 a week, will be entitled to a 50 per cent subsidy for their first child and an 80 per cent subsidy for their second child and will receive $676 in a weekly subsidy, with out-of-pocket costs of $364.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the year, the average savings for families as a result of these changes will be $783 for families earning under $70,000, noting that these families already receive a very high subsidy for all children in care; $1,650 for families earning between $70,000 and $120,000; and $2,804 for families earning between $120,000 and $150,000. This support is targeted towards those who need the most assistance. Sixty per cent of the additional investment goes to families earning under $180,000. The maximum childcare subsidy rate will increase to 95 per cent for the second and subsequent child, which means lower-income families, who already receive very high levels of childcare subsidy, will still benefit from these changes. Importantly, all types, except in home care where a family rate is paid, are covered. The measure is primarily intended to support children attending long day care and family day care as this is where most children aged under six attend child care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that the government assistance remains targeted to ensure that it is sustainable over the long term. This government believes that these settings strike the right balance between providing targeted assistance to those that need it most while maintaining fiscal responsibility. Other models recommend providing assistance to high-income families, including those earning well above $350,000. Those models go against our core principles for the childcare package.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, it is all about choice. I know that there are a variety of views in this place on child care. That is fair enough. But this is about giving Australian families options, letting them make the decisions that impact on them based on what works for them and what they think is in their best interests. If parents want to put their children in child care and continue to be in the workforce, pursuing a career and supporting their family, that's great. They ought to be supported to be able to make that choice. If a parent decides to remain at home then that is also good, if that is what is in their interests and what they want to do for their family. This isn't a one-size-fits-all policy for families; they need to decide what's best for them and their own families. They are in the best possible position to do that. It's not our place as legislators to be dictating to Australian families what they need to be doing. It is up to them to decide. That's what we are doing. We are backing them to do that. We are backing them. We are backing them with both of those options. We are providing that choice. These are thoroughly Liberal policies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With that, I believe that we should keep working to make child care more accessible to those that want to take it up. This bill is just that next step, but it isn't the end. We need to keep plugging away, consulting with parents, providers and industry to continue to make reforms which make child care sustainable, accessible and of the highest possible standard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing I believe that we should be looking at as part of this next step in support and in continuing with these reforms is policies such as income splitting. We know that the early years in a child's development are the most critical. Splitting income for taxation assessment purposes will provide further choice to parents. It will also simplify the options for parents, including supporting a parent that chooses to stay at home or even facilitating informal paid childcare arrangements with grandparents and the like. Income splitting will go a long way to making child care even more accessible to families and backing them as they plan for their financial future. It is something that I strongly believe we should be putting forward in the next tranche of reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill supports choice. It backs Aussie families and it will put more money back into their pockets. I commend this bill to the Senate and I commend, indeed, the Morrison government for backing families to make the right decisions for their own circumstances.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:29</span>):  [by video link] The latest report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has found that South Australia is already facing more extreme heat, drought and catastrophic bushfires and less average rainfallâ€”we've already experienced less rainfall and an increase in droughtsâ€”and this will have a disastrous effect on our health, agriculture and biodiversity. The report predicts a temperature increase of 1.5 degrees by about 2030 based on our current trajectory. What will our children say to this knowing that we had this report? They'll look to us, to our policies, to the decisions made by those of us in this place and ask, 'What did you do?' The report is unequivocal: human activity is responsible for rising temperature levels, and the scale of recent changes to our climate is likely unprecedented.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are still those opposite who continue to deny and to question the science, but we cannot afford this. We cannot afford further delays on action on climate change. The UN Secretary-General has declared the report a code red emergency for the world. He said the alarm bells are deafening and the evidence is irrefutable. The government cannot ignore this any longer. The report made clear that Australia is in particular peril. Sea levels around Australian and New Zealand have already risen higher than the global average and will likely continue rising. Fires are more frequent, and fire seasons are lasting longer. Heavy rainfall and floods are projected to worsen, and across South Australia drought has already increased, and projections suggest this will worsen. The only way to turn this around in terms of policy in Australia is to change the government. This is a warning of the greatest urgency. This is an emergency, and I urge more action from the government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  [by video link] I rise to pay tribute to doctors and health professionals everywhere, but especially those in our rural towns and those who train them. James Cook University in my home town of Townsville can lay claim to being Australia's most successful university in producing medical graduates who go on to work as doctors in regional, rural and remote locations. It is the only university contracted by the federal government to offer the Australian General Practice Training program, which delivers across 90 per cent of Queensland, servicing about 1.6 million people, including two-thirds of the state's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Seventy-five per cent of the almost 1,800 JCU medical graduates since 2005 have gone on to work in regional and remote locations for periods of 12 months or more, and of that number 1,000 are still in those locationsâ€”an extraordinary achievement. Of the 424 GP fellows who completed general practice training with JCU, four out of five were working in regional and remote locations six months post fellowship. JCU's model relies heavily on practical training in rural locations so participants can live, learn and work with qualified doctors to see what it's really like. One GP involved in this training who I'd like to mention is Dr Leonie Fromberg, from the Flinders Medical Centre in Cloncurry in north-western Queensland. She and others like her make JCU's program a shining light in medical training in this country. I'm proud to support the university's efforts in this endeavour and I'm proud to be part of a federal government that has a ministry dedicated to rural health and rural doctor training. I encourage any medical students wanting to learn the whole range of skills to go west, where the traffic is light, the air is clean and the people are friendly.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I learnt about the science of the greenhouse effect as a young student of climate science 40 years ago. It was a shocking truth that set me on my path to become a campaigner for the wellbeing of life on this planet and to being here in this place.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first IPCC report came out in 1990, a lifetime ago for my two adult kids. They, like all young people, have lived their lives with the knowledge of the climate crisis hanging like a noose around their futures. Yet our government are still looking after their billionaire mates and their fossil fuel donors while our future is literally going up in flames. We have to kick them out.</span>

Hand in hand with the government, they're hell-bent on unleashing a huge carbon bomb on the planet, with more coalmines and by fracking vast tracts of the sovereign lands First Nations peoples. They're silent about what needs to happen by 2030, when we have to have slashed our pollution. Delay is the new denialism.</span>

We can elect a new government, with the Greens in balance of power, that will commit Australia to science based targets for 2030. It will commit to getting out of mining coal, gas and oil so we can play our part in giving humanity, and all life on this planet, the chance of a healthy future.</span>

I also express my concern for residents and businesses in Cairns, who also are now facing a lockdown, which hopefully won't last for too long.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite apart from COVID-19, over the weekend a new threat to the lives and livelihoods of not just South-East Queenslanders but all Queenslanders emerged in South-East Queenslandâ€”a new threat that is intent on coming all the way down from Queensland to Canberra and wreaking havoc, just like we've seen it do before. What is that threat? 'Hello, Newman.' That's right: it's former LNP Premier Campbell Newman. He's back from the dead. Like the zombie apocalypse, he just will not go away. Now he's here to terrorise not just Queenslanders but Senator Stoker, Senator McGrath and Senator Canavan as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the former LNP Premier who cut 14,000 jobs from the Queensland Public Service; who cut health services; who closed and sold schools; who tried to privatise our power network; who abolished literary awards; who commenced a war with traditional LNP supporters, like lawyers and doctors; and, of course, who curbed civil liberties in Queensland in a way we had not seen since Joh Bjelke-Petersen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a very real risk that if Campbell Newman is elected to the Senate along with the Morrison government being returned they will do to Australia exactly what they did to Queensland when Campbell Newman was the Premier. He will team up with the Liberal and National coalition to cut jobs, cut services and cut all sorts of civil liberties that we enjoy right now, just like he and the LNP did when he was the Premier in Queensland.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a very clear message for Queenslanders: if you want secure jobs, vote Labor in the House and vote Labor in the Senate. If you want quality services, vote Labor in the House and the Senate. If you want job cuts, vote for the LNP and Campbell Newman.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 1.67 million people have flooded into Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic, while Australians themselves are virtually imprisoned in their own states and homes. It's an appalling double standard. Australian workers and families can't cross domestic borders, yet thousands and thousands of international workers and visitors have been given a free pass to cross the international border. The latest international visa and arrival data reveals the Morrison government issued more than 20,000 visas in June this year, and has issued more than 164,000 since April last year. These include more than 46,000 work related visas, 25,000 temporary visitor visas, almost 3,000 student visas, more than 26,000 family visas and 63,000 other permanent and temporary visas.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Prime Minister keeps the international border open, premiers will continue to slam state borders shut and put millions of people into lockdowns that are destroying lives, jobs and businesses, breaking our economy and leaving a huge legacy of public debt. Scott Morrison may not be able to control state borders, but he can shut the gate to foreign arrivals who are bringing COVID-19 to our shores. He should give an end date of 1 December for people to be vaccinatedâ€”if they wish, not forcedâ€”then declare no more state border closures. He should set a target to open international borders by May 2022.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is quite evident what is happening around the world: people are learning to live with COVID. No government or business has a right to coerce, bully, bribe or threaten people into being vaccinated. That sounds like a communist regime to me, not a democracy. We can't continue with these lockdowns. Something has to give.</span>

Unfortunately some of them did not do so in a respectful way, and they deserve to have the book thrown at them. It is absolutely every Australian's right to protest and have their views heard, but it is not their right to deface public property and it is not their right to come into the heart of our democracy and graffiti their own views on the front of the building, to the exclusion of Australians with different views. This is an absolute disgrace that has been abetted and facilitated by the Australian Greens in this chamber. They should hang their heads in shame that they are associated with people who show such a lack of respect for other Australians and for the institutions of this democracy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that the protesters who were out there today don't want to change the climate; that's not their goal. They're not there to change the climate. They're there to change our government, to change our democracy. They do not support democracy. They do not support our systems of government. The reason we know that is that, if those protesters were serious about changing the climate and reducing emissions, they would have walked down to the Chinese Communist Party embassy, just down the road, and protested against the biggest carbon emitter in this place. But they don't do that, because a lot of those activists and some of the people in the Australian Greens kind of like communism. I reckon they're kind of in favour of it. That's why they're not protesting against communists. They're not really worried about the climate; they're wanting to radically change our society and to do so in a way that shows no respect for their fellow Australians. Anyone associating with these vandals and juveniles should be denounced, and anyone who does not denounce them deserves no respect in the Australian democratic political system.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, for a great number of us, those triumphant and inspiring moments were marred by the barrage of gambling ads shown during ad breaks. Under Australian law, gambling ads cannot be shown between 4 pm and 7 pm on any broadcast and on children's programming between 5 am and 8.30 pm. But so many of our Olympic achievements, moments many Australians shared with their children, were broadcast outside of these hours and totally escaped the restrictions. It is absolutely time for us to reconsider those limited restrictions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A report published by the Australian Gambling Research Centre showed that one in three Australians opened a new online betting account during the pandemic last yearâ€”one in threeâ€”and this led them to gamble more often and for larger amounts. No doubt many of these people were influenced by advertising, the same type of advertising seen by our children during the Olympics. Tragically, some new gamblers will soon find themselves in financial difficulty, setting off a chain reaction that can ruinâ€”and has ruinedâ€”lives and families. It is well and truly time for this government to act to permanently remove gambling ads from television and radio and from online platforms. This is needed to help protect our young and to protect future generations.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  I rise today to speak on the 2021 census. It's a critically important survey of our nation which has tremendous impact on the work of parliament. I want to call out a campaign led by Humanists Australia in their effort to get Australians to tick the non-religious box. I strongly support every Australian answering the census as honestly as possibleâ€”people of faith and people of no faithâ€”but I'm deeply troubled by the campaign's motives. In the Humanists Australia CEO's recent op-ed in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span>, she explicitly cites the reason for her campaign as to strip funding from religious schools and activities. This is spiteful, misinformed and wrong. We should be celebrating Australia's rich religious pluralism, not mocking it. At a time of rising anti-Semitism, we should be supporting Jewish institutions and schools to be safer. We should be supporting Islamic, Catholic, Christian and other faith and other educationally ideological schools, as well as government schools, and, to do so, we need to have the factsâ€”hence, a truthful census.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the gaps in our social safety net grow ever larger, we should not be seeking to curb the work of religious charities and aged-care homes, which are in greater need during a COVID crisis than ever. Religion brings joy and comfort to many Australians of the Islamic, Christian, Hindu, Baha'i, Sikh and Buddhist faiths and all the other faiths that give people meaning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This opportunistic and spiteful campaign to take funding away from religious institutions is simply wrong. I encourage every Australian, on this census day 2021, to be honestâ€”be honest in the census; tell the truthâ€”because you will give us the real face of Australia. Do not respond to spite. Inform your answers with good conscience and tell Australia who we really are.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  This morning, we saw an act of complete bastardry against the Australian people here at Australian Parliament House. The Greens support group Extinction Rebellion vandalised this placeâ€”the people's house, as it is known. This is what happens when you choose slogans over actions. Labor and the Greens have continually used slogans. We, the Morrison government, choose actionsâ€”actions like beating our Kyoto target by 439 million tonnes; actions like having the most rooftop solar photovoltaic in the world; actions like reducing 639 million tonnes of carbon emissions in the last two years, the equivalent of taking all Australian carsâ€”that is 14.7 million carsâ€”off the road; actions like $20 billion of committed investment in new clean energy, to drive over $80 billion of public and private innovation, creating an estimated 160,000 jobs. We are a government of actions, not slogansâ€”actions that actually reduce emissions, not destroy jobs or impose costs on Australian households, businesses and industries.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The acts of vandalism are typical of the other side of this chamber. It's their approach; it's all noise and no action. When it comes to addressing an issue such as climate change, only meaningful action will deliver the results. Slogans won't do it. The members opposite here, who have celebrated this morning's acts of bastardry, should be ashamed of themselves, and I trust that the ACT Magistrates Court will deal with the rest.</span>

Today, again, shipbuilding is in the news. The poster child for failed Defence projects used to be the Super Seasprite helicopter; it was overtaken by the Joint Strike Fighter, and that has been overshadowed now by the Future Submarine project. Future Submarine is so big it is ensuring that its shipbuilding mates, the future frigates and the OPVs, are obscured in its shadows.</span>

They will apparently have five days in quarantine there and it is a bit unclear as to whether they will then go into detention or the community.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  Last week big, aggressive, foreign-owned, multinational corporation JBS announced it is buying into Huon Aquaculture, diving into the troubled, divisive and controversial Tasmanian salmon industry. I and many Tasmaniansâ€”those who have fought against the past decade of crony capitalism in the state's salmon industry and fought for transparency, truth, robust and independent regulation in the industryâ€”hold grave concerns over this. This takeover of Huon Aquaculture signals a new wave of industrialisation of our beloved waterways, oceans and beaches. The JBS Global CEO told media that the takeover of Huon is:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ a strategic acquisition â€¦ Aquaculture will be a new growth platform for our businesses. We will repeat what we did previously with poultry, pork and value-added products to make our portfolio even more complete.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why am I and so many Tasmanians concerned? During its rapid rise to become the world's biggest meat packer, JBS and its network of subsidiaries have been linked to allegations of high-level corruptionâ€”including the biggest fine in corporate history, $3.2 billion, after bribing hundreds of politiciansâ€”modern day slave labour practices; illegal deforestation, particularly in the Amazon; animal welfare violations; major hygiene breaches and price fixing, including fines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I warn JBS that they won't be expanding in Tasmanian waterways without a fight, a significant community fight. I know JBS already exist in the beef industry in Tasmania. I know they have significant influence with government. I know many farmers have had dealings with JBSâ€”some speak highly of the company. I say to JBS that this is an opportunity for you to put the industry on to a sustainable footprintâ€”make sure we have an independent, robust, fully funded environmental protection agency. I ask them to support the Greens' bill to do this.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  Yesterday in this place there was a discussion in relation to global Magnitsky laws. I think it is incredibly important that whenever we discuss these laws we remember and pay tribute to the man who inspired them, Sergei Magnitsky. Sergei Magnitsky was a son, a husband and a father, a man who uncovered a $230 million corruption and fraud scandal in Russia. He spent 11 months in jail without trial. Only eight days before he was required to be released, he died in prison at the age of 37. So, when we talk about the global Magnitsky laws, let's always remember the man who inspired them and the story of his sacrifice. Let's remember the words of his family. When Sergei was nominated for the Allard Prize, this is what they said about their husband and father:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Sergei was so outraged by the theft of $230 million dollars of taxes which should have gone to state recipients like pensioners, schools, the disabled, and hospitals, that he stood up in the belief that truth and justice would prevail. Others might have backed down in the face of the immense pressure he was subjected to, but he did not. That would have meant compromising his own integrity and sense of honesty and he could never do that. He believed that he was acting for the greater good of his country and fellow citizens. He wanted to be a shining example to his colleagues, friends and family.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  I rise this afternoon to express my dismay that victims of the Sterling Income Trust collapse have been left out of the compensation scheme of last resort as currently drafted by Treasury. There are a few days to go before the consultations close, so I encourage people to complain. The government dragged their feet in putting this scheme together, yet, in the meantime, they encouraged Sterling victims to lodge complaints with AFCA so they could be considered under a future scheme. They also claimed that the global financial crisis meant they could not make progress on the scheme, yet, in the meantime, while encouraging people to apply to AFCA, they suspended AFCA's ability to assess those complaints.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the government's concerned about the system being gamed, and I understand those concerns. But these people deserve redressâ€”the redress that they have won in the courts. They've been encouraged by the government to take their case to AFCA and to the courts; it's what the government advised them to do. The royal commission said there should be a retrospective and prospective scheme for compensation and the determinations that have been made should be honoured. Many of the people impacted by this scheme, the Stirling Income Trust collapse, have had their financial security utterly destroyed. They've seen their housing security utterly collapse. They were promised restitution, and I urge the government to act.</span>

It came out last night. It should not be a surprise to anyoneâ€”it's appalling. Yet I bet that, in question time today, we will hear the Morrison government congratulating each other on how you are doing so well. You are not.

As I said to the chamber a moment ago, I don't have with me the specific date that the first order was placed. I'm happy to take that on notice and confirm that for the chamber. It forms a very important part of the overall vaccine strategy. The way that the government have managed the introduction of new vaccines into the country is to ensure that we've had full data available to the country via the TGA to ensure that the vaccines that we're utilising have high levels of efficacy and are safe. We, through the TGA, took just 23 days to approve the utilisation of the Moderna vaccine. We have used all our resources to ensure that we could have access to this vaccine as quickly as was safely possible so that it could be incorporated into the vaccine rollout program.</span>

I won't apologise for that and nor would the government. It is important to ensure that there is vaccine confidence within the Australian community and that we have taken the approach that we have. Australians can be confident that the vaccines that are approved for use here in Australia have been fully approved by the TGA. They can have confidence in the TGA and ATAGI and Australians can be confident in taking up the vaccines that have been approved for the vaccine rollout in Australia. It's the Labor Party who continue to undermine the confidence of Australians with their negative attitude and negative tactics, attacking the vaccine rollout. The Labor Party should be ashamed of their approach to the vaccine rollout.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the economic framework to assist businesses to prosper, to grow and to create more jobs, that is exactly how the Morrison government approached the recent 2021-22 budget, with the Minister for Finance, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister delivering a budget that puts in place the policies that well and truly back Australia's 3.5 million small and family businesses. Our economic measures are all about giving businesses the confidence to invest and to take on a new staff member but also to get back to doing what they do best if they've been affected by COVID-19. We're investing $7.2 million to improve and maintain a new Employment Contract Tool, making it easier for small businesses to take on that new staff member but, at the same time, meet all of their obligations. We're also expanding Digital Solutions with an investment of $12.7 million, which will support an additional 10,000 businesses to improve their digital capability and further encourage uptake of digital technology in small businesses, because what has COVID-19 in particular taught us? It's that businesses do need to have that digital capability. Of course, on the government side of the chamber, we understand that red tape strangles business, and that's why we are continuing to back in our deregulation agenda with $134.6 million being invested to make measures easier, to make it easier to employ people, and to reduce the regulatory burden for businesses of interacting with the government.</span>

Through measures that we are implementing, such as the temporary full expensing and the loss carry-back arrangements, we are delivering a further $20.7 billion in tax relief to Australian businesses that back themselves and invest in their future. What we also note is that the initial round of business tax incentives has been highly effective. Machinery and equipment investment has been growing at its fastest rate in seven years. What you see is that businesses who have that capacity are out there, and they're utilising the policies that the government is putting in place to back themselves and to invest back into their businesses. This means that the local cafe, the local construction company and even the local plumber have been able to utilise the policies that the Morrison government has put in place to reinvest in themselves, prosper, grow andâ€”what we're all aboutâ€”create more jobs for Australians.</span>

On the Morrison government's side of the chamber, lowering taxes is in our DNA. Certainly, when you look at the estimated $320 billion worth of investment that is expected to be supported by our business tax incentives and create 60,000 jobs by the end of 2022-23, we understand that, by keeping taxes low and helping businesses keep more of what they earnâ€”after all, it is their money; they've earnt their moneyâ€”we can continue to secure our economic recovery into the future. </span>

We did not take, as an election policy, to the last election $387 billion in higher taxes.

The Prime Minister has acknowledged the importance of the report in continuing to inform Australia's efforts in delivering emissions reductionsâ€”our successful efforts, as a nation, in delivering emissions reductionsâ€”and the importance of unified global action in dealing with emissions. </span>

                  </a>  I hear the interjections from those opposite, saying, 'How embarrassing!' By comparison, our 20 per cent stands alongside a one per cent reduction in Canada, a 10 per cent reduction in Japan, a four per cent reduction in New Zealand or a 13 per cent reduction in the United States. I make those comparisons not to criticise any of those nations but to highlight for those opposite and those who, in the debate in Australia, seek to paint a proposition that Australia somehow does not achieve emissions reductions that in fact our countries has. Our country has done so, in part, due to the motivation of the Australian people as well. One in four Australian households have rooftop solar, the highest rate of uptake in the world. Last year, Australia saw some seven gigawatts of renewable energy capacity installed in our country, nearly eight times faster than the global average per person. It is this momentum that we intend to continue to pursue, and it is absolutely our commitment to make sure we continue to meet and beat those targets in the future.</span>

As I said in the primary answer, the Prime Minister has already responded to the IPCC report in a press conference earlier today, and, as I outlined, the government takes seriously the challenges of addressing global climate change. We take it seriously as a government, and it's why we're investing some $20 billion on low-emissions technologies over the next decades, with $1.6 billion committed just through this 2021-22 budget. It's why, during the Prime Minister's recent visit overseas, he signed partnership agreements that now see us in partnership arrangements with Singapore, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom to deliver the low-emissions technologies that the globe needs to be able to deliver and achieve net zero emissions. The 2021-22 budget particularly dedicated $565 million to progress international research projects, knowing that those international projects of cooperation are the things that will actually deliver the technological changes to get the job done.</span>

The Australian government unequivocally condemns the armed drone attack on the civilian tanker MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercer Street</span> in waters off Oman which have been attributed to Iran. Iran's reckless, unlawful, deliberate and targeted attack on a merchant vessel is a clear violation of international law. Australia offers the sincere condolences to the families and friends of the British and Romanian citizens who were killed in this attack conducted by a drone that was filled with explosives and deliberately flown into the bridge of the tanker.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Iran's denials of responsibility for the attack are not credible. The Australian government fully supports calls for this Iranian escalation of attacks on civilian shipping to be addressed by the United Nations. Such attacks are now a lethal risk to all international merchant shipping in the region. Iran's deliberate attacks on shipping, whether by drone or any other means, must cease and those responsible for giving orders and carrying out the attacks must be held to account. That the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercer Street</span> had connections to Israel makes this act more concerning. Iran's continuing shadow war against the state of Israel breaches every foundational principle of the international community of nations and the key obligations of all member states of the United Nations. It is appropriate for the United Nations to address misconduct and its impact on regional stability and the disruption of peace.</span>

The resolve of the international community to prevent the acquisition and use of nuclear weapons has grown year on year. Today, more than ever, the global community insists on compliance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and supports the inspection and verification work of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Australian government calls on Iran to work in good faith with the parties, including to the joint comprehensive plan of action, to return to compliance with the NPT, to allow complete IAEA verification of its peaceful intentions for nuclear technology and to reverse its steps towards weapons-grade nuclear material.</span>

Hezbollah's use of villages as human shields is against international law, and in this regard the courageous actions of Lebanese civilians to stop one of the Hezbollah mobile rocket launchers from escaping is worthy of public recognition. This action resulted in the arrest of the terrorists.</span>

There are a few things that are relevant to that question. It is important that Australians be in a position to provide a form of proof of vaccination. The importance of that is likely to be the case for a number of reasons, not just medical reasons. That's why the government has been working in terms of the technology to enable people to download their vaccine certificateâ€”as part of their Apple Wallet technology platforms, for example. It's also why work is underway for high-security proof-of-vaccination linkage to passport-type documents for international travel. A number of countries of the world have made it clear already that vaccination may be an important part of, or a requirement for, entry to their nations in the future. So Australians will likely need and require that sort of technology and support to be able to demonstrate proof of vaccination as part of their travels and their engagements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of requirements in relation to vaccination in Australia and for domestic travel, some airlines themselves have indicated that they expect this to be a requirement for travel. Those are, at this stage, commercial decisions. Governments have made certain decisions in relation to certain workforces, especially those such as aged-care sectors, where public health orders could be used in relation to vaccination. Once again, having effective proof of vaccination may well be a relevant consideration for people in those workforce environments and also perhaps for those visiting aged-care facilities or the like in the future, which is why having such technology available is important.</span>

I would hope that all Australians understand, in terms of the way I have explained the likely need for technology platforms that can provide proof of vaccination, that it is a sensible thing for people to haveâ€”to, as I said, facilitate their ability to travel internationally in the future in what are likely to be changed circumstances and their ability to work in sectors where there are requirements for vaccination or to meet other potential public health requirements that states or territories may impose to continue to successfully manage COVID-19.</span>

Thank you, Senator O'Neill. I want to emphasiseâ€”because the quote suggests, perhaps, a misunderstanding that there's going to be some compulsion for people to have a vaccineâ€”that the government's always been very clear that Australians will face a choice in relation to getting vaccinated. We do urge all Australians to exercise that choice. I'm very pleased that some 234,899 Australians turned out yesterday as part of the vaccination program, pushing the number of vaccine doses administered to some 13.958 million across Australia. That is a demonstration of the momentum that is building across the rollout, which has now seen 44.7 per cent of those aged over 16 receive at least their first dose. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Australia is committed to supporting our Pacific family and is ready to respond to new challenges as part of our Pacific Step-up. Through our Partnerships for Recovery, the government has made our highest ever contribution to Pacific development in 2020-21, providing an estimated $1.7 billion to the region. Our funding is supporting the twin goals of health and economic recovery in the Pacific. The funding delivers critical financing to the Pacific and Timor-Leste to help mitigate fiscal crises, maintain essential health services, sustain aviation connectivity and protect the most vulnerable people. Our funding is providing direct financial support to Fiji's budget, which is bolstering social protection schemes for those in need. In PNG, we are supporting a new child nutrition grant, the first social protection payment of its type to be introduced. We've also restarted Pacific labour initiatives to boost economic activity and incomes for Pacific families as well as to support our farmers and industries to meet critical workforce needs. Australia has also directly facilitated the delivery of over a million vaccine dosesâ€”which will reach 1.5 million by the end of this weekâ€”and over 100 tonnes of humanitarian supplies on more than 400 Australian supported flights.</span>

Pacific labour programs are a high priority for nations in our region and, indeed, are one of Australia's highest priorities for the Pacific. Through the Pacific Labour Scheme and the Seasonal Worker Program, we're providing valuable employment opportunities to more than 14,000 Pacific and Timor-Leste workers, which are not just boosting the workers' incomes but helping to stimulate the economies of the region. These workers are meeting the critical workforce needs of hundreds of Australian businesses in a range of sectors, including horticulture, meat processing, tourism and aged care, just to name a few. </span>

Senator, it's no secret that I've been sceptical about climate change in the past. I used to think all this stuff about climate change was absolute rubbish. That was only in 2017. Since then I've listened and I've watched and I've changed my mind. I think a lot of people like me have changed their minds about climate change too, because anyone can see that the weather we're getting now is not natural. That report from the IPCC yesterday should scare the hell out of us. Senator, unless something changes, we're going to hit 1.5 degrees of warming within two decades. It is time for your government to stand up and admit that you were wrong too. Will you admit that we need to change tack here and do something very different to stop this from happening or at least slow it down?</span>

There is no doubt that the Australian government takes the issue of climate change and emissions reduction very seriously, and I'm pleased that Senator Lambie is calling for action. I can take Senator Lambie and the Senate through some of the measures that we actually are taking which demonstrate how seriously we take this issue. When Australia makes commitments to reduce emissions, unlike perhaps some other nations, we take those very seriously and we deliver on those commitments. It's not just making a commitment; it is about delivering it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Between 2005 and 2020, we reduced our emissions by 20 per cent. If we look around the world, there are many countries in the OECDâ€”in fact the average is about nine per cent, so we're about double the emissions reductions of advanced economies. If you look at the G20, about half of G20 economies have seen their emissions increase during that period. So we take that very seriously. We take seriously our investment in renewables, which, in relation to solar, is at the highest levels in the world on a per capita basis, much higher on a per capita basis than other countries.</span>

                  </a>  I do. One of the other areas we are supporting is climate resilience in the Pacific. We are doing that through significant investments of hundreds of millions of dollars. If we were to take the Greens' advice and destroy our economy tomorrow on the altar of their climate goals, we wouldn't be able to support our Pacific partners. So we're doing our bit. We're working with international partners to lower emissions to see more investment in renewables, but we'll do it in a way that is sustainable for our economy and jobs as well.</span>

Meanwhile, we've got nearly a third of the world's uranium here, but for some reason we won't use it ourselves. This government says that we can cut our emissions using technology, not taxes.

When it comes to that issueâ€”and I thank Senator Lambie for the questionâ€”Senator Lambie would be aware that there is a moratorium on nuclear generation in this country. Of course, we, as a government, believe any changes to that would require bipartisan support. There's been a blanket antinuclear stance from the Labor Party I think since the 1970s. What we've said in relation to this technology, like all technologies, is we are watching developments. Last year the Morrison government released Australia's Technology Investment Roadmap. In the road map small modular reactors are identified as a watching brief technology. There is no doubt that we need to take action in this space, but, when it comes to the issue of nuclear, we all know that, when you have a blanket ban on one side of politics and given the long lead times for this type of investment, there are significant challenges to the ability to look at that type of technology. But, when it comes to other moves, we're doing it through renewables and we're doing it through a technology-not-taxes approach, which is where we're going to be taking it into the future. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I think I largely addressed your second supplementary in the answer to your first supplementary, so I don't know that there's much I can add and there's certainly not much that I could add that would satisfy you. But what I would say is this: when it comes to taking action on climate change, reducing emissions, we always have to take a very practical real-world approach, and that is what this government has always sought to do. It is about taking the issues seriously, but it is also about recognising that, if we don't work for global action with countries right around the world, if we don't work to support existing industries, and if we don't make sure that we have strong baseload power to deliver, then our economy will go backwards, we will see jobs shed, and it will all be for noughtâ€”if we are sacrificing our economy and not actually seeing it move the dial when it comes to the environment. So we take a very responsible approach which balances all of these realities, as laid out in the earlier answers.</span>

It's important, as always, that, where programs are operated and claims have been made against the guidelines, conditions or eligibility of those programs, steps are made to recover those funds. That's the case in relation to JobKeeper, like any other program. Whilst, Senator Bilyk, you have chosen to highlight one component of the recovery activity and that is in relation to individuals who may have been in receipt of other payments, such as JobSeeker, whilst also receiving JobKeeper, it is also the case that the Australian Taxation Office has been pursuing significant instances of over-claims, over-payments or inappropriate claims with businesses. In fact, as at August, some $296.6 million has been identified by the Australian Taxation Office with Australian businesses, and the government takes very seriously recovering those funds as well. Approximately $185.5 million of those funds have been recovered to date.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, on all of these fronts, what we're assessing against is the eligibility of businesses or individuals for the payments they received according to the guidelines at the time. It shouldn't be confused at all, of course, with some of the claims people make about receipt of JobKeeper, which was entirely within the guidelines as they existed at the time. That program in particular has been identified by the Reserve Bank as having saved around 700,000 Australian jobs. It was a crucial program in terms of keeping businesses afloat during a time when, right across Australia, they were having their doors shut and, in having their doors shut, facing the proposition of having to stand down their staff. JobKeeper avoided that, and it helped to ensure that Australians kept their jobs and that our economy was in the strongest possible position for recovery.</span>

As always, we use the powers judiciously, be they for individuals or businesses, and, where possible, repayment plans are negotiated or agreed between parties.

                  </a>  I will happily take the interjection. This government will not be lectured to by those opposite on the NBN. This government delivered the NBN efficiently and economically when Australians needed it the most. In fact, today there are over 11.97 million premises ready to connect, 99 per cent of Australian premises can now order an NBN service, more than 8.2 million premises have already connected to the NBN, and 75 per cent of homes and businesses are on 50 megabits, or higher, plans. In fact, following this announcement, NBN Co will have a network of 284 business fibre zones nationally, covering over 850,000 businesses. As well as extending the business fibre zones footprint, NBN Co is further discounting its already competitive wholesale prices for business-grade broadband in order to support more business access to dedicated business-grade fibre services. New and existing businesses within business fibre zones will benefit from further wholesale pricing reductions of up to 37 per cent and, for a business already in an NBN Co business fibre zone, this morning's announcement means savings of as much as $1,800 every year. Businesses within those business fibre zones will benefit from access to NBN Co's premium business-grade product, Enterprise Ethernet, at no up-front cost, as well as CBD-equivalent pricing, irrespective of where the business is located.</span>

As I said earlier, there are now nearly 12 million premises ready to connect to the NBN. There have been 930,000 new connections in the year, with a total of 8.2 million premises now connected. This represents around a 13 per cent increase on last year. Revenue has been growing as more households and more businesses are using the NBN for high-speed broadband. And it's extremely pleasing to see that 17 per cent of premises have chosen plans from their retailer that provide download speeds of 100 megabits per second or even higher. NBN Co is now generating positive operating earnings, as measured by EBITDA, measured by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. It is in fact now $1.35 billion for the year, which is a turnaround of $2 billionâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

NBN Co is now focused on its $4.5 billion network investment plan to deliver gigabit capacity or capability on demand to 75 per cent of premises on the fixed line network as soon as 2023. In fact, by calendar-year end, the company plans to initiate a small-volume launch of fibre-to-the-node and fibre-to-the-premise upgrades, making up to 10,000 premises eligible to access the NBN Co's Home Ultrafast plan, which offers download speeds of up to one gigabit per second. It's forecast that 75 per cent of premises on the fixed line network, or around eight million premises, will be able to access the highest speed Home Ultrafast service as soon as 2023.</span>

As those in this chamber know, it is the longstanding principle of Australia's social security system that people should be paid correctly, according to their individual circumstances. The process ensures that our social security system is sustainable into the future, because it means that taxpayers only pay recipients what they're eligible forâ€”no more and no less.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the responsibility of people receiving the JobSeeker payment, or other related social security payments, to report their employment income correctly and accurately to Services Australia, and that includes if they were also receiving JobKeeper in addition to JobSeeker. Services Australia communicated widely, including through the agency websites and social media channels, to inform customers of their obligation to report JobKeeper income as income, and how it could impact the remainder of their income support. Around 79,000 individuals, identified as being at risk of incurring an overpayment as they were declaring minimal income, were contacted by Services Australia from July last yearâ€”that is, 2020. When a person is overpaid, my agencies will always write to them to let them know how much they were overpaid and explain why they owe money.</span>

If that is the case, Senator Siewert, as at 30 April this year, 11,771 customers had a debt raised after completion of their JobKeeper compliance review, which totals around $32.8 million, and this work is ongoing.

It's been very interesting. Labor have been deliberately conflating the repayment of JobKeeper payments that were due back from businesses, in terms of compliance activities, with those for individuals. The fact is, as I've just said, $296 million has been identified in overpayments to businesses, and $185 million has been recovered from businesses so far.</span>

In fact, $7.4 million of the unions' JobKeeper money went straight to the Labor Party. How about asking them about the unions and their payments that they would have received from JobKeeper?</span>

The Australian government has secured 25 million doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to further diversify our vaccine portfolio as well as to provide access to a booster variant vaccine should this be required in the future.</span>

It went to Monaco based billionaires, to men-only clubs and to the highest-fee private schools in the country. It is a shocking amount of wasteâ€”$13 billion is more than the government spent on the childcare subsidy last year. It is more than the government spent on public schools last year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">JobKeeper was supposed to go to the firms that were suffering, to support the connection between those firms and their workforces. It was never meant to go to highly profitable firms. Like so many things offered by this government, it's a good idea implemented very badly. Just reflect on what it would have meant had the Morrison government avoided this waste: it could have afforded to extend JobKeeper to the one million casual workers who missed out on any support; it could have saved additional people from losing their jobs and their livelihoods during the first wave of the pandemic; and now it would have more to spend in supporting Australians who are currently affected by lockdowns and who are struggling to pay the rent and put food on the table.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has never asked any of these recipients to pay back a single cent. He has said that calls to pay it back are 'the politics of envy'. Minister Birmingham has said that we shouldn't shame and vilify the businesses that took billions in JobKeeper while turning profits. The Morrison government continues to resist Labor's calls for transparency and accountability and refuses to crack down on businesses that won't send back payments despite turning monster profits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a strong contrast with what has been reported todayâ€”11,000 people who receive income support payments have been sent debt notices of almost $33 million. Many of these are vulnerable people who sought support during the worst health and economic crisis Australia has faced in nearly 100 years. These people shouldn't be punished. There are two stories, aren't there? There is one story for the rich and powerful and there is another story for those that aren't. But it's very on brand for this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the government that set up the robodebt scheme, and it's worth reflecting on what the Federal Court thought about the impact of that scheme on those who suffered under it. Justice Murphy said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">One thing â€¦ that stands out â€¦ is the financial hardship, anxiety and distress, including suicidal ideation and in some cases suicide, that people or their loved ones say was suffered as a result of the Robodebt system, and that many say they felt shame and hurt at being wrongly branded 'welfare cheats'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The double standard is quite breathtaking. No effort was spared to claw back money paid to some of our most vulnerable, yet no effort at all has been expended on clawing back money from big business. Indeed, the government seems pretty relaxed about handing out money to billionaire shareholders and CEOs, just as long as nobody knows about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Transparency is actually not a radical solution or idea, is it? Both the New Zealand government and the US government keep public databases of companies that receive income support, but the Morrison government is so opposed to transparency that it made clear yesterday that, if the opposition and crossbench insisted on transparency provisions, the government was willing to delay the job-keeper legislation that was debated yesterday. It really says something about this government. It says something about the Prime Minister that he is prepared to let the livelihoods of Australians on COVID support payments be collateral damage in his fight against transparency. That's an outcome Labor didn't want to risk, but we strongly believe that the public deserves to know how its money is being spent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Transparency is a basic obligation, never more important than at a time when we need our citizens to have trust in our government. That is why we will keep looking for opportunities to force the Morrison government to reveal just how much JobKeeper went to firms that actually increased their turnover during the pandemic. Australian voters deserve to know.</span>

They themselves were the ones that brought in the averaging scheme, under the Paul Keating government, in the late eighties. The member for Sydney, Tanya Plibersek, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But if people fail to come to an arrangement to settle their debts, the Government has a responsibility to taxpayers to recover that money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Maribyrnong:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The automation of this process will free up resources and result in more people being referred to the tax garnishee process, retrieving more outstanding debt on behalf of taxpayers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And from Chris Bowen, the member for McMahon, who also called for a refund of overpayments through the robodebt scheme:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">It is important that the Government explores different means of debt recovery to ensure that those who have received more money than they are entitled to repay their debt.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one is saying that the scheme is perfect and that we haven't made mistakes. We've owned up to that, but we'll never apologise for trying to automate processes in terms of the tax and transfer system in this country. When it comes to talking about subsidies for the rich, I think Labor should take a good look at themselves in the mirror. As the Treasurer pointed out yesterday, the unions themselves received $22 million in JobKeeper payments. Given the billions of dollars they collect every year from superannuation fees, they are the last people to need handouts in a time of crisis. Let's be honest. The union industry today is really nothing more than the finance-brokering arm of the industry super funds. You have to ask yourself why they aren't being taxed. I know Labor love to complain about how the coalition loves to give tax breaks to big business, but if there is a big business in this country it's the industry super funds. It's the industry super funds and their brokerage arm, the unions themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at the amount of money these guys in the unions collect by threatening to go on strike at these tier 1 builders. In Queensland, they're threatening to go on strike if it gets hotter than 30 degrees, which is a bit of a joke really. Anyone knows that it's 30 degrees in Queensland quite often after September, so I'm not quite sure when we expect to get anything built in Queensland. Good luck with that for the Olympic Games!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the other thing is the great big renewable energy subsidies that also go to the big end of town. We've got $10 billionâ€”</span>

                  </a>  I'm segueing back to the notion, which I know Senator McAllister was implying, that we're always giving tax breaks to the big end of town and we're looking after the big end of town. I'm merely pointing out, Madam Deputy President, that Labor should look in the mirror at how they look after the big end of town, whether it be unions, whether it be super funds or whether it be large corporations that get generous subsidies for energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm agnostic here. I don't think any energy company should be getting government subsidies. I know one of the big myths is that our agricultural industry, our fishing industry, our timber industry and our mining industry get free diesel subsidies. That's not true. They're actually rebatesâ€”that is, they've paid the money and they're getting back what they paid. It's neutral.</span>

                  </a>  Okay. I'm coming back to robodebt and that technology, albeit flawed. I've worked on many IT projects myself, and I can tell you that you can always take the cost of an IT project, double it and multiply it by three, because that's how much it will end up costing. I'm happy to take it on board. I would love to look at that robodebt stuff myself, because, having come from a systems implementation program, I'm sure there are ways we could fix the system. But we were trying to do the right thing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  I am always interested in listening to the coalition talk about robodebt. They never talk about the fact that they had to say sorry. They never talk about the fact that $1.8 billion was awarded to nearly 500,000 people, victims of their robodebt scheme. They never talk about the fact that the judge said it was shameful and unlawful. They never talk about any of that. They try to blame the Labor Party, when, of course, this was a scheme designed by the Morrison government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is happening now, and what happened in question time today, is that we hear in responses relating to JobKeeper the rank hypocrisy of the government when it comes to enforcement and compliance measures applied against those who are most vulnerable. The interesting thing was Senator Birmingham's response. He tried to throw back to the Labor Party: 'You just look after those who can't look after themselvesâ€”the more vulnerable.' Yes, we do! Seriously!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is quite clear in the responses we got that there are two standards here. There is one standard for big corporations that have done well from this pandemic. JobKeeper was good for people who were losing their profits. I know that. I know two companies that received JobKeeperâ€”you can have a little chuckle behind your mask over there, Senatorâ€”but they had to show that they were going backwards in profit by, from memory, about 30 per cent. So it is really interesting when you talk about the guidelines here. We've got one standard for big corporations that have done well and another for ordinary Australians struggling through the repeated lockdowns and border closures, trying to make ends meet and trying to put food on the table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's just a form of hypocrisy that we really have come to expect from the Morrison Liberal government: one rule for the rich and powerful, where you get off 'Scott-free' with taxpayer support, and when businesses have never been better, and another for the working people of Australia, who are just trying to do the right thing, faced with some of the most difficult circumstances Australians have experienced in generations, because, as we have seen highlighted in this place, this is a government more than comfortableâ€”indeed, from what it appears, overly eagerâ€”to send more than 11,000 debt notices to welfare recipients who received JobKeeper while simultaneously handing out an astonishing $13 billion in JobKeeper payments to companies that actually increased their earnings. This is what we're talking about: we're talking about companies that increased their profits. That's what we're talking about. They didn't need the JobKeeper. They increased their profits during the pandemic. Just think about thatâ€”and I really ask the senators on the other side to just think about that: $13 billion to line the pockets of businesses who didn't need the support.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, there are hundreds of thousandsâ€”most probably, millionsâ€”of Australians out there who've had their income smashed and are in desperate need of support, a great many of whom this government has ignored. Think about all the Australians who work in the gig sector: struggling, ignored by the Morrison Liberal government, while their industry was shuttered. In many, if not most, parts of the country, it's shuttered again. While the rest of the nation has to deal with cancelled shows, gigs and entertainment and sporting events that ordinarily employ hundreds of thousands of Australians, where is the support for these workers in our creative and arts industries? What about our academics and other university sector workers: denied JobKeeper; tens of thousands of them out of work because of the decisions made by this governmentâ€”decisions made by Mr Scott Morrison, a Prime Minister who turns the other cheek when millions of Australians need support, because, you know, he doesn't hold a hoseâ€”not his problem. But when it comes to corporate welfare for the most successful firms in the nation: 'Hello! Here's a cool $13 billion in cold hard cash, no questions asked. Take it!' <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I must admit I am a little bit confused and perplexedâ€”having conniptions, even. When we first talked about JobKeeper, when the Prime Minister first announced JobKeeper, those on the other side canned it: 'It'll never work. What a stupid idea.' It turns out that they were wrong. In fact, they were more than wrong. This was a revolutionary scheme. It hadn't been done anywhere around the world on the scale proposed here, and it turns out it was a wonderful scheme that saved many, many jobs and many, many businesses.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's face it: we all understandâ€”well, at least, those of us on this side understandâ€”that the vast majority of Australians who are employed in private enterprise are employed in small to medium businesses. So there's literally no point in saving jobs. You can sit someone down in a corner and you can pay them money to keep training for their job, but if they're not working for a business that job doesn't exist. You can save them and you can keep paying them and keep them ready to work, but if, in the meantime, all of those businesses that employ those workers cease to exist, then you've got nothing for them to come back to. So, despite the criticism from Labor, JobKeeper was a very, very good thing that this government brought in. I'm constantly told by businesses in the Northern Territory as I travel around: 'Thank you. It was JobKeeper that saved us. We would not be here today if it weren't for JobKeeper.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the chamber, we seem to have not gotten the crystal ball that those on the other side have, because they seem to be able to look into it and predict what's going to happen. There was doom and gloom at the start. The whole country was locked down. There were predictions of huge levels of unemployment. We thought many people would be unemployed and many businesses would go under and we would have no economy left when we finally got on top of the pandemic. We felt that on this side as well. We thought that this was going to be a tragedy and that we had to step in and do something to stop that from happening. And we did. We stood up and we got in with JobKeeper, saving those businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We couldn't predict how the pandemic would go and how the economy would respond. Some quite amazing things happened that we certainly didn't predict, that nobody predicted. I was amazed in the Northern Territory at the time of the first lockdown. Fortunately, we have only had one tiny one since. We are very lucky. But I went around talking to businesses, seeing how they innovated and managed to get through, including businesses that, in fact, thrived in the lockdown. I remember speaking to one particular business in Tennant Creek. It was a family run business and they thought that they were going to go under. But it turned out they became incredibly busy. They had a few different businesses and one of them was supplying skip bins. Who would have thought that a pandemic would create a demand for skip bins? Yet it did, because everyone was cleaning out their homes and yards and needing to dispose of things. So this business boomed. Many other businesses boomed and many have recovered and are doing really well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now they're trying to penalise us and criticising us for the fact that we did something that helped business not only survive but thrive. We now have an obligation to taxpayers to recover money that was either paid accidentally or in some cases claimed deliberately when it shouldn't have been paid. There is nothing wrong with that. We are not targeting poor people. This is across the board to anybody who received payments that they were not entitled to. There is nothing wrong with recovering funds on behalf of taxpayersâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator AYRES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:27</span>):  [by video link] Senator McMahon said at the commencement of her remarks that she was confused. That was the strongest part of her contribution and nothing that she said over the succeeding five minutes did anything to undermine her perspicacity in making that original remark. I think, in fact, the government itself is wilfully confused. It is absolutely determined to put its own interests, and the interests of its mates, ahead of the interests of the people in Australia who they should actually be looking after.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in the depths of a social, public health and economic crisis. More than half of the country is in lockdown. In some parts of the country, like here in Sydney, it's with no end in sight because of the government's failure on vaccines. In the middle of this crisis, when people are uncertain about their jobs and household incomes and fearful for the future, the Morrison government has decided to issue 11,771 of our most vulnerable Australians, the people least secure in this COVID crisis, with debt notices because of JobKeeper. These debt notices are for amounts of money that may be nothing to the people who sit on the government side of the chamberâ€”a few hundred dollars here or a few thousand dollars thereâ€”but those notices will strike absolute fear into families right across the country. It is hypocrisy. I may well be in Sydney and not in Canberra with you today, but I can smell the hypocrisy from here. You can see the absolute misallocation of priorities and you can see the absolute wilful determination of this government to look after itself and its mates rather than looking after the interests of ordinary Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrast the approach of the government in terms of compliance and going after welfare recipients with its approach on two other issues. Previous senators have pointed out that the government's approach to corporate recipients of JobKeeper is entirely different. One company, Harvey Norman, received $22 million. It recorded a $462 million profitâ€”half of that on the back of taxpayer receipts. Mr Harvey alone received $78 million. Thirty ASX companies recorded higher profits and received hundreds of millions of dollars in JobKeeper allowance, a complete misallocation of resources and prioritiesâ€”problems that were easy to foresee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrast this with the government's approach to public money when it's looking at its own interests. Every week there is another rort scheme. It was sports rortsâ€”over $100 millionâ€”where public money was misdirected away from the interests of community sports clubs to the Morrison government's own re-election prospects. There were the community development rortsâ€”hundreds of millions of dollars allocated in an entirely partisan way. There were regional rortsâ€”hundreds of millions of dollars allocated in an intensely partisan way for the government's own narrow political priorities. There were infrastructure rorts. And, of course, this week we discovered car park rorts, where the government has allocated money in an entirely partisan way and has ignored all the recommendations of the department to allocate money to marginal electorates, some of which didn't even have a railway station adjacent to the car park they were building. The money was allocated in an entirely political way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no interest in accountability for hundreds of millions of dollarsâ€”billions of dollarsâ€”misused for the Morrison government's narrow partisan interests. There's no interest in public accountability or in recovering billions of dollars that's been shovelled out the doorâ€”not to achieve its purpose of protecting people's jobs but to lift corporate profits, lift shareholder dividends and lift executive salariesâ€”and produced zero jobs in the process. This government has entirely lost its way. It has lost its capacity to act in the public interest. It's got no interest in that accountability. It just wants to put pressure on ordinary Australians who are the most vulnerable. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Superannuation, Financial Services and the Digital Economy (Senator Hume) to a question without notice asked by Senator McKim today relating to climate change policy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator McKim was asking the very important question: does the environment minister of Australia have a duty of care to our nation's children? The reason this is an important question is that right now we are confronted with some of the most damning and serious scientific facts that humanity has ever seen. We are facing catastrophic climate change, catastrophic weather events and a threat to the whole of humanity. Yet what we see from this government is a response that is glib, that is full of spin and that is more of the marketing regimes of <span style="font-style:italic;">Mad Men</span> than it is of a responsible government. And, while this is unfolding, we have right on foot an appeal to the Federal Court of Australia of our own environment minister to deny that, as a minister of the Crown, she owes a duty of care to Australia's children for the impacts of global warming and climate catastrophe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night the UN's IPCC handed down a very chilling summary of what our world faces if we do not act. It is crystal clear that this is the decade in which we need drastic action to cut carbon pollution if we are to give our planet and humanity a fighting chance. I think about the responsibilities as adults in this place, as parents, as politicians, as leaders, to not just the next generation but also today's young people when we are facing a cliff, and, if we go over, it's going to be very difficultâ€”in fact, near impossibleâ€”to return. We have to get out of fossil fuels. We have to end the expansion of coal, oil and gas and we have to transition faster than ever to renewables and clean energy sources if we are to get our climate back on track. We need to be investing in our environment and biodiversity to help Mother Nature repair herself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And all the while we have the Prime Minister spinning and spinning and spinning, pretending that he is doing everything in his powerâ€”gaslighting the entire nation; undermining the health and the safety of our children and putting at risk our economy and our trade relations across the globe. Who is the Prime Minister trying to fool? The climate is reacting because it is in trouble. The environment is in collapse because we are polluting it. Our children are demanding action because they have been taught the science, understand it and want better from our political leaders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The marketing and the spin is not going to get us out of this crisis. What we need are deep cuts to carbon pollution, and we need them now. Current policies have us on track for a four-degree warming of our planet. That is a catastrophe. We are running out of time. If we don't turn this ship around, we will face even more severe bushfires, more severe flood events, and more severe weather, famine, drought and disease. That is why we owe our children a duty of careâ€”because we have been warned. We can't pretend we don't know. Having a nice, pithy line in a press conference from the leader of the nation does nothing to help reduce the pollution and put our climate back on track. Australia needs to get with the program. Our Prime Minister needs to read the science. His government need to stop the denial and stop the delay. They owe our children a duty of care.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">A fundamental benefit of private health insurance is that consumers can choose which health practitioner they see.

                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am introducing the <span style="font-style:italic;">Human Rights (Targeted Sanctions) Bill 2021</span> to provide a framework for referrals to the Minister, requiring a response as to whether the Minister will impose targeted sanctions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I want to start by noting that the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade tabled its report on Magnitsky legislation in December 2020. That report was titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Criminality, corruption and impunity: Should Australia join the Global Magnitsky movement?</span> It followed extensive evidence provided to the Committee, from human rights organisations here in Australia and around the world, and a number of notable individuals including Bill Browder, Garry Kasparov, Amal Clooney and Geoffrey Robertson, and many others who gave their time, expertise, and in some cases gave evidence confidentially because of the personal risk to themselves. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The joint standing committee report was a unanimous, cross-partisan report, supporting Magnitsky legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's been more than half a year since the Government received that report. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In May, Senator Kitching cosponsored a motion with me, to require a response from the Government to that report. The initial response to that first order for the production of documents, when it was tabled, was very disappointing. Just a letter, saying that "The Government is still considering the 33 recommendations", and therefore they couldn't provide a response. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It was only after I lodged a second notice of motion, to require a response from the Government to that report, that we saw a response from the Government. Not actual legislation, but at least a formal response to the report. When we see legislation, we will of course scrutinise that closely, but we welcome that small step forward. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I note particularly, however, that the Government did not agree to Recommendation 12 of the report, "that an independent advisory body be constituted to receive nominations for sanctions targets, consider them and make recommendations to the decision maker". That is an important gap, and one that goes directly to the basis for this bill. I also note that Government has also not agreed to recommendations 13 or 14 that recommended the independent body be able to hold public hearings, and the Minister be required to respond to recommendations from the independent body. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So let me be very clear - the Australian Greens want to see the introduction of an appropriate Magnitsky framework, with a bill that we can appropriately scrutinise and debate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Given it took the government 8 months to respond to the Committee's unanimous cross partisan consensus report, I am not holding my breath for when we will see a proposed bill, and from the government's response on 5 August for that bill to be as comprehensive as is required and to fully reflect the consensus recommendations of the Committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So, in the absence of that bill I introduce this bill to create a framework for referrals, or as the Committee report describes them, nominations. While we wait for the bill to implement the proposed changes in the Government's response, the Australian Government does have the power to introduce sanctions under current legislation. As the Joint Standing Committee's report noted: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">There is provision within the current Australian autonomous sanctions regime to sanction individuals on the basis of human rights abuses. Similarly to Magnitsky-style Acts in the United States and Canada, the Act and Regulations allow for a person to be listed for financial sanctions and travel bans for human rights violations â€¦ </span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are of course very conscious of the extensive evidence the Committee received, about the shortfalls in the current regime. We agree with many of those critiques - we would prefer to see a full Magnitsky act, that is framed to target human rights abusers. However, while we are waiting for the Australian Government to act, tragically, human rights abuses are continuing to occur in countries around the world, and the Australian Government has tools available in the current sanctions framework which it is not using. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I noted earlier recommendations 12-14 of the report, which recommend establishing an independent advisory body. We would like to see a full Magnitsky bill, including provisions to establish an advisory body, that could be debated and considered appropriately in this chamber. Failing that, however, this Bill goes part-way to addressing that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is a provisional measure that uses the core Magnitsky principles, leveraging the current legal regime in Australia until there's a more comprehensive, stand-alone, Magnitsky. As an interim step, this bill creates a referral framework - so that where a number of Parliamentary bodies, as set out in the bill, pass a resolution in relation to a particular human rights abuser or a person responsible for serious corruption, then the Minister will be required to provide a statement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The approach in this Bill is intended to mirror that used in the United States framework, which has been summarised by the Congressional Research Service:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">â€¦ Section 1263(d), requires the President to respond within 120 days to requests from the aforementioned committee leadership to determine whether a foreign person has engaged in sanctionable activity under the law and whether or not the President intends to impose sanctions. </span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Let me be very clear, that the power to impose sanctions would still sit with the Foreign Minister. This bill does not in any way change that. What it would simply require is a statement from the Foreign Minister, as to whether the Government will impose sanctions or not. We think a nomination process from Parliamentary bodies is entirely reasonable. If the government would prefer a nomination process from an independent body, established by legislation, we would be very open to considering that; and have been disappointed to see that idea rejected in the Government's response to the report. Additionally, a number of process constraints make it simpler to adopt a nomination process from Parliamentary bodies in this bill, and we think it is a reasonable step. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill explicitly includes a review, by the Joint Standing Committee for Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade, once we actually have a legislated Magnitsky framework. That will provide an opportunity to examine whether the approach outlined in this bill is still an appropriate nomination framework, or whether it has been superseded. But until that happens, we think it is an appropriate step. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is also a very important reminder that the Foreign Minister has powers, under the current framework, to impose targeted sanctions against human rights abusers. That is something that the Myanmar diaspora community has been calling for since the coup started. There have been equivocal statements from the Department and the Minister on this issue, over time, and a range of public debate. I want to particularly note the letter from civil society organisations in Myanmar, responding to the statement that targeted sanctions would not improve the situation on the ground. The letter stated: </span>

                    <span style="font-style:italic;">'</span>
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">s assessment that additional sanctions on Myanmar would not have a positive impact on the ground â€¦ </span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">We strongly call for Australia and the international community to take action against these criminals through targeted sanctions and other appropriate measures. </span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is a reminder of how important this issue is, and how long the Australian Government has already delayed action. According to the UN's Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar (27 July 2021):</span>

Another 255 people have been sentenced for trumped up crimes, with 26 of them - two of whom are minors - sentenced to death. According to the UNHCR, there are 570,320 internally displaced persons currently living in Rakhine, Chin, Kachin, Shan, Kayin, Mon, and Bago states. </span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Junta forces have engaged in at least 260 attacks against medical personnel and facilities, claiming the lives of at least 18 people. Over 600 health care professionals are currently eluding outstanding arrest warrants and at least 67 are being held by junta forces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Despite this horrific situation, the Australian Government has refused to act, in contrast to many countries around the world. As the Australian Council for International Development summarised: "Together, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and the European Union have imposed sanctions on a total of 38 individuals and 17 entities associated with the junta." </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So the Bill explicitly includes a clause requiring an urgent statement from the Foreign Minister, as to whether the Australian Government will impose targeted sanctions against individuals who have been responsible for, or complicit in, the coup in Myanmar. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, it poses a risk to humanity. As was commented yesterday by the IPCC and the UN Secretary-General, this is a code red for humanity. For some of us, we have been saying this and urging for action and campaigning for action for years. I personally have been campaigning for this for over 32 years with basically the same message: climate change is coming. Climate change is happening. We risk everything on our planet through our inaction on the threat of climate change, and now we are facing the reality. There are bushfires around Australia, bushfires in northern Europe, bushfires in northern America. Floods and lots of rainfall: that's been happening in my home state in Western Australia, in the south-west of WA, for decades. You can see it step down, yet what happens? There's no action. This should be a time when this place comes together and shows leadership in the face of this massive crisis, the catastrophe that we face. As a species we have threatened every species on this planet. It's not just about us, folks. This is about every species on this planet.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The IPCC's sixth assessment report is clear: climate change is widespread, rapid and intensifying. Climate change and its impacts are accelerating across the planet. Unless we make immediate and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees will be beyond our reach. That goal is fast disappearing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report sets out five new emissions scenarios illustrating possible climate futures. It paints a terrifying picture for Australia, one that we have been warned about for years. The intensity, frequency and duration of fire weather is projected to increase throughout Australia. As global temperatures rise from 1.5 degrees to two degrees and beyond, heatwaves, floods and other extreme events will become more widespread. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If that hadn't broken my heart already, my heart would have broken when I learned about what's going to happen to our oceans. There will be a further increase in marine heatwaves and ocean acidity in Australia. This poses severe challenges for our beautiful, world-renowned marine ecosystems, including precious places like Ningaloo and Shark Bay, places that we in Western Australia hold dear to our hearts. Scientists are virtually certain that global mean sea level will continue to rise over the 21st century. Even under the most ambitious cuts to emissions, the world's oceans will probably rise between 28 and 55 centimetres, but, if emissions remain very high, seas will rise between 63 andâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The motion today warns of more intense heatwaves, fires, droughts and floods, but I can tell you now that what we are going to see more of is the despicable behaviour that we saw out the front of this building this morning. We're going to see more of this vandalism, criminal behaviour and terrorismâ€”yes, terrorism, because what these people are doing is terrorising employees who are just going about their daily jobs, doing their work. They do not expect to be confronted by people bearing cans of paint and buckets of goodness knows what, supergluing themselves all over the placeâ€”with glue made by the oil and gas industry, by the way. These people should not have to expect to have this sort of terrorism perpetrated at their workplace. We saw it not just today but last week at the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources. We saw employees going about their daily workâ€”working for the people of Australia, working for the governmentâ€”being terrorised by these despicable bunches of people.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's important that we play our part in addressing all types of pollution, whether it's emissions or plastics. There's a whole range of factors that are affecting our environment. We must play our part. But, throughout history, the temperature of the earth has been dictated by sunspot activity. We have no control over sunspot activity. There has been the medieval warm period, where the earth warmed. There have been ice ages, and, in fact, a lot of scientists predict currently that we are heading into a period of low sunspot activity. That doesn't take away from our obligation to play our part, but it is certainly not the case that the temperature of the earth is completely controlled by carbon emissions. That is a falsehood. That is not a fact.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are serious about lowering our emissions and if we are really serious about Australia meeting and exceeding our targets, lowering our emissions and still having reliable, affordable, dispatchable energy, then I refer to Senator Lambie's question during question time: why are we not looking at nuclear power? This has to be a consideration in our energy mix if we are to meet our targets and not destroy our economy and our way of life. If we look at the developed nations around the world that have low emissionsâ€”countries in Europe, the UK and Americaâ€”they all have nuclear power as part of their energy mix. In fact, all of the developed countries that have low-emissions footprints have either nuclear power in their energy mix or access to large hydro schemes. So I would say that, if we are serious about meeting and exceeding our targets, we should be looking at nuclear power: Canada, 15 per cent; the UK and America, 20 per cent. We have an abundance of fuel here in Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="ING" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLAGHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  In a way, Senator McMahon's contribution highlights again the failure of all of us, really, to work out a way forward on how we deal with the issues that are raised in the IPCC report. It is with some sadness and despair, actually, that I have to give a speech today trying to argue about the need for change and the need to address climate change. This is the sixth report based on the science that clearly makes the case for the urgent need for change. Yet here we are in this placeâ€”leaders. All of us here were elected to do a job, and we still can't agree on the way forward. That has been the problem that has plagued this parliament for more than a decade. Meanwhile, the science keeps coming in and the evidence keeps coming in. Every summer, we see the bushfires get worse. Every winter, we watch the fires in the Northern Hemisphere get worse. We see the floods and the natural disasters that come and hit our shores. We see the plight of people in the Pacific. It's commonly understood. Even the ACT resident climate-change denier todayâ€”now with ministerial responsibilityâ€”kind of acknowledges that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the world that our children are growing up in, including my children, who had to remain inside because the smoke was so thick in the ACT. We had the worst air pollution anywhere in the world, about two years ago, from the fires that were all around our borders. This is the world that my children are growing up in. They get it. The overwhelming majority of young people get it, because they see it and they've got a stake in what happens. Yet, here we are, the leaders of the country in a political sense, and we're still working out what to do, whether to convince each other and pointing the finger. It's just devastating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I used to believe in good policy being made in chambers like this. That's why I got into politics: to make a difference, to be part of the debate. I used to believe that governments could bring people together, that they could show leadership and could, when they reach across the aisle and bring stakeholders together, make good policy in the national interest. Yet, for the past eight years, I've watched the politics of climate change get kicked around, weaponised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There now seems to be, from the government's point of view, a moratorium on good policy. They're not even interested, because it's about power; it's not about policy. It's not about the future. It's not about making sure the decisions we make today give us a fighting chance of making sure that our kids and our grandkids don't inherit a dying planet. It's not about that anymore; it's about power. It's about dealing with division and disagreement from within the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time Labor has said, 'We will support you on this policy,' on one of the many different policies you've tried to get upâ€”let's pick the one that you used before you necked Malcom Turnbullâ€”when we reach across the chamber, even when it's not what we would have done, but it's a step in the right direction, what's the response? You get rid of the Prime Minister and completely walk away from it, and another two or three years is lost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, we get these reports that tell us we've got to act and if we don't act it's going to be a disaster. Then the government just trots out its three dot points that it's been using for the past few years: one, our emissions have gone down; two, Australia beat its 2020 targetsâ€”I think the language is 'meet and beat'â€”and three, we're committed to Paris and we have a flimsy commitment to 2050 as soon as possible or preferable. That's the only answer we've got. Surely we're better than this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to convince people from here. I get that not everybody across Australia agrees with where the Greens are. A lot of people don't; the majority don't. So lecturing from that side doesn't work. There has to be somewhere in the centre where people from your side and our side and their side can find some common place to deal with the disaster that this report clearly shows will happen if we don't do more. That's what the community expects from us: to engage with those who don't believe, to understand their worries. I get that there are people worried about their economic future and what it means for them, for their job, for their kid's job, for their livelihood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Change is hard; leading change is hard. Being in government is hard. I get all that. But someone has to lead, and people expect the elected government of the day to lead, not to point the finger at everybody else and use slogans like 'technology not taxes' and keep saying it and saying it and hoping that this is the message that gets through but to go deeper, convince people, talk to people, tell them what it's going to be like in their region when climate change, as outlined in this report, lands on their doorstep.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the people in power now don't care. They'll be gone. It won't be Scott Morrison answering to people as fires and flood and drought change the way we live. It won't be him answering to that. It will be some other person, probably not in the parliament yet, who'll be faced with explaining why there was a decade of lost opportunity from this government. It will be up to that person to explain to generations why the changes that are brought in then are going to be harder, their lives are going to be harder and livelihoods are going to be harder because we didn't take the message seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want to have to listen to another government member saying: 'We take this seriously. We are acting.' It's a load of rubbish. It's absolute rubbish. They're working out how to stay in power. That is a disgrace, when this is one of the biggest issues facing this country. You can pretend all you like that it's not coming, but the history books will show we were warned and we should have done something more. It won't reflect well on this government, not that I think that will matter to them. I don't think it does. It probably won't matter to Senator Roberts either, who is smiling through this presentation. But it matters to people who want good policy in this country, who want to make sure that future generations have jobs, livelihoods, that can compete in a global world. That matters. It matters to me that my kids and their kids think that this generation tried to do something, or more than tried and actually did something. That's what motivates people to actually call for serious action on climate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This report is damning. It is scary. I know people will try to pass it off and say: 'It's just another report. It's not true.' I'm sure we'll have a presentation like that from Senator Roberts soon. But the reports have been right so far. Anyone who has watched the floods, fires and other natural disasters criss-crossing between the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere knows it's true. We should be better. We should be able to do something. We should be able to work together to do it. It might not be exactly what we want, but we should do something more. It should move beyond slogans of power and into actually doing the job that we've been elected to do, which is to look after not only people now but also generations in the future. That's the big failure of this government today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  This is not a matter of urgency. Even the Greens' motion says the temperature 'could' reach 1.5 degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels. So what? It does not say anywhere in that report, from what I've been toldâ€”and I will be reading itâ€”that it will. Senator Gallagher is completely wrong. This is not an emergency and not a matter of urgency. The report does not show what will happen. It says what could happen. There is no empirical scientific evidence that backs this up. Science is decided not by emotions or whims or daughters saying, 'There's smoke in the air, Mummy; that must be climate change.' That's not it. It's not decided by Senator Watt and Senator Wong having an all-out battle with the Greens this morning. Not once did anyone talk about the science. Not once did that happen. Instead they were talking about each other and who was going to get their votes off the climate alarmists. That's it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are now at day 701, almost two years, since I challenged Senator Waters and Senator Di Natale in this place to provide the empirical scientific evidence that shows that carbon dioxide from human activity affects the climate and needs to be cut. I also challenged them at the same time, 701 days ago, to debate me on the science behind the climate alarm and also the corruption of climate science. Not once since has Senator Waters presented any such evidence proving causation of human induced climate change. I also challenged her almost 11 years ago in public. I've never seen a person move so quickly. She jumped to her feet and said, 'I will not debate you.' Why? It's because, like Extinction Rebellion damaging this parliament, the Greens are just spouting out emotion, fluff and nonsense. But it's emotion riddled nonsense. That's what gets people in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the facts. I've challenged the CSIRO to provide me facts. Firstly, over the course of three presentations, the CSIRO have admitted that they never said that carbon dioxide from human activity is a danger.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, they admitted that today's temperatures are not unprecedented. 'Not unprecedented'; it's happened before. In fact, they've been four degrees warmer before. We're not worried about 1.5 degrees. One point five degrees would be beneficial to the planet and to human society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the CSIRO cited papers that do not show the rate of temperature rise is unprecedented. When they couldn't prove that the temperature was unprecedented, they said the rate of temperature rise is. We've gone 26 years without any increase in temperatureâ€”just normal cycles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourthly, the CSIRO relies not on science, on data, but on unvalidated models giving erroneous projections, the same as the IPCC that Senator Gallagher was referring to. The CSIROâ€”and this is the clincherâ€”have never quantified any specific impact from human carbon dioxide on climate. They have never quantified it. They can't tell us what our carbon dioxide will do. But we've blown on our power bills a staggering $13 billion a year in additional costs, on subsidies, for climate change and so-called renewables. That is $1,300 per household. That is what is staggering. That is the catastrophe that's looming in this country because of the gutless Liberal-Nationals, the dishonest Labor Party and the insane Greens. That's the crisis we're facing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  I note colleagues like Senator McMahon who have raised in this place today the unlawful protests and desecration of our national parliament by criminals earlier today. I also note the shamefully vocal defence of those criminals mounted by the Greens in this very chamber. In fact, it almost leads me to channel Peter Costello in asking: 'How do the Greens sleep while their prams are burning?' This is a government that can walk and chew gum at the same time. Not only are we taking meaningful action on the very real challenge of emissions reductionâ€”which I'll get to in timeâ€”but we've also undertaken very significant reforms, important reforms, to the Australian charities and not-for-profit sector to ensure that no organisation that hides behind the tax deductions and the legitimacy of the charitable status afforded to it undertakes and resources the sorts of profoundly illegal and offensive behaviour that those Greens over there support in this place today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also heard criticism from the Labor Party today. Somehow, achieving emissions reductions in real termsâ€”such that our emissions today are lower than they were in 1990â€”achieving emissions reductions of 20 per cent on 2005 levels and beating Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and South Africa in achieving emissions reductions since 2005 aren't enough for them. It would seem that the only things they're looking for are job-destroying taxes, blank cheques and meaningless international commitments. Well, this is a government that won't stand for that. We stand for ambitious action on climate change, but only where it can be met and supported by a clear plan, a costed plan and one that supports Australian jobs. That's why the Morrison government stands proudly behind its technology road map that supports a lower-carbon-intensity future, not only for the Australian economy but also for the rest of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that climate change and emissions reduction are a global problem. The developing world accounts for more than two-thirds of carbon emissions, and China alone accounts for more emissions than all of the OECD economies combined. That is to say that reducing Australia's 1.1 per cent contribution to global emissions can't, of itself, solve this problem. But we have a very legitimate place at the global table when these matters are discussed, because of our impressive track record of actual emissions reductions and because of our ambition to reach net zero as soon as possible and preferably by 2050.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a powerful message and one that resonates with the Australian peopleâ€”the Australian people who enjoy jobs in the resources sector, who enjoy jobs in advanced manufacturing and who see opportunities that loom on the horizon as this government makes investments in things like hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, electric vehicle infrastructure and heavy vehicle efficiencies, which those opposite joined up with the Greens to vote against. Just six weeks ago in this very chamber, those opposite voted against a $192.5 million investment in renewable technologies. That exposes the hypocrisy and the baseless lies that are trotted out each day. They contrast most starkly with the actions of a government that has achieved not only real emissions reduction but such a significant level of emissions reduction that we stand proudly at the forefront of the global effort on this issue.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>): For anyone who takes the time to look at the IPCC report released yesterday, it is genuinely concerning reading. In some respects it simply repeats things that we have known for some timeâ€”that we do face an extremely big challenge around climate changeâ€”but it is brought into stark relief when you look at the data and the evidence that that report presents. In particular, the evidence in this report regarding the likely impact of climate change on our regions makes for very stark reading.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if you just look at what it has to say about northern Australia, one of the regions, anyone who cares about the future of northern Australia should really have pause for thought and should really be committing themselves to taking action. I will note just a couple of things that the report has to say about northern Australia. It observes that northern Australia has already seen a rise in annual rainfall and heavy rain events and that the region will face heavier rainfall in future. The report states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Heavy rainfall and river floods are projected to increase in Australia in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has similar things to say about sea levels, coastal flooding, seashore erosion, bushfires and cyclones as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very clear from this report that it is our regions in particular which will bear the brunt of our failure collectively as a nation to take action on climate change. Every LNP politician who likes to come in here and bang on about how much they care about the regions is actually betraying the regions. They are betraying regional Australians through their continued refusal to take action on climate change. When we see bushfires, they don't happen in the Sydney CBD and, when we see cyclones, they don't happen in the Melbourne CBDâ€”they don't happen on Collins Street; they happen in regional Australia. Bushfires, cyclones and floods overwhelmingly happen in regional Australia. It's our regions that are on the front line when it comes to the effects of climate change, and it is our regions who are being so grossly let down by a government that pretends to be on their side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the government doing to protect our regions from climate change? Well, the answer, as with so many other things, is nothing. This is a government, this is a Prime Minister, that never takes responsibility whether it be for COVID, whether it be for bushfires through the black summer or whether it be now, when we face this big climate change challenge. It's a government that is always slow to act. We saw the Prime Minister ignore repeatedly warnings and requests for meetings from fire chiefs before the black summer bushfires. All they wanted to do was warn him about the risks and encourage him to take action. He ignored them and refused to meet them, and we saw the devastating effects afterwards from this Prime Minister failing to take responsibility, failing to lead the nation and being so slow to act. This government's ongoing ignorance of the risk of climate change and ongoing refusal to take action on climate change are literally putting Australians at risk, especially in regional Australia. At the same time, the government's refusal to take action on climate change is denying regional Australians opportunitiesâ€”because there are opportunities that come for our regions if we take serious action on climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are already seeing businesses around regional Australia come to grips with the challenge, adjust and, in fact, make money and create jobs out of this. Not that long ago I was at the Sun Metals Zinc Refinery in Townsville, one of the biggest energy users in Queensland, which is already progressively moving its power sources to solar and is on track to convert to carbon-neutral power in the next couple of decades. This is happening now. Companies are creating jobs in regional Australia by making this adjustment now. It's why groups like the National Farmers Federation are on board with net zero emissions. It's why Rio Tinto, BHP, Santos, Origin and every big energy producer and consumer in the country is on board. The only group that isn't on board is this government. This government, because it doesn't take action on climate change, is chasing jobs out of regional Australia and into other countries' arms. I want to see these jobs created in places like Gladstone. I want to see them created in Rocky, Townsville, Darwin and Cairns. I don't want to see them created overseas. But we need a government that is prepared to take action on climate change and grasp this opportunity.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  [by video link] It's a 'code red for humanity'. That's what the United Nations has called the IPCC's latest warning on climate. The world is heating faster. We're closer than ever to catastrophic change, and, once we hit the tipping point, the climate dominoes will fall, threatening our very existence. The new IPCC report is our starkest warning yet, but the Prime Minister's lack of action on the climate emergency heralds a death sentence for our lands, our forests, our rivers, our oceans and our animals. There is literally not a second left to waste. It's not too late. If we heed the warning and take urgent action, we can still avoid the worst impacts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report does make for grim reading, though. It warns that catastrophic floods and fires we are already living through will become the norm, heavy rainfall and river floods are projected to worsen across Australasia, and the intensity, frequency and duration of bushfires will increase throughout Australia. Experts say that Australia needs to reduce its emissions by 75 per cent by 2030 to avoid irreversible climate change. So, at this time of climate collapse, where are Mr Morrison and his government? They are busily fudging numbers and misleading people about our emissions. They are lobbying to override scientists at UNESCO who recommend the Great Barrier Reef be listed as endangered. They are doing dirty deals to dig up more dirty coal and gas with public money. You are the criminals, not the activists trying to save the planet and pushing you to take responsibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And while the Liberals are burning through Australia's carbon budget at the risk of catastrophic climate damage, Labor is giving up on the climate action needed and is letting them off the hook. The alarm bells are ringing, yet both major parties have decided to look away. They've sold out to their pals and donors in the fossil fuel industry. What a victory for the coal, oil and gas corporations in their race to stockpile profits while the planet burns! Being slaves to the coal barons is turning all our futures into ash. Millions of lives depend on our response to the climate crisis. Generations across the world will be deprived of the opportunity to live a dignified life if we don't act. You are stealing their future from right in front of their eyes, and they will have to live with the wretched reality of your inaction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Morrison and co are perpetrating an intergenerational theft so enormous that it wouldn't be believable were we not witnessing it with our very own eyes. If there's no action, the report warns, we will hit 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming by 2030. Our forests will burn, sea levels will rise, rivers will dry up and also flood, and our wildlife will suffer. Who has forgotten our last summer when deadly and tragic bushfires in our own backyard ravaged our forests and wildlife and consumed lives? These climate disasters will only intensify as the earth continues to heat up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can barely contain my anger when I say that we are sick of you, Mr Morrison. We are sick of your drivel. We are sick of your inaction. Do something, Prime Ministerâ€”literally anythingâ€”to turn back the clock on your criminal inaction. But you won't, so you and your lot need to be kicked out. Having the Greens in shared power is the only way we'll get emergency action on the climate crisis.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  Now, theirs is a party that clings to the idea of globalisation, with open borders or no borders at allâ€”just opening up all the countries across the world, or one world, or whatever it is that you believe, out on the fringes. They love to say that Australia should open up to whoever wants to come, whenever they want to come, with no need to embrace our Australian cultureâ€”in fact, they openly and actively talk Australians down. But, when it comes to climate change and the discussion around that, Australia can do it all and there's no need for any global response or participation by any other nation. There's no need for the rest of the world to participate at all! So they sit idly byâ€”and perhaps it's because they've been superglued to something!â€”as their ideologically aligned China continues to build more and more coal-fired power stations. But perhaps Communist emissions don't count when it comes to this lot! I just don't see what other reason there could be.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's the thing, though. I'll let you in on a little secret. If we, as a globe, are going to tackle global emissions, it needs to be a global effort. I know that sounds crazy and way out there and just a little bit too much for you all to handle, but half of the G20 member nations actually increased their emissions whilst Australia's fell faster than those of Canada, New Zealand, Japan, Korea or the United States. Yet, here we are, as you can contribute hot air, and pretty much that's it, to this current conversation.</span>

When asked about this, all the current Leader of the Opposition could musterâ€”and I do hope that I do this justiceâ€”was: 'Well, what we do is, in government, of course, what we're doing is that we're encouraging the current government.' I mean, um, thanksâ€”I think! It seems to be hot air, indecision, paralysis and the beating of the leadership drum. I guess that, in part, could explain why, just last week, those opposite voted against the Technology Investment Roadmap. They voted against technology, because we know that, for those opposite, it's purely about taxes and nothing else.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not for us, on this side of the chamber; we're here for technology. We're looking to the futureâ€”investing in innovation; investing in our regions. I've personally been thrilled to see the $20 billion that's been invested by the Morrison government across the country up to 2030, and this $20 billion over the next decade will drive $80 billion of total public and private investment over the decade. This investment will create around 160,000 new jobs. But yes, sureâ€”you guys over on the other side, you just keep on voting against those jobs! And keep on voting against the jobs of those workers in the Hunter region, as you walk away from the miners, but, on top of that, walk away from the energy hub that the Hunter region is becomingâ€”all as you continue to march to the drum of the inner city latte left. Not us, on this side; we are looking at technology, not taxes; not destroying jobs or imposing taxes and new costs on households, businesses or industries.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, in the Hunter, we have organisations like Batt Mobile and Energy Renaissance, as the region moves towards becoming a hydrogen hub, with partnerships between industry and the University of Newcastle. So I thought I might take the time to explain to you what some of this investment looks like and what some of this innovation looks like, because I'm not quite sure the intellectual fortitude and the depth of understanding exist for you to understand how some of these things look.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Chair. I apologise. I will just explain a few things around some of the innovations that we have invested in. We all know that Australia's resources sector is world class. And through the Morrison government's $1.3 billion Modern Manufacturing Initiative we're actually helping to unlock enormous potential by providing targeted supports for projects that would deliver big rewards for local economies, not only creating more jobs but also generating export opportunities. In July we announced a grant of $4Â½ million for Batt Mobile Equipment in the Hunter to build heavy battery electric vehicles for underground hard-rock mines. This will deliver Australia's first commercially operationally viable alternative to a diesel fleet. It will catalyse the electrification of global hard-rock mines and deliver emissions reduction as well as safety and productivity outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my favourite organisations that's showing itself to be so innovative throughout the Hunter region is a company called Energy Renaissance. They've been working some great partnerships with the CSIRO, amongst others. They're demonstrating that here in Australia we have all the right skills, natural resources and expertise, and an abundance of solar energy, to create batteries and a renewables manufacturing hub. We know that the economic impact of COVID has created a greater urgency to build industries, create jobs and accelerate our economic recovery, and Energy Renaissance has seen this opportunity for battery manufacturing to take the lead in this. They're building an exciting future where the world is powered by clean, stored energy everywhere, and they're building it right here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 2017 Energy Renaissance announced that they would develop Australia's first advanced lithium iron battery manufacturing facility, with funding from private investors and their foundation customers. They're continuing to work with the CSIRO and technology partner Cadenza Innovation as they ramp up their capabilities and capacity to manufacture batteries in Australia that are safe, affordable and optimised to perform in hot climates. The company's supercell and superstorage family of products are designed to perform in hot climates and to be used to power infrastructure, buildings, businesses and homes in both stationary and transport applications. I was absolutely thrilled to visit the site twice this year, including turning the first sod of what will be the lithium iron battery manufacturing centre. This scale and the anticipated market will see their export opportunities grow to an estimated contribution of around $3 billion per annum once our battery market is up and exporting across the world.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hydrogen hubs are something else the Morrison government is focused on. For those who don't understand, hydrogen is actually a zero-emissions gas. Yet when we wanted to invest in the technology road map and we wanted to look at technology, not taxes, those opposite were more upset about hydrogen, I think, than they were about coal. I just don't understand what's wrong with you people. We know you don't like nuclear and won't put it back on the table at allâ€”</span>

                  </a>  Those opposite aren't very focused on looking at actual zero-emissions forms of technology, including things like nuclear. The ideological opposition of those opposite is longstandingâ€”it's nice to see that something in their value proposition is longstanding. There is a continued opposition to hydrogen hubs and net-zero-emissions gas, an opportunity for the regions to develop jobs where we have plenty of natural resources. In fact, the great thing about hydrogen is that it can actually contribute to our waste reduction. There's another company up in the Hunter that is looking to burn excess timber productsâ€”waste timberâ€”and create a hydrogen hub and generate more and more energy for that region. It's nice to think that from those opposite we at least have one member, the member for Hunterâ€”Mr Fitzgibbon, out there on his own. He must be just thrilled, listening to Senator Faruqi talking about a shared power arrangement. I can't wait to catch up with the member for Hunter for that one! I might have to expedite that membership form to him sooner rather than later. I think he's the only one opposite who still understands that mining has a future in this country. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:49</span>):  [by video link] The sixth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is very clear. It's clear about the impact that years of Liberal-National government inaction on climate policy is having on Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the IPCC, Australia has already warmed by 1.4 degrees Celsius since 1910. Heat extremes have increased and cold extremes have decreased, and these trends are projected to continue. The frequency of extreme fire weather days has increased and the fire season has become longer in many, many locations around this country and around the world. The intensity, frequency and duration of fire weather events are projected to increase throughout Australia. And, of course, we're already seeing the consequences of inaction on climate. We lived through the black summer bushfires, which ravaged so much of New South Wales and other parts of Australia. Months before the black summer bushfires, a group of 23 former fire chiefs and other emergency services leaders tried to meet with the Prime Minister to raise their concerns. Mr Morrison refused to meet with them. Then, as Australia burned, Mr Morrison went on holiday to Hawaii. As the bushfires continued to ravage Australia, he was finally forced to cut his holiday short. When he did return, he griped that he 'doesn't hold a hose, mate'. The verdict is in. The failure of the Morrison government and the Liberal-National governments before it to take any action have condemned Australia to future bushfire seasons like the 'black summer'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a great shame because, as the world moves rapidly towards renewable energy, we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Australia to jump ahead of the pack. Australia's abundant natural resourcesâ€”wind, solar, hydrogen and gasâ€”represent an incredible additional export opportunity for the Australian economy. A federal government which actually backs our local energy sector with investment and policy certainty could create thousands of good-paying jobs, while making power cheaper for homes and businesses alike. Instead, we have the absurd situation, as the Australian Workers Union has highlighted, where Australians are paying more for our own gas than we charge customers overseas. This is the energy policy legacy of the Morrison government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia needs a government that gives the energy sector the policy certainty to invest. After eight years of Liberal government, we still don't know what their 2050 target is. Every state and territory government, Labor and Liberal alike, and all leading businesses, industry and agriculture groups are united in committing to net zero by at least 2050. The only major organisation left in Australia opposing this position is the Morrison government. Without a target, the Morrison government does not have a plan. It is just floundering around. They don't have any answers for coalmining workers, either. The Morrison government dares to pretend that it's looking out for them while it comes to Canberra to pass legislation to support labour hire firms that are driving down the pay and conditions of mine workers. And the Morrison government spends $300,000 supporting WorkPac in the High Court in a case against one of their exploited casual employees. The truth is that the Morrison government is not on the side of mine workers; Mr Morrison and the rest of this sorry government are only here to represent themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that the world's climate emergency is Australia's job opportunity. Renewables jobs are important to us. It's important to us to make sure that they work, because, quite clearly, we have an opportunity to turn around and engage nearly 27,000 extra workersâ€”and an expected 45,000 by the year 2035â€”yet the Liberal-National government has failed to give rights to those workers. One of the reports talks about sharing the benefits with workers. We're not getting lower energy prices, and workers aren't getting the benefit. The report talks about the fact that these jobs are insecure jobs because of the way that they're arranged under this government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This report is crystal clear. It may be inconvenient to the major parties in this place, who are funded by the perpetrators of the climate crisis. It may be inconvenient to face the reality that the people who fund your campaign are destroying our planet. It may be inconvenient that the question before the Labor and Liberal parties is whether they value the donations which drive their campaigns more than they value the lives and futures of the young people of this nation. Nevertheless, that is the truth laid bare by this report.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This report is a signpost at a crossroads, presenting us with a clear choice. It shows us very clearly that the climate crisis which we are now enduring is a creation of politicsâ€”a political creation with a political solution. The choice is to invest in renewable energy, keep coal in the ground, keep gas in the ground, create jobs in the transition to renewables or to continue doing what you have doing now: selling out our future in favour of donations from the gas giantsâ€”from the Woodsides, the Gina Rineharts and the Twiggy Forrests. Put them first, value their profits and you will continue to sell young people down the river, destroying our future and condemning us to battle a climate apocalypse. It is our future as a generation that is on the line, and only the Greens are willing to advocate the reduction in emissions necessary to keep our planet safe and to guarantee a safe future for our generation, as young people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To have such a vital report as this greeted by such hollow nonsense is a disgrace and a shame on this parliament, which should be taking swift and urgent action to address the climate crisis that is now our lived reality. The inability to do that is why so many young people are so deeply frustrated with Australian politics. It is why so many of us are absolutely disgusted with and turned off the major parties. It is why so many of us are looking for alternatives. It is why, I'm proud to say, so many of us are supporting the Greens and why so many of us will be working together in the lead-up to the next election to ensure that the Greens are returned to this place with more members among us to deliver for the community the climate action which is so urgently demanded and needed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:02</span>):  We cannot separate climate justice from First Nations justice. Before I begin, I want to thank my colleague Senator Waters for bringing this important public urgency matter to this place and for her staunch calls for climate action this morning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, we watched this country burn as we experienced one of the worst bushfire seasons in our recorded history. The sixth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change tells us that First Nations knowledge is a vital tool in the struggle for climate justice. First Nations people have cared for and protected our lands and waters, including our totems, for tens of thousands of years, but, due to disregard for traditional forms of land management, we are seeing a breakdown of traditional forms of land preservation. Recent breakdowns of ecological systems and harms to biodiversity have been linked to a disregard for traditional forms of land management and their displacement by imported and harmful practices, like when the colonisers came over on the boats and destroyed everything they touched.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The IPCC report acknowledges the contributions of First Nations people and First Nations scientists in helping record historical as well as current observations of a changing climate. This First Nations science enables climate scientists to paint a whole picture and understand holistically what we're doing to the planet. We know that First Nations land management reduces the risk of catastrophic fire damage. We know that our land protectors out there play a crucial role in reducing the risk of wildfires and mitigating shifts in the fire season. We need to lead with what we know is most effective. We must put First Nations knowledge at the forefront of our climate action and policy to safeguard our country and the people that call this place home. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now is the time to build a better normal out of this crisis. Together we can change politics in this country. We can kick the Liberals out and put the Greens in the balance of power. Greens in the balance of power means that there are enough Greens in parliament that the government needs to consult with to make laws. That way we can make laws that are good for people and our country, because we know that 'Lib' and 'Lab' are pretty much the same these days, particularly when it comes to climate. With the balance of power, the Greens will push the next government to go harder and faster on climate change. The last time the Greens and Labor were in shared power, we passed laws to bring down pollution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coal and gas are causing the greatest damage to people, and we know that the Liberals and the Labor Party continue to take those dirty donations from the oil and gas companies. That's why they won't talk about their target, and that's why they're all talk and no action. We can continue to enjoy our lives in harmony, with plenty of energy from clean sources like sun and wind, or we can become a climate denier, a climate criminal, or the climate terrorists that the previous senator spoke aboutâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">Jama'at Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) is a Bangladeshi Sunni violent extremist group which aims to remove democracy, liberalism, socialism and secularism and institute an Islamic state in Bangladesh. The group's ideology broadly aligns with al-Qaeda and their global jihadist ideals. Since it was first listed on 9 June 2018, JMB has continued to conduct terrorist attacks. There are no known direct links between JMB and Australia, and while Australians are unlikely to be directly targeted, they may be incidentally harmed in attacks perpetrated at tourist sites in Bangladesh.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">Neo-Jama'at Mujahideen Bangladesh (Neo-JMB) was first listed as an alias of JMB on 9 June 2018l; however, the group is operating independently of JMB and has been listed as a terrorist organisation. The group is assessed to be an affiliate of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and subscribes to Islamic State's anti-Western ideology which would consider Australians to be legitimate targets of attack. Neo-JMB has been assessed to have been responsible for a number of terrorist attacks, and in Australia a Bangladeshi student who was reportedly a Neo-Jama'at Mujahideen Bangladesh member was responsible for a lone-actor stabbing attack in Melbourne on 9 February 2018. Neo-JMB favours lone-wolf or small-group attacks in which Australians may also be incidentally targeted while overseas.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2021 will amend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Customs Tariff Act 1995</span> (Customs Tariff Act) to incorporate three customs tariff proposals which provide for a 'Free' rate of customs duty for a range of imported goods. Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2021, Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) 2021 and Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 3) 2021 were tabled in Parliament in February, March and May of this year, respectively. The measures contained in these proposals have supported the availability of health and hygiene products in the Australian community, contributed to Australia's ability to fulfil international defence commitments and facilitated continued research and development in the automotive sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The incorporation of the measure contained in Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2021 extends, from 31 December 2020 to 30 June 2021, the 'Free' rate of customs duty for imported prescribed medical and hygiene products capable of use in combating the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Temporary concessional item 57 of Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act commenced on 1 February 2020 and, with industry support, the end date of the concession was previously extended from 31 July 2020 to 31 December 2020. As we continue to feel the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Australian Government remains committed to protecting the health of all Australians. This further extension will ensure that individuals and businesses continue to have access to the essential supplies required to keep themselves and other members of the community safe. Under this measure a 'Free' rate of customs duty will apply to masks, gloves, gowns, soaps and certain disinfectant preparations and protective eyewear. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The second measure in this Bill incorporates the measure contained in Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) 2021. This will insert new item 58 into Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act. This concessional item provides a 'Free' rate of customs duty for imported goods that are for use in the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter Program. This measure supports Australia's participation under the Joint Strike Fighter Production, Sustainment and Follow-on Development Memorandum of Understanding, which was signed in 2006 and gives effect to the commitment to achieving tax neutrality made by Australia under the Memorandum of Understanding. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Lastly, this Bill incorporates the measure in Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 3) 2021 to insert new concessional item 39A into Schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act. This item provides a 'Free' rate of customs duty for imported prescribed motor vehicles and motor vehicle components imported by an automotive service provider who was previously registered under the Automotive Transformation Scheme (within the meaning of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Automotive Transformation Scheme Act 2009</span>), where the time for working out duty is between 1 April 2021 and 30 June 2025. These goods must be imported for use in the testing, quality control, manufacturing evaluation or engineering development of motor vehicles designed or engineered in Australia under security. Item 39A extends the treatment previously provided to these goods during the operation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Automotive Transformation Scheme. </span>With the end of the second stage of this Scheme, the concessional item ensures that companies previously registered under the scheme can continue to access the customs duty concession and are not subject to additional regulatory burden.</span>

Of course, it's the day after the IPCC sixth assessment report landed, a report which the UN Secretary-General described as a 'code red for humanity'. He said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The alarm bells are deafening and the evidence is irrefutable: Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and deforestation are choking our planet and putting billions of people at immediate risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a week of unprecedented fires in Greece, a Northern Hemisphere summer of 47 degrees being recorded in Canada, unprecedented wildfires across the US and Russia, and unprecedented floods in Germany and Chinaâ€”and, of course, after our Black Summer bushfires of the summer of 2019-20, which killed over three billion animals. Yet our government is in denial, and the Labor Party are in denial when it comes to the need for urgent action by 2030 to slash our carbon pollution by at least half for Australia to be playing its part in tackling the climate crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How would a parliamentary office of science have changed this? In the words of the UK Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, which could be one possible model for an Australian parliamentary office of science, the debate here today and going forward would have been informed by trusted and impartial analysis. We need more than just the scientific advice that is currently given to government. We need quality, reliable, impartial scientific advice to every parliamentarian to inform our decision-making and for that advice to be largely public advice. Parliamentarians could then ignore it. They could challenge it. They could debate it, if they wished. But it would be at their peril. The work of scientists needs to be front and centre in the decisions that we make in our parliament, and the work of Australian scientists, in particular, needs to be celebrated and made accessible to all Australian MPs, including to those from whom we heard this afternoon: Senator McMahon, who was saying that our climate depends on sun spots; Senators Rennick and Roberts, who deny the climate science altogether; and, in fact, the Labor senators, who are silent on the scientifically assessed need to be slashing our carbon pollution by at least half by 2030.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to, in the context of this debate of privileging and highlighting science, particularly salute the over 40 Australian scientists who are lead authors of the IPCC report that was released yesterday. Thank you for your perseverance, for sitting in the fire, for spending each day confronting the reality of the existential threats to our planet. I am listening; the Greens are listening. We will keep working to convert your science into legislation, for Australia to act in the urgent way that is needed to confront our climate crisis, to act as if our house is on fire, because it is. Of course, this proposed referral for an inquiry into a parliamentary office of science isn't only about climate scientists, as relevant as they are today. It's about those scientists working on COVID, on vaccines, on environmental protectionâ€”across the gamut of science. A parliamentary office of science would mean their advice would be regularly, reliably and impartially conveyed to all parliamentarians in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I want to go specifically to the issue of this referral today, which, of course, is to set up an inquiry about scientific advice to this parliament and, in particular, the appropriateness of a parliamentary office of science. Our referral today is based on the basic principles that guide the Australian Greens when it comes to policy in general and science policy particularly. We believe that research is essential for social progress and it's a public good. And we believe that scientific principles and the practice of independent, peer reviewed research is essential to the development and availability of high-quality knowledge and must not be compromised. And, most importantly, we believe it's essential that policymaking is informed by high-quality evidence and scientific research.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's because we value the contribution of scientific research and expertise that I particularly want to acknowledge the contribution of the Rapid Research Information Forum, or RRIF. Since early last year, of course, we've been responding to a worldwide pandemic in ways that have been often very complex and very challenging. There have been major policy responses, but often they've depended on understanding and answering new and complex questions about a virus that, as we know, is still mutating and evolving. So we have seen an incredibly valuable contribution from the RRIF with multiple papers published on a whole range of questions, and we welcome the contribution of the Australian Academy of Science in leading that important work as well as a whole range of individuals and organisations across the sector in contributing collaboratively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the important contribution of the RRIF, it's sad to see so many areas of policy where ministers have actually ignored the scientific advice in making their decisions. It's hard to know where to start, and it highlights the need for the advice from the RRIF to be elevated and underpinned by something like a parliamentary office of science. The areas where Liberal ministers have been ignoring the scientific advice include: ignoring the scientific advice on forest ecology, which means that native forest logging is continuing across the country; ignoring the advice on faunal extinction and conservation, weakening rather than strengthening our environmental laws; and, critically, as I've already discussed, ignoring the evidence on climate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as government policy, there have been MPs freelancing on their own, often undermining, at critical points, some of the evidence that we've received here in the building. One member of the government's party in the other place was permanently banned from Facebook for spreading misinformation about COVID-19. Imagine how bad your content needs to be to be banned from Facebook, a platform that's regularly used by conspiracy theorists and far-Right extremists to spread their ideas! It's very clear that we need a much greater use and prominence of science in our decision-making here, and we need parliamentarians to be held to account when they are spruiking far-out ideas that are completely debunked by good science. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you think about the problems that we've got with science not informing our decisions here in Australia, it's important to think about how this could be different. One positive example is the UK's Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, or POST. The UK POST produces impartial, non-partisan and peer-reviewed briefings designed to make scientific research available to the UK parliament. In an Australian context, that could be incredibly valuable. Think of the contribution a POST could make to debating COVID relief bills, changes to environment laws, changes to health frameworks and farming frameworks or, of course, climate and energy policy. For example, on climate targets, their recent advice to the UK parliament included the following:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Achieving net zero by 2050 will be highly challenging and, although existing policy does not put the UK on track to meet interim milestones, there is emerging consensus across the private sector and civil society on the importance of climate mitigation. There is also a growing number of industry organisations outside of the immediate energy and climate space that are now aligning their operations with net zero by 2050. However, several groups argue that the 2050 date would need to be brought forward to make the UK's targets compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5Â°C under a stricter interpretation of 'equity' assumptions. Globally, current Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) emissions reduction pledges emitted by all nations under the Paris Agreement fail to reach even the lower end of the Agreement's ambition. Recent CCC modelling has demonstrated a route to UK net zero by the early 2040s for the first time, under a scenario in which both innovation and public appetite for behaviour change all develop faster than expected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Basically, the POST is able to summarise contentious science and present it to parliamentarians in a way which is trusted and impartial and which parliamentarians cannot avoid, ignore or turn a blind eye to. It would be there to be considered as part of our decision-making processes. That would mean we would not be in a situation where the Labor Party are silent on 2030 targets. We would not be in a situation where we have government backbenchers spruiking completely fanciful models. They could still do that that, but it would be very clear that it was completely inconsistent with the appropriate science that was being presented to the parliament in an impartial and reliable way. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the motion before us today is not to establish a parliamentary office of science. It's simply putting the question to the Senate to consider: what is the current state of scientific advice to the Australian parliament, and can it be improved? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a really important question and one we think is worth examining. We would welcome the opportunity to hear from policymakers, scientific researchers, academic experts and the general community. I've talked to a lot of key science stakeholders over the last few months as we've been developing this proposal for a parliamentary office of science and developing this idea of having an inquiry. They have been very positive about it, because they know; they want to see science given a much higher status and much greater salience in the decision-making of the Australian parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose, of course, of a Senate inquiry is to hear from the whole community and to gather the information. So I really commend this motion to the Senate. I think it's an incredibly important motion, particularly on a day like today, when we see the extent to which science is influencing our futureâ€”given the climate crisis we're facing that's front of mind for us all todayâ€”and we know that we need to be elevating the importance of science in our decision-making. I really hope this motion to establish an inquiry to look at scientific advice to the parliament will be supported across party lines in the Senate this afternoon. Thank you.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="AW5" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KIM CARR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:36</span>):  At one level this is a very simple proposition that seeks to refer to the economics committee a proposal on how we can improve the scientific advice to this parliament. So I was somewhat surprised when I was advised that the government is going to vote against this proposition. I was surprised because I have represented the Labor Party on scientific matters for many, many years, and it's a matter of deep concern to me that we have not had an adequate level of investment and understanding of the importance of scientific advice to this parliament. As a consequence I've long held the view that the British modelâ€”followed by the American model, in terms of their advice to their Congressâ€”is a model that we could adopt in this country. As a consequence we did look at this issue in the Senate inquiry into nationhood, national identity and democracy. That committee 'recommended that the Australian Government establish a Parliamentary Office of Science, modelled on the United Kingdom Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, to provide independent, impartial scientific advice, evidence and data to the Parliament, and all members and senators'. It was recommendation 14, and I chaired that inquiry. It was a recommendation that was bipartisan. So I'm particularly concerned that the government now finds this proposition dangerous, that it says that there's adequate advice and we don't need to have this reference. Somehow or other, this has suddenly become a contentious issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If members and senators are going to debate and pass laws that govern Australians, they do need access to reliable and impartial information. They don't need to have ideologically loaded information. I acknowledge there will be differences of opinion about the nature of that information, but they do need access to the very best information. You simply can't rely upon the department to provide that on their own. It's possible that even fine organisations like our scientific agencies are able to present information which is contestable. We hear, on a regular basis, 'It is contestable.' I take the view that it is important that the institutions and processes of parliamentary democracy would not be possible without that debate or access. The proposed science office would in fact enhance democracy in this country. It would enhance our understanding of how this country is actually faring and of the fact, for instance, that the IPCC report has highlighted the challenges this country faces. The arguments about how we deal with those challenges are inherent in the political process. We don't have to agree about the mechanism by which we address those challenges, but we do have to address those challenges, and the pursuit of that advice through proper scientific analysis is critical to that solution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've got is an example of the government opposing this motion because inherent within this government is a fundamental hostility to scientific inquiry. A war on science has been the hallmark of this government throughout its life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are now debating whether or not an office would be useful and whether or not creating such an office would enhance our work as members of parliament. That's an extraordinary proposition. The debate is about whether or not it would enable us to better serve the people of this country, who actually pay our wages, who, of course, we are supposed to serve and who look to us to provide advice. What's the argument about the establishment of a parliamentary office of science? They say there's sufficient advice already available through the Office of the Chief Scientist and other advisory bodies to the government. No-one's disputing the fact that we do have quality advice available, but is anyone realistically going to say that that's adequate? Is anyone realistically going to be able to argue a case that it's sufficient? Is anyone really going to be able to maintain a proposition that it's appropriate and that we have enough advice in terms of the way in which the challenges facing this country are being addressed?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's already an available model for the provision of independent advice: the Parliamentary Budget Office. Is anyone going to say suddenly that the Treasury is being usurped because there's an independent Parliamentary Budget Office? Does anyone suggest that the authority of the Treasury is now so fundamentally challenged that we can't function? It's a complete nonsense. Public servants in the Treasury department and the Department of Finance do provide advice to the government of the day, but there needs to be an independent source of advice to the parliament. That's why a proposition such as this provides us with a vehicle to ensure that that can happen. It's important that the parliament has its own source of advice on fiscal questions. We've accepted that, but we don't accept it in regard to scientific questions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliamentary office of science would be able to provide that same level of advice that the Parliamentary Budget Office does. It would provide the information we need to be able to do our jobs properly as members of parliament. It's about our job to hold governments to account and, above all, to serve the people who send us here. That's what I find quite extraordinary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not the first time that we've heard this argument from the government: 'Just trust us.' By taking that attitude, the government is really saying: 'We want to maintain control. We want to maintain access. We want to be able to provide that vital resource, the information that allows us to tell you what's good for you.' Well, that's not satisfactory. That's no way to exercise parliamentary accountability. What we have to have is access to independent, reliable information on matters that require scientific expertise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The message running throughout the recommendations in the nationhood inquiry was that we build trust within the public, within the nation, if we can provide the proper levels of communication about these questions and if we can debate these questions on the basis of sound knowledge, not just prejudice. If this parliament is to do its job properly, we have to restore public confidence in the work we undertake. It's a fundamental principle of the way in which democracy ought to function.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The lesson of the pandemic is that the public is wide open to the proposition that you can trust scientific advice, but it needs to be presented properly. It needs to be presented on the basis that it is contestable. There's no magic formula; there are no Ten Commandments. There has to be a debate about these things based on sound advice. That's the way citizens respond positively to medical emergencies and fundamental questions of public health. Unfortunately, ill-informed comments have all too often been heard throughout our political system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Former Chief Scientist Professor Ian Chubb proposed that the Australian government set up a formal relationship between parliament and the scientific community. The formal relationship would define what it means to provide scientific advice to the parliament and the government. That relationship does exist within the United Kingdom, where the parliament has signed an agreement setting out the roles and responsibilities of the two parties. I have advanced before the proposition of a charter between the parliament and the scientific community. Professor Chubb argued the case that we need to have an agreement that includes such things as scientists having an obligation to provide free, frank advice that is as good as they could possibly offer, given the advice that was available to them in their own expertise and their own work, and, on the other side, the parliament having a commitment to make that advice public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This process of course led to the creation of POST, the UK Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, which the nationhood inquiry, as I've indicated, recommended as a model for this country. POST works well because both houses of the UK parliament are involved and describe the job as 'helping to bridge the gap between research and policy by providing parliamentarians with up-to-date research evidence and expertise to inform legislation and scrutiny'. This gets captured by scientists. POSTâ€”and I've read its material for many yearsâ€”is balanced, is actually in plain English and acknowledges the importance of social considerations as well as the purely scientific. It has proved its worth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has existed since 1989. It was established under the Thatcher governmentâ€”that great radical Margaret Thatcher. For this reactionary mob here it's far too dangerous to be able to undertake something like that. No-one in the United Kingdom argued that somehow or other it usurped the role of the government's own advisers. POST is jointly funded by the houses of parliament in the United Kingdom. It's overseen by a board made up of 10 members of the House of Commons and four members of the House of Lords. They are chosen on the basis that they reflect the balance of the parties in the parliament. Researchers are chosen by learned academies, representing the breadth of scientific disciplines, and representatives of the research and information committees of the parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no reason why a similar model couldn't apply here. This reference would provide us with a vehicle to check all of those things out. We should be conscious of how damage has been done in terms of democracies with uninformed opinion and the breakdown of trust in public institutions. The establishment of a formal relationship between a nation's scientists and the parliament is important to restore trust and is important to re-establish confidence in the parliamentary system itself. It would also work to overcome the toxic effect of the scurrilous attacks on science and scientistsâ€”attacks promoted by members of this parliament, who should know better. Of course they've done it for very partisan reasons. They think there's a vote in it. They think that building on prejudice and building upon popular reactionary nationalist emotions is going to somehow or other produce a political dividend for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard various elements suggest that this is somehow or other about defending Western civilisation. Strangely, these are the same people who don't usually have any science in mind when they talk about Western civilisation being under threat. Modern science is one of the finest achievements of Western civilisation. It is the flowering of the enlightenment values of organised rational inquiryâ€”inquiry into the nature of the world around us and inquiry into humanity's place in the world. Science has transformed life for the better for people all over the world, yet in our time we have come to witness attacks on science by people who want to spread mistrust. This is a time of anxiety. People are inciting fear about the consequences of new developments in science and technology because of the impact of these developments on the future of work, because of concern about changes in the climate, because of the threat of the spread of disease and because of fears for our international strategic situation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the government's election in 2013, it's allowed the fearmongers in its ranks to influence public policy to an extent way beyond their intellectual capacities. We've seen cuts to the public science agencies, we've seen the failure to fund our university research agencies and we've seen a war on science which has undermined our capacity to deal with the really big problems facing our society. We simply can't turn our backs on the enlightenment. This is a big problem for this government. They have yet to come to terms with the enlightenment. We should be standing with science and we should take advice from the scientific community. We should defend those who elect us, rebuild public confidence and rebuild confidence in parliamentary democracies by ensuring that people understand that we are acting for the future of humanity and we should be trying to build hope rather than extinguishing it. By investing in science, by demonstrating our trust in science, we are in fact strengthening democracy. Democracy only thrives when we have a respect for the truth. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:51</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I will discuss the cost of shoddy science that is crippling people, families, communities and our nation. One Nation has repeatedly called for and continues to call for an independent office of scientific integrity and quality assurance to assess the science claimed to be underpinning government policy and decisions. We want objective, independent scientific scrutiny that is protected from politicisation. Science is a not a label; it is hard, verifiable, reliable data within a framework that proves cause and effect logically. It is every senator's responsibility to ensure that she or he makes decisions using such data.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give you some examples of the cost of shoddy science that has not been scrutinised. Climate policies and renewable subsidies cost Australian households via electricity costs $13 billion per year, every year. That's $1,300 per household per year needlessly wasted. The median income in this country is $49,000. After tax, that's around $34,000 or maybe a little bit higher. How can someone on $34,000 after tax afford $1,300 flushed down the toilet, for nothing? The additional costs of climate policies on our power bills is a staggering 39 per cent, not the 6Â½ per cent that the government claims. Renewables distort the low cost of coal based power and more than double the wholesale electricity price from coal's $45.50 per kilowatt hour to $92.50. China and India use our coal to sell electricity at 8c a kilowatt hour, while we burn the same coal without transporting it thousands of kilometres and the price of electricity from the coal is three times as much at 25c an hour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All Australians have the right to benefit from our rich natural resources. The true cost of electricity in this country would be $13 billion per year less if cheap, affordable, reliable coal production was not lumbered with policies that distort the market. We commissioned independent expert and respected economist Dr Alan Moran to calculate those figures, and he used the government's own data. So it can't be sensibly refuted. The government stopped presenting it in consolidated form to hide what government policy is doing to everyday Australians in our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every subsidised green energy job or so-called renewable job, from renewable or unreliable power, such as wind and solar, costs 2.2 jobs lost in the real economy. Parasitic unreliables are killing their host, the people of Australia and the people of Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can go further, beyond raw data on energy costs, to look at property rights. Property rights have been stolen in this country in the name of the Kyoto Protocol. John Howard's Howard-Anderson government started it with Rob Borbidge's National Party government in Queensland, followed quickly by Peter Beattie's government and every government since, with the exception of Campbell Newman, who failed to repeal it. Property rights have been stolen with no compensation. That is fundamentally wrong. We see it in water policy, with corruption in the Murray-Darling Basin when it comes to water trading. We see the stealing of water rights, all based on shoddy science. The whole Murray-Darling Basin Plan is based on shoddy scienceâ€”political science. Instead of having science based policy, we now have policy based science, and both sides of this parliament are responsible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Carr, who I have a lot of regard for in many ways, raised COVID. We have not been given the scientific data on COVID. We've been given models. The scientific data which I got from the Chief Medical Officer points to a completely different picture and to completely different management. COVID is being mismanaged in the name of science. It is wrong. By the way, the costs of all of those examples I've given are not in the billions but in the tens or hundreds of billions, and the impact on our country's economy is in the trillions, with the lost opportunity and the lack of competitiveness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">COVID exposed to us that our country has lost its economic independence. We now depend on other countries for our survivalâ€”for basics. We've lost our manufacturing sector because of shoddy governance from the Labor, Liberal and National parties over almost eight decades, since 1944. In the last 18 months, we've seen the Liberals, Labor and the Nationals squabbling at state and federal level, because there is no science being used to drive the plan. There's no plan for COVID management. Each state is lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis, and the federal government is bypassing the Constitution and conditioning them to suck on the federal tit. That's what's going on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at the science. I have held CSIRO accountable at three presentations from them, plus Senate estimates. Firstly, the CSIRO has admitted under my cross-examination that the CSIRO has never said that carbon dioxide from human activity is a dangerâ€”never. We asked them: 'Who has said it? Politicians told us you said it.' They said, 'You'd have to ask the politicians.' Secondly, CSIRO has admitted that today's temperatures are not unprecedented. I'll say that againâ€”not unprecedented. They've happened before in recent times without our burning of hydrocarbon fuels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the CSIRO then fell back on one thingâ€”one paper, after almost 50 years of research, that said that the rate of warming is now increasing. That too was falsified by the author of that paper. It was falsified and contradicted by other references which the CSIRO had to then give us. There is no evidence for the CSIRO's sole claim that the rate of temperature rise is unprecedented. Its own papers that it cites do not show that. The CSIRO then relied upon unvalidated computer models that were already proven to be giving erroneous projections. That's what the UN IPCC relies on. They've already been proven wrong many times. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The clincher is that, to have policy based upon science, you would need to quantify the amount of impact on climate variables such as weather: rainfall; storm activity, severity and frequency; and drought. You'd need to be able to quantify the impact on that of carbon dioxide from human activity. The CSIRO has never quantified any specific impact on climate, or any climate variable, from human carbon dioxide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With us, the CSIRO has repeatedly relied on discredited and poor-quality papers on temperature and carbon dioxide. It gave us one of each, and then, when we tore them to shreds, they gave us more. We tore them to shreds. It has never given us any good-quality scientific papers. That's their science. The CSIRO revealed little understanding of the papers they cited as evidence. That's our scientific body in this countryâ€”they could not show understanding of the papers that they cited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The CSIRO admits it has never done due diligence on reports and data that it cites as evidence. It just accepts peer review. What a lot of rubbish that is! That has been shown in peer-reviewed articles to be rubbish. The CSIRO allows politicians to misrepresent it without correction. It doesn't stand upâ€”it doesn't have any backbone. The CSIRO has misled parliament. Independent international scientists have verified our conclusions on the CSIRO science, and they're stunnedâ€”people like John Christy, Nir Shaviv, Nils Morner, David Legates, Ian Plimer and Will Happer. There is no climate emergencyâ€”none at all. Everything is normal. It's completely cyclical weather.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I'll move to the UK's Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, which has turned into a propaganda outfit and a mouthpiece and cheer squad for global policies. Politics has captured it and turned it into a massive bureaucracy that writes legislation rather than checks it. POST, as it's called, comprises people, as Senator Carr said, 'consistent with parliamentary composition'. That tells us straight away that it's not independent. Instead of a body to drive legislation we want a body to vet it. Senator Carr mentioned the Office of the Chief Scientist. I asked the Chief Scientist for a presentation on his evidence of climate change caused by human carbon dioxide. After 20 minutes of rubbish we asked him questions and he looked at us and said that he's not a climate scientist and he doesn't understand it. Yet we have policies around this country based upon Dr Finkel's advice. Some of those policies that I mentioned are based on his advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had activists, such as Tim Flannery, David Karoly, Will Steffen, Ross Garnaut, Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, Matthew England, Kurt Lambeck, Andy Pitman and Lesley Hughes, being paraded and paid by the governmentâ€”both Liberal and Laborâ€”and yet they're nothing more than academic activists. None have provided any empirical scientific evidence in a logical framework proving cause and effect. That's what has been paraded around this parliament as science for decades now. It's rubbish. That's why One Nation opposes this motion. It is wasting committee resources to send them off on a goose chase to adopt something like the UK's Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We invite Senator Carr to join us in legislating for an independent body of scientists to scrutinise government policy and decisions. Let the government put up the science upon which its policies are based and let the independent body scrutinise it. That requires a few things. First of all, it needs a team funded and set up to oppose the government's position, and we'll let them both go at it. Science, fundamentally, is about data and debate. We need the government to put up its science and let a team tear it apartâ€”and be funded to tear it apart. Once that happens, and the science is dismissed, that will save the country billions of dollars. If it withstands the scrutiny, that's goodâ€”we'll know we've got a really solid scientific case. Another way is to have a transparency portal. Put the science out there and let anybody in the public domain tear it apart. If someone finds a chink, fix it. True scientists are not about protecting their egos; they're about being open to the advancement of humanity. They welcome their own science being torn apart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need an independent view. The type of information, as the motion discusses, is simple. All we need is empirical scientific evidence in a framework proving cause and effect. We then need independent scrutiny, and I've given you two examples. That will replace policiesâ€”as Senator Carr has discussed, and I agree with himâ€”based on ideology, headline-seeking, prejudice, opinions, looking after vested interests and looking after donors. This is what's driving this country, and the people are paying for it. They're paying for it through the neck, and we're destroying our country. We need the 'claimed' science to be scrutinised and verified or rejected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What a shameful, disgraceful incident we saw in this parliament just after midday today. We saw Senator Wong, Senator Watt and Senator Waters engaging in a screaming match. Not once did anyone raise empirical scientific evidence. This is day 701 since I asked the chief proponent of this climate change nonsense in the parliament to be accountable for her data. I asked Senator Waters. I challenged her 701 days agoâ€”almost two years ago. I challenged her 11 years ago. She has never agreed to debate me. She refuses to debate me. She refuses to put up the scientific evidence. She refuses to discuss the corruption of climate science. Yet she espouses policies that will gut this country. Also, we've seen Senator Wong quoting a report from the IPCC. That's not a report from scientists; that's a report from political activists. She talks about what we are toldâ€”insert the catastropheâ€”will happen in the future. That's not science. What we need is an honest debate. We need an honest debate to reveal the pure science and to hold people accountable in the parliament. We will not be supporting this motion because it will encourage politicisation.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Madam Deputy President. There's the antiscience rubbish that is spouted from that side of the chamber from the Morrison government. I might say it's not just confined to the backbench. We have Senator Rennick, Mr George Christensen, Senator Canavan and a bunch of others, but we also have the Deputy Prime Minister, who is one of the cheerleaders of antiscience in this parliamentâ€”so much so that he dismisses climate change science almost in totality and dismisses the science in relation to water security in this country. Even this afternoon, the Leader of the National Party, the Deputy Prime Minister of this country, Mr Joyce, had his party declare that they are going to amend the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act in this place when it comes before the parliament tomorrow, to remove the prohibition on nuclear power in this country. They don't quote science in relation to this. It is all part of their crazy whack job agenda. It is part of the tin foil hat brigade which keeps the seats warm on that side of the chamber in the Morrison government. It suits the Prime Minister, of course, to have these crazy fringe groups within his own party banging on about this stuff, because it makes him look almost reasonable. Everything is relative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You see the scientific facts, the warning signs from around the world, and the world's leading climate scientists tell us, point blank, that we are running out of time to take action on climate change and reverse the catastrophe facing our environment. If you're the Prime Minister of the country and you stand at a press conference today addressing the nation and telling them you're doing enough, it's because you don't believe in science; it's because you don't have regard for science and scientific fact; it's because you don't listen to the experts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this is the same Prime Minister who, when the COVID pandemic first hit and was spreading rapidly across the world and was starting to spread across Australia, dismissed the concerns of the experts. He said it was fine to shake hands. He said it was fine to go to the football. He said: 'We don't need any type of border controls. We don't need lockdowns. We probably don't even need a vaccine.' The Prime Minister was dragged kicking and screaming to take action in the midst of this pandemic, and it was because the rest of the country listened to the science. It was because other leaders around this country, our state premiersâ€”of both persuasions, I might addâ€”listened to the science and the health experts. It wasn't because it was coming from the Prime Minister. It certainly wasn't coming from the top.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to come back to this point about why this government is dismissing this important reference today to establish a parliamentary office of science. It's because they don't want to be challenged. They don't want to be held to account. We've got people like Mr Barnaby Joyce, the Deputy Prime Minister, free-ranging on government policy, proposing to move drastic amendments to government legislation, such as building nuclear power in this country, without any facts, without any science, without regard to the huge amount of nuclear waste that something like this creates, and without regard to the cost, the time frame or the huge amount of water that Australia actually can't afford in the midst of a drying climate. We don't even have time to daydream about these types of projects anymore. The science is clear. We have to take action now, and we know what we have to do. We have to get onto renewables. And it's here: it's wind; it's solar; it's storage. We don't have the luxury of spending billions and billions and billions of dollars on feasibility studies for some pixie dust idea of a nuclear power plant in 20 years time. The climate is already in crisis. Of course, this is what has happened to this government. Mr Morrison has lost control. The science-deniers on his sideâ€”the science deniers that sit on both the frontbench and the backbench of this governmentâ€”are running rings around the Prime Minister, creating chaos wherever they can find it.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have one question for the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Joyce. He has today announced that the National Party want a nuclear power station to be built in this country. They want to amend laws tomorrow in this place. Where's it going to go? In whose town and whose suburb is Mr Joyce's first nuclear power plant going to be built? I put it to you that, if a member of the National Party can walk in here tonight or tomorrow and tell us in which town they want this nuclear power station built, I'll debate them in the town. Let's hire the hall and let's get it started. They won't, because they are cowards. They are running an antiscience agenda. They're running an anticlimate agenda. They are anti-planet, they're anti-people and they're anti-Australian. They want to hold our country back. They are all in it for themselves. They think this is a quick, cheap political pointscoring exercise. It will get them some headlines.</span>

He refuses to call out Mr Christensen in terms of his COVID denialism and spreading of lies. They refuse to call out Senator Rennick for his reckless comments and behaviour. They refuse to call out Senator Canavan. The nut jobs in the National Party have the Prime Minister running scared.</span>

The coalition government has invested record amounts of funding in scientific research and development. Our open and transparent approach to scientific advice has helped drive our world-leading response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Just this week, for example, the government provided not only the parliament but the entire nation with the Doherty Institute modelling that underpins our approach to vaccination. The proposal to create a new body would see more taxpayer money spent on more bureaucracy, duplicate existing functions and mechanisms and see no appreciable gain in the effectiveness or the efficacy of scientific advice.</span>

But our support for the bill shouldn't be taken as an endorsement of the Liberals' childcare policy; it is not. We know that the Liberals' policy on childcare fee assistance doesn't go far enough. Indeed, it is a missed opportunity to drive the economic recovery and a missed opportunity to support families with children in early learning. When it comes to childcare fee policyâ€”</span>

                    </a>  Labor's support for this legislation shouldn't be taken as an endorsement of the Liberals' childcare fee policy. It is not. It's a missed opportunity. As I said, it's a missed opportunity in terms of the economic recovery, a missed opportunity to support families with kids in early learning. Our policy, Labor's policy, is clearly more beneficial to more families and more children in care. It's better because we genuinely believe in the benefits of early learning. We believe in the benefits for productivity for our economy. We haven't, like the Liberals, been dragged kicking and screaming to a sensible position on fees. We value early learning. We value the children in it. We value the families who rely on it. We value the workforce which delivers it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite promising a once-in-a-generation reform of early learning, we have seen consistent fee increases under the coalition governmentâ€”indeed a 36 per cent increase since 2013. Childcare costs have been growing at approximately double CPI over the past quarter. The government predicts these costs to grow by a further 4.7 per cent in the next four years. Why does this matter beyond cost-of-living concerns? It matters because child care and early learning are beneficial for the children in it. It's beneficial for the many families who rely on it. It's beneficial for productivity. It's beneficial for our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The policy which underpins this legislation was announced to great fanfare earlier this year. While the fee relief is welcomeâ€”of course it isâ€”and that's why we'll support this bill, let's be clear about who misses out under the Liberals' policy. We know there are more than 700,000 families who will receive no lift at all. Under this policy every single Australian family with one child aged five or under in care with a combined family income of less than $530,000 a year will not receive any lift in benefit. Any extra support the Liberals' policy provides to families with two children in child care will be ripped away once the family's oldest child goes to school. What's more, it doesn't start until July 2022, which is absurd when we know how important and urgent fee relief is for families now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there is another way. There is Labor's policy, which the government could adopt. Labor's policy, which does not discriminate based on the size of a family, which has no age cut-off and which applies to all children using outside school hours care during primary school. Our policy will boost support for every child whilst they're in child care and will leave one million Australian families better off. Push your pride aside and sign up to it. It's good policy. It's good policy if you genuinely believe in the importance of fee reform and fee relief. But of course, that's key, right? You've got to genuinely believe in it. You've got to genuinely believe in the sector which this legislation seeks to assist, the sector which holds the key to greater productivity, greater economic benefits and greater social benefits from improving access to early learning. Every time we invest in early learning in Australia we're not just investing in social reform, we're investing in productivity, we're investing in economic growth. That's critical to remember.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor gets it. We get the importance of early learning. I stand up here and I speak about this frequently. We get it. We believe the science. We've just had a far-ranging discussion in this place on science. Let's talk about the science of early learning. We know that in those first 1,000 days of a child's life critical brain connections are formed. If those brain connections aren't formed there can be dire consequences for the children involved. They're formed through some of the most simple and pleasurable things for a child: counting fingers and toes, singing songs, telling nursery rhymes. These sorts actions help a child develop. For some children the place they get that interaction, they get that stimulation, they have that opportunity for those connections to form, is in an early learning setting. For particularly vulnerable children that can be the only place where those brain connections have the opportunity to come alive. That's why it's so important for vulnerable kids especially. That's why our early educators are absolutely doing life-changing work every single day, life-changing work for the children in our community who stand to benefit the most from the work they do and the support they provide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fee relief is absolutely an economic reform, an economic measure, a productivity measure, but it is one of the greatest things we can do socially in terms of enabling childrenâ€”and particularly those children who may not get a chance to go to an early learning setting if fee relief isn't providedâ€”to attend, to have those brain connections form, to have that stimulation, that care, that support which is provided in an early learning centre. It's a way of ensuring that children get that opportunity for the basic fundamentals of their early learning and development. That's what should guide our approach in this place to early learning and early education. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, early learning has been put at risk by the pandemic. We have seen the pandemic shut some children out of their early learning centreâ€”shut them out of that connection with their educators, shut them out from the potential to have those connections formed. We've seen our early learning educators under extraordinary pressure in trying to deliver the life-changing and critical work that they provide for children. We've seen them ignored. We've seen them let down. We saw their calls for help go unanswered at the beginning of the pandemic, when they were saying: 'Where's the PPE? When I wipe a child's nose, where's my PPE?' They were performing essential work not just in terms of the work they were providing for children in their care. The essential work they were doing meant our essential workers in other industries could go and do their jobs. The parents of the children they were caring for were on the front line of this pandemic. They couldn't have done that work, couldn't have staffed the hospitals, couldn't have been in our aged-care centres, couldn't have provided caring roles or policing roles or, indeed, even political roles if it hadn't been for the incredible early learning workforce standing there behind them and supporting them. It's those workers and those educators who have been let down so severely by the government during this pandemic. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're looking at a policy that to a great extent is about access, because feesâ€”costsâ€”determine access for many, many families. When you don't get that right, you don't give as many children the opportunity to attend an early learning centre. For many children, if they don't attend the early learning centre, they will miss out on so much. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Conversations in this place about early learning can be controversial. The reason for this is beyond me. This isn't about pitting families against each other. It isn't about your choices as a parent. It's about ensuring that all those children in our community who stand to benefit from access to an early learning centre, from access to our dedicated childcare workforce and from access to all the opportunities in terms of their development that early learning can bring have the opportunity to do that. That's what fee relief is about. It's about ensuring that all those parents who stand ready to make a contribution to our economy, to our society and to our community aren't prevented from doing so because they can't afford the hours and time in early learning and the hours and time in child care. It's absolutely critical on the economics, in terms of its social reform, in terms of productivity and of course for our children, for the kids in Australia who stand to benefit from it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I stand here as part of the Labor team, yes, supporting the legislation, we wish it went further. We wish it did better. And we wish it provided the critical recognition of the value of early learning, the value of child care and the value that the opportunity of attending care can bring to so many children. I earnestly wish that it did more, that it went further, that it did better, because there is so much more we can do to support the early learning and development of children in Australia. There is so much more we can do to show that we value our early learning educators, not just in what we say about them and how we thank them but also in how we pay them, how we respect them, how we treat their work and how we prioritise them as the essential workers they are. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a huge road ahead in getting early learning and childcare policy right in Australia. This was an opportunity to do so much more. Put your pride aside, follow Labor's policy and perhaps think creatively about the way our investments in this sector, our investments in early learning, could be truly transformative for our economy, for productivity, for families, for children in early learning and for our society as a whole. That would be a truly visionary thing to come out of this place, something worthy of the word 'reform'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In saying that, we do support the legislation. We support any effort to provide fee assistance for families. I am happy to do that. But I will be fighting every single day in here to make sure we strive to go furtherâ€”to deliver more, to value the children in early learning, to value the families who are using it and to value the sector for its contribution to Australia.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:35</span>):  I rise to speak on the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Subsidy) Bill 2021. I want to make one thing very, very clear from the outset: this is not a women's issue. Whilst, yes, it's a family issueâ€”a personal family issue of how they want to run their households, their lives and their working livesâ€”most importantly it is an economic issue. We on this side of the chamber, the Morrison government, want to ensure that we get the best economic outcomes across the board. It is a concept that's evidently beyond the grasp of the Greens, judging from their contributions in this debateâ€”and, to be fair, pretty much every debate. Senator Faruqi seemed to declare a formal power-sharing agreement with those opposite, something I've no doubt will send shivers up the spine of my friend the member for Hunter, Mr Fitzgibbon. But we can save that for another day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that earlier in the debate Senator Pratt was a bit upset about an internal debate within the coalition government. I appreciate that internal debate, a discussion of ideas, must be a very strange concept to those opposite, and perhaps even more surprising must be diversity of opinion. As Liberal women, we more than know that we're dismissed by those opposite, the so-called sisterhood, as nothing more than lapdogs to the men of our party, doing as we're told. We know it because when many of us on this side of the chamber receive derogatory and, unfortunately, often violent threats, which are publicly visible as they're usually transmitted over social media, what is it that we hear? Is it the cavalry? No. If it's coming to the defence of conservative women, that would be crickets we hear from those opposite, with a whispered, 'Well, they deserve it,' from the Caro-Wilkinson feminazis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To come back to the legislation and to Senator Pratt's point, I really do enjoy the irony that the whole concept of independent thought is foreign to you and, in fact, banned by your bosses. We on this side have our own agency, the ability to stand up for what we believe in, and in fact we support all womenâ€”and men and familiesâ€”who want to make choices as to how best they support their family life and work life. I know that to you guys on the other side of the chamberâ€”through you, Madam Deputy Presidentâ€”the whole idea of personal choice and personal responsibility, the idea that not all families fit into the designated box of whatever union is currently pulling the opposition leader's strings, is anathema. Families come in all shapes and sizesâ€”two parents, single parents, shared parents. Children can live mainly with mum; they can live with mum and dad; they can live mainly with dad. It's actually the women on this side of the chamberâ€”outrageously!â€”who don't assume it's always dad who's the main breadwinner, with mum at home watching <span style="font-style:italic;">Bluey</span> in her apron. Sometimes it's actually mum who's the main breadwinner. Sometimes mum has the bigger career. And sometimes, even once they become parents, both want to return to their careers. Some families, single-parent or not, don't have that choice. They're forced back to work for financial reasons. We need to support all of these families to best manage their lives, and we need to support most significantly those families who need the most support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Child care needs to be more affordable. We're actively supporting families with more than one child to get back to work sooner, should they wish to, without losing any additional income to childcare payments. This childcare subsidy will benefit around 250,000 Australian families. Subsidy levels in some cases will increase from 30 per cent to 95 per cent, with 50 per cent of those families paying on average just $21 a day for two children in care. Tens of thousands of families are set to benefit from the removal of the annual cap on the childcare subsidy. This will make it fairer for all Australian families. The removal of the cap will remove any disincentive for families to remain working or to increase their workforce participation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do we want to do it? Because we believe in supporting families. We support all families. We want parents to believe that they can have more children. I heard Senator O'Sullivan reference the Peter Costello quote: 'One for mum, one for dad and one for the country.' I have my three, and I have had a bit of a joke with Peter that I'm still asking where the one for the country should be sent, but, in truth, he's the light of my life, I love him dearly and I wouldn't send him anywhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do want families back in the workforce and we do want to allow them to arrange the care that suits their families the best way they can, if that's what they want to do. We want to put money back into the pockets of these familiesâ€”not unions and not the black armband curriculum brigadeâ€”because we know families can make better use of that funding and will be able to keep more income. We want to see children access quality early learning and care. We want it to be more affordable for families, and we want to make sure that all of that assistance is as targeted as it can be to ensure the families that require the most support receive that support.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:41</span>):  [by video link] I rise to speak on the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Subsidy) Bill 2021. This bill is a half-hearted attempt to fix the growing affordability crisis in early childhood education for Australian families. Affordability of early childhood education is in crisis. It's a crisis ignored by the Morrison government and a crisis which is putting pressure on Australian families. This bill is just fiddling around the edges, and it goes nowhere near the reforms that families need to access the high-quality early learning system that they are absolutely deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again this government has offered nothing to support the hardworking and dedicated early childhood educators who are absolutely at the heart of this system. There is nothing for transparency to ensure the additional funding will actually go towards supporting high-quality education programs and nothing to ensure that any additional funding will go to the workforce. There is nothing to protect their hours and their pay, which have been so hard hit during this COVID crisis. This bill is the government's cynical attempt to save face with the women of Australia, and it shows that this government remains woefully out of touch with the experience of working people raising families, out of touch with families who are paying some of the highest fees anywhere in the world, out of touch with the families who are struggling to access the early learning that they need and out of touch with all of those families who are struggling to balance work and family in a system that is overly complicated and, fundamentally, in crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this bill, the government is saying, 'We will ease some of these costs but only for some families, only for a short time and only if you have more than one child in child care.' Let's imagine a family with two children in an early learning service aged one and four. That family can expect to be paying childcare fees for five years for each child. Only three of those years will be while both children are in care. For those three years, this bill will only reduce the fees for one of the children. This is a pittance. They aren't really serious about addressing this crisis. This is penny pinching. It's something made up on the run to look good for a photo-op in an early learning service, but it doesn't look good when you're doing the family budget. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is penny pinching at the expense of the children and families increasingly locked out of the early learning that they need. Now more than ever families need a system that is simple, one that they can rely on. This bill does nothing to provide certainty to thousands of families who are affected by the Morrison lockdowns. Families have been required to pay fees while their children can't attend servicesâ€”families who are doing the right thing and staying at home to protect the health of the community, families who are scrambling to find the money for fees when they've lost hours, jobs or disaster payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, the minister could support these families by giving them one less thing to worry about. He can decide at any time to allow services to waive parent fees and give them the financial break that they need. He can decide to give early learning services the certainty that they need to keep their doors open. He can decide to protect educators' wages and their hours while they continue to work to support children during this pandemic. Instead, every lockdown announcement means families are left wondering what they will have to pay and whether they can afford to pay it. Services are left wondering if enrolments will plummet as a result or if they can in fact remain viable. Educators are left wondering if they will have the hours they need to support their own families. Families in Greater Sydney were forced to wait two weeks into the lockdown before the minister confirmed services would be allowed to waive parent fees. Families in other lockdown states, including my state of Victoria, missed out altogether. This government needs to do its job and give parents, services and educators the certainty that they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear in the face of extended lockdowns that the childhood sector cannot afford to sustain parental fee waivers without government support. But, once again, this government are simply not willing to step up and do what is needed. This government are straight out of the 1950s when it comes to this sector. They are yet to realise that almost a million families rely on early education to support them to return to work. They are yet to realise that over 1.3 million children benefit from high-quality early learning. They are yet to realise that this is a sector that employs 200,000 Australiansâ€”200,000 educators and teachers. The minister knows what needs to be done, but he is simply not doing it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Prime Minister had done his job and delivered a speedy rollout of the vaccine and a purpose-built quarantine system we wouldn't be in this situation. Instead, parents are forced to continue to find the money to pay fees for early learning that they just can't access and the services who can waive parent fees are left wondering how long they can afford to do so. This government has failed to act yet again, and we have to ask: who is left to bear the brunt of its inaction this time? It is the hardworking and dedicated early childhood educators and teachers. The longer this government fails to act, the more hours and income these educators will lose as their services struggle. But the government, as we know, has shown absolutely no regard for the early childhood educators of Australia. This is the government that made the extraordinary decision to kick this workforce off JobKeeper last year, long before anyone else.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, every day of this pandemic, educators have continued to work and support children and families in really difficult circumstances. They have turned up each and every day, despite the risk to their personal health, despite increased workload and stress, despite the constant risk that their hours could be cut and despite the fact that social distancing is impossible in an early learning centre. They have turned up because they know that the children and the families of Australia need them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time that the Morrison government recognised that, too. Instead, educators across the country are still faced with loss of hours and loss of income as a result of the government's refusal to act and to properly fund the sector through this crisis. Early educators are already at breaking point, and this pandemic has only further exposed a problem that was already there. Educators are exhausted, undervalued and leaving the sector at record levels. A report released today by the United Workers Union reveals that 37 per cent of early educators are planning to leave the sector. That's around 70,000 educators who will leave, when the sector needs an additional 40,000 educators to meet demand just in the next couple of years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">COVID has been the breaking point for thousands of Australian educators. Educators are leaving. They are saying, 'Enough is enough.' When educators leave, parents and children miss out on accessing the early learning that they need. There is simply no early learning, no critical development in those early years, without dedicated, hardworking, professional early childhood educators. This crisis will only get worse while this government fails to do its job and support families, support services and support our early childhood educators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's amendment will give families and the early childhood sector the certainty they need by taking the decision out of the minister's hands. Our amendment makes an automatic exemption from charging families gap fees as soon as the state or territory government declares a lockdown. As soon as a lockdown is announcedâ€”not two weeks in and not a month in but as soon as it is announcedâ€”families and services will know what to expect. They'll have the certainty they need. Families will know that they can keep their children home in the interests of their health and wellbeing. They can do that instead of worrying about fees. It will keep services open for the children and the families who need them, making sure this essential service doesn't just survive the crisis but is there to help power our recovery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor knows the real value of early childhood education. We know that it's an essential service that not only supports working families but is critical to supporting the early development of children. It is an investment in the future prosperity of our nation. We have a vision for an early learning sector that is high quality and simple, that families can rely on and that truly values professional educators at its heart. Our child care for working families plan will see fees reduced for all children and families for longer. No child should miss out on the benefits that quality early childhood education can deliver because of high fees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor, that family of two that I mentioned earlier would pay lower fees the whole time their children are accessing early learning, not just for a few years and not just for one child. Labor's plan will increase the base subsidy for all children to 90 per cent for the whole time that they are using the service. Unlike this bill, Labor's plan does not differentiate on the size of a family. It has no age cut-off, and it will apply to all children using outside-of-school-hours care during primary school. As a result, over 86 per cent, 850,000 families, would be better off under Labor's policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is also committed to ensuring early educators are not left behind. These are our frontline workers, but they are underpaid and undervalued. We are determined to repay them for their essential work during this crisis. We know their value to families, we know their value to children and we know their value to our society and our community. That's why we're committed to building an early childhood education sector for the futureâ€”one that children, families and educators can rely on in a crisis and in recovery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Early learning is critical to the future success of our children and our economy. This sector deserves a real plan for the future, not half-hearted platitudes like this. This government does not value early learning, and it doesn't value our early educators. It's clear from this half-baked bill, which doesn't address affordability for most families in the long term. It's clear when they kick early educators off JobKeeper. It's clear, when government members say that early learning is 'outsourcing parenting', that the Morrison government is woefully out of touch with how modern families operate today, and this government is woefully selling our children and our economy short.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike this government, Labor knows the life-changing impact of early learning. We know that the first five years are the most crucial time in a child's development. We know that early learning is one of the best investments that we can make for the future. Only Labor has a vision for a world-class early learning sector with educators, respected and valued, at the heart of that systemâ€”an early learning sector that every working family can rely on; a sector where every child can access the early learning that they need to grow and to thrive.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="245212" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:55</span>):  I just wanted to briefly explain to the chamber why I will not be supporting the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Subsidy) Bill 2021. In doing so, I want to make three quick points. First, I do support funding for child care. I do support helping families who would otherwise struggle to look after their own children or make decisions to go to work, and I do think we should support families on low to middle incomes to do that. We already do, of course, provide substantial assistance to low-income families. Up to 85 per cent of childcare costs are covered for families on lower incomes and, with a sliding scale, on over $180,000 or thereabouts. This bill, though, would of course remove caps for families on very high incomesâ€”above-average incomes of nearly $200,000 a year. I will come back to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The main issue I have, though, is not necessarily the change in this bill itself. The second point I would like to make is more that, if we have $1.7 billion to allocate to support families, it seems completely out of whack and out of balance to me that we cannot find any assistance for those families who decide to look after their own children. As I say, I support families and want to support families who make the choice to work and therefore have to provide and pay for child care for their young children, but there are, of course, families who make the decision for one or other of the parents, or sometimes both, in combination, to look after their own children. We should support that choice as well. We should support parents in any choice as to what is best for their own children, because I do want to say that those mothers and fathers who look after their own children at home are often ignored in this debate. I don't like calling them stay-at-home parents. They are work-at-home parents; I know that. My wife, for a long time, did work at home, looking after our children. She's back working a little bit at the moment, but she works a lot harder than I do in this job. She was working at home, and others were working at home, looking after kids, long before it was cool, during the coronavirus, and they have not been recognised adequately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say here that I recognise the effort they put in, and I think it was summed up in a quote that's attributed to CS Lewis: 'The homemaker has the ultimate career. All other careers exist for one purpose only, and that is to support the ultimate career.' And that is exactly right. The point CS Lewis was making was that our defence forces are there to defend the home. Our businesses are there to make wealth to support the home and the education of the children in the home. It's ultimately, then, the homemakerâ€”the person who is looking after the home, supporting children and raising a familyâ€”who has the ultimate career, because all other careers are just there to help them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I often say my job as a senator is very important, but it pales into insignificance compared to my job as a father and a husband, and likewise for my wife. That is the most important job any of us can do, yet it is barely recognised in our tax or welfare system. It is barely recognised because, today, if you make that choice, to look after your own children, you are massively penalised by our tax system, which only looks at the individual and does not look at the household choices that families make. I make decisions with my wife as a team. We are a team. I'm not sure if my kids are on that team half the time, but we are on the same team. We are working together, yet the tax system treats us as two completely separate entities. When we had young kids, if we'd made a choice for my wife to go back to work we would have been much further ahead because the tax system would have supported us. We would have had two tax-free thresholds. It would have made an enormous financial difference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll put that difference into stark terms. Right now, let's say there are two families. One is a double-income family on $150 grand a year. That sounds like a lot of money, but the average full-time wage today is nearly $80,000, so $150 grand a year is not unusual for a household with two incomes to be on. Let's split that, with $100,000 a year coming from one parent and $50,000 a year from another. They pay, under our tax system, roughly $32,000 in tax. They would receive, roughly, another $7,000 or so in childcare subsidies. That has to be estimated. I've assumed three days a week at $10.40 an hour, the prescribed rate. In total, when you net off those childcare subsidies, their tax bill comes in at $25,000 a year for a household income of $150,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We then have a different family, a single-income family, that says: 'Look, one parent is going to go out and earn the money. They're going to work a bit harder, maybe work longer hours, and they're going to earn $150 grand, and the other parent is not going to earn anything but is going to stay at home and look after our child.' They will have exactly the same income as the other family, but their tax bill will be $43,000 a year. They of course get no childcare subsidies because they're not using it, so their tax is $43,000 a year. The difference between those two families is nearly $18,000 in net tax per year. They have exactly the same household income of $150,000 a yearâ€”a little bit above average, but it's not unusual for households to be on that amount of income todayâ€”and yet the difference in tax is nearly $18,000 a year. That is completely out of whack. It is grossly unfair and, of course, it ultimately distorts the decisions parents make about their children and the raising of their children, because it is a very, very costly choice to look after your own children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the contribution of the previous speaker, who said it's really important that we support the education of young children. I couldn't agree more. Absolutely it's very important, yet all the evidence shows, especially for children under the age of one, that if a parentâ€”a mother or fatherâ€”can spend more time with them it makes an enormous difference in their development. That is not me speaking. OECD reports and psychological studies have all shown that the more time a child under one can spend with their biological mother or father, the better it is for their development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why aren't we doing anything, with these arrangements, to support the child? Isn't that what it should be about? As I said at the start, I do support helping parents who want to go back to work, helping them to put their children in child care, and I hear a lot about that in these debates, but I hear very little about the child. In a childcare bill, shouldn't our children be front and centre of what we are trying to do? That is another reason why we should be seeking a more neutral outcome in this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My final point is this. I don't have a fundamental objection to supporting families more. I do think, though, that families that are on over $200,000 a year, who this bill helps to support, shouldn't be at the front of the queue for government assistance. If you are lucky enough to have a household income of that kind of amountâ€”I'm in that categoryâ€”and you decide to bring a child into the world, I think, primarily, it should be your responsibility to look after that child. There is some government assistance there, but I don't support the idea that through this legislation we would now spend another $1.7 billion on the richest people in our communityâ€”the absolute top few per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill only helps out those few who are in the absolute top few per cent, like us. This bill's for us, by the way. We'll all benefit from this bill, but not people in single-income families on $80,000, $90,000 or $110,000 a year. They're often at those levels when they're just starting a family. If you're a young family, you might not be earning a lot of money. We're not doing anything for them. I know so many families who would love to spend more time with their children when they are young, and they are not necessarily earning high incomes yet. We are not doing anything to help and support those choices, yet we are helping out the very lucky few that are very rich. For that reason, I'm sorry, I cannot support this legislation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:04</span>):  [by video link] I would like to make a contribution to the debate on the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Subsidy) Bill 2021. The bill implements the Morrison government's amendments to the childcare subsidy that were announced as part of their budget this year. Their announcement of this policy was, as per usual, full of spin, because their changes not only have been squashed by the data analysis; they don't even come into effect until July next year. That's right: families will have to wait almost 12 months before they see the benefit of the Morrison government's plan. Families are struggling right now to pay rising costs of childcare fees, and this bill will offer them little consolation. They will have to wait too long and it will help out only a small number of people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also does not address the problem currently facing thousands of families who are currently in lockdown and are having to pay the gap fees. Whilst many families are under stay-at-home orders across the country, childcare centres have remained open as essential services for essential workers. However, families staying at home have still been charged gap fees by the centres, as they are legally required to levy the fees. The minister has the ability to give centres an exemption from charging gap fees and did so for Sydney childcare centres two weeks into their lockdown. However, the government has yet to grant exemptions again for other lockdowns, which have since been endured and are likely to continue because of their failure to administer a timely rollout of vaccinations across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why Labor moved a second reading amendment in the other place to take out the exemption to the minister's rule and put it in the act, so there is an automatic exemption from charging gap fees as soon as a lockdown is declared. But like in March, the Morrison government has voted this down again. It is a deliberate decision of this government to slug families with additional fees throughout what is already a very difficult time. While we're having to deal with the completely bungled vaccine rollout and Mr Morrison's refusal to build purpose-built quarantine sites, lockdowns are going to continue. By voting against the amendment, he was clearly telling families that they will have to continue to pay the gap fees for child care they're not receiving.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Parents need a real plan on child care. Not only will it help the pockets of Australians; it will boost participation in our economy. Under the current agenda, the Liberals have a broken system, and fiddling with the childcare subsidy, as this bill does, will not fix the problem. There are two schedules to the bill. The first will remove the annual cap from the family assistance law so that there will no longer be a limit on the amount of childcare subsidy that families over a specified income can receive each year. The second schedule will increase the rate of childcare subsidy by 30 per cent for second and subsequent children aged five and under up until a maximum rate of 95 per cent. However, as soon as the second child is six and starts to go to school, this support will be ripped away, despite the fact that they may be in before- or after-school care. So whether they're in after-school care or before-school care, it is still going to be ripped away from them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, Labor's plan for cheaper child care will assist more families and for a longer period of time. Our policy accommodates families of all sizes, does not have age restrictions and applies to all children using outside school hour care during primary schoolâ€”and, not only that; there is data to back it up. Analysis of the Parliamentary Budget Office's modelling shows that 86 per cent of families are better off under Labor's policy, while a mere eight per cent of families are better off under the Liberal's system. We wouldn't mind if they just took our policy and implemented it, because, after all, we want to ensure that families benefit. There is really no comparison. Our policy works and it will work for a significant number of more Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we will support the bill, it's important to note the stark contrast to what we would provide. Also, as I said earlier, this bill will be of no support to families who are currently in lockdown or inevitably will be in the coming months as we struggle to contain the delta variant and deal with Mr Morrison's bungled rollout of the vaccine. This has not, however, stopped the Morrison government from praising themselves for providing better assistance to families with three children in child care at once. The bill may do this, but it will only help the 1.8 per centâ€”less than two per centâ€”of families who have three children under the age of six. What about the other 98 per cent?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Childcare fees and costs are out of control under the Morrison government and Australian families are paying more out-of-pocket costs for child care than ever before. Since the Liberals were elected in 2013, childcare fees have risen by a whopping 36 per cent. In my home city of Launceston, over the past 12 months local childcare fees have risen by a staggering 4.1 per cent, well above the national average of 2.4 per cent and substantially exceeding inflation. The childcare subsidy is pegged to inflation and means that families in Launceston and throughout Tasmania are paying more out-of-pocket costs for child care. This is all at a time when wages have been stagnant, and who knows what's going to happen in the future? We know that casualisation of our workforce is causing insecurity for people. Clearly, the system is broken and Mr Morrison has failed families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Data from the Productivity Commission's report on government services, released this year, shows that the high cost of child care is a barrier to parents, particularly women, entering the workforce. It makes no sense for a parent to work if it is only going to just pay for the child care. Parents should be encouraged to work if they want to and they should not be held back by exorbitant childcare fees. Joining the workforce will boost our participation rate and have a positive flow-on effect on the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a report by UNICEF, which is additional evidence that the Morrison government is failing Australian families. The report, titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Where do rich countries stand on child care</span>, ranks Australia 37th out of 41 countries based on childcare affordability, access, quality and parental leave. The report also found that Australia is one of only eight countries where child care costs parents a quarter of their income. This adds to the mounting evidence that, under this Morrison Liberal government, Australia is falling behind the rest of the world. We are ranked third-last in the OECD for our vaccination rates, our housing market is the third most unaffordable in the world, we are ranked 87th out of 133 countries globally in terms of economic complexity, and our average internet speeds are embarrassingly ranked at 61st. Mr Morrison may be going hard and strong on the Olympic rhetoric recently, but Australia is running last in the race on too many indicators. Our lives should be improving, but under the Liberals we're falling far behind. This tired Morrison government's lousy childcare policy will fall short of what is needed to deliver genuine assistance to Australian families who are struggling with the obscene childcare fees, and it will fail to bring reform to the system that is so desperately needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our plan for child care will deliver for working families and have a meaningful impact. It will scrap the $10,560 childcare subsidy cap, which often sees women losing money from extra days work. It will lift the maximum childcare subsidy rate to 90 per cent, increase childcare subsidy rates and taper them for every family earning less than $530,000. The plan will bring the cost of child care down for all Australian families and better support parents to work the hours they need and that they want to work. As it stands, the second income earner in the family is usually a woman; they should be rewarded for working more hours and contributing to our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On so many fronts the Morrison government have failed Australian families. They are disappointing Australian families and letting those families down. Their track record is abysmal. Although we will support this bill, because something is better than nothing, it will do nothing to aid Australian families at a time when they need a boost. We are seeing lockdown after lockdown because of this government's failure to protect Australian families throughout this country by rolling out vaccines in a timely manner. They are failing aged-care workers. They're failing early childhood educators. They are failing parents. They're failing people with disabilities. Australian families deserve so much more. Australian parents whose children are in those early learning years depend on the Commonwealth government, their federal government, to deliver child care at an affordable rate to support them to enter the workforce again. I call on the government to improve what they've laid out in this bill and support the families who most need it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  It's great to be up here tonight to speak to this bill, the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Subsidy) Bill 2021. Let's just get a couple of things out on the table before I start getting taunts about being a dinosaur and all that sort of stuff. I stayed at home for four years, at my choice, so I could help raise my children. I happily attended mothers groups and things like that. I want to be clear, I'm not talking about kindergarten either. I come from a long line of working mothers. Indeed, my great-great-aunt taught maths and physics at All Hallows' School for 50 years. She had a hall named after her. My grandmother was a teacher who had eight children, four before the war and four after the war. My mother, my wife and my sisters all worked. So this is not an attack on working mothers or anything like that. However, I would like to see greater choice in child care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing I think we've got common ground on is how expensive child care is. I would argue that one of the reasons child care is so expensive is that there is very little choice or competition and very little flexibility in the type of child care that parents can choose. The government now pays the childcare centre directly, rather than the parent, so that removes the choice the parent has. If, for example, they want to have an at-home nanny for three hours a day rather than eight hours a day, they are forced to pay a full day's child care. This just doesn't work for a lot of shift workers, for example. Either they might work early, from six o'clock in the morning through to two, or they might work from two through to 10 or 11 o'clock at night. So it's very difficult to use what I'd call the formalised childcare system if you're a childcare worker.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Likewise, if you come from a regional part of Australia where you're out on a farm and the nearest town is 40 kilometres away, are you really going to spend half an hour to 40 minutes driving into town and then driving back to the farm, only to have to waste another hour and a half going back five or six hours later? Farmers just don't have the time to drop off their children at child care. Why would they? I grew up on a farm and I've got great memories of hanging out with my dad in a big old Bedford truck when I was a child. However, having said that, I did go to kindergarten. My dad was the president of the kindergarten for four years before going on and being the president of the P&amp;F.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My problem with this bill is that it continues the arms race whereby the more we increase childcare subsidies, the higher childcare fees go. I'm not convinced that parents and children are getting better outcomes out of it. Twenty years ago we spent, I think, about $500 million on child care. Today we spend over $10 billion. I'm not sure that parents get greater choice or greater flexibility in the type of child care that they get. The other thing I'd like to point out too is that the cost of child care for low-income earners hardly makes it worth the low-income earners going to work. I've got different numbers here, but it looks like it's somewhere between $15,000 to $20,000 per child.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ASKEW</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  Tonight I'm going to speak about two important initiatives: Australia's national action plan for pain management and Painaustralia's updated National Pain Services Directory. Both were launched recently at a parliamentary friends of pain management event here in Canberra. Minister for Health, Greg Hunt, said at the launch, 'Chronic pain is something which can be agonising and debilitating. It can have an impact on mental health. It can simply impair one's life in the most devastating of ways.' Like Minister Hunt, my hope is that the national strategic action plan will give a sense of hope to the almost 3.4 million Australians who live with chronic pain each and every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of those Australians injured in a serious accident nearly three years ago, and well known to many in this building, recently sent me a message, after her first visit to the Launceston pain management centre, saying: 'Thank you so much. My appointment yesterday has opened up so many more options than I ever even knew I had.' She went on to finish with: 'I can't believe all the options there are once you talk to the right people.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Painaustralia was tasked with developing the National Strategic Action Plan for Pain Management with financial support from the Australian government. The resulting action plan lays out a national approach towards support for chronic pain management and has been endorsed by health ministers from every state and territory. The National Strategic Action Plan for Pain Management outlines the key actions Australians should take to tackle chronic pain, including managing pain through holistic methods. The plan recommends eight goals that focus on reducing the burden of disease, improving the quality of life and care for patients, educating Australians on understanding and managing pain and supporting health practitioners to deliver the best treatment and care for pain patients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government has provided $2.5 million for early implementation of this plan, including funding to educate and train health professionals in offering effective pain management care, as well as providing further funding to Painaustralia for consumer education and awareness programs. As one of those 3.4 million people living with chronic pain, author, advocate and Painaustralia pain champion Tara Moss described how pain restricts her activity and impacts her day-to-day life. Tara was diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome after an injury five years ago. She described how her condition was invisible, but explained, 'Pain is invisible, but the fact that it is invisible does not mean it's not here.' Tara said that 'Living with CRPS is a daily mountain I need to climb and the pathways change all the time. Some days I might make it to the top of that mountain, but frequently I never make it out of base camp or I might not make it out of my bedclothes. That's the reality of living with chronic pain.' She's a great advocate. Like Tara, the Australians who live with chronic pain know how it can determine whether they can go ahead with their plans for the day or whether those plans will have to be put off until a time when their pain is more manageable. They know how chronic pain impacts their work, health, sleep and relationships as well as creating flow-on effect for their families, carers, friends, colleagues and their wider communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the Parliamentary Friends of Pain Management Group, my co-chair, and ACT local, David Smith, and I have worked hard to raise the awareness of chronic pain and managing that pain, both here in parliament and within our own communities. Our group works to help health professionals access pain management education and training as well as reduce the discrimination, misunderstanding and stigmatisation of people living with chronic pain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One pain management initiative the group has promoted is the National Pain Services Directory, which was initially launched in 2019 and updated this year. This new and improved Pain Services Directory contains information on services offered by more than 200 facilities throughout Australia. This directory puts the information about pain management services and facilities in a format that makes it easy for consumers and GPs to find what they need. The directory search function allows people to find clinics by state and territory, by specific geographic location, by pain condition or by whether a public or private facility is needed. It means those living with chronic pain, their carers and medical professionals can make informed decisions around pain management options and pathways located in their regions. Chronic pain costs the Australian economy more than $70 billion each year, but the cost of persistent pain goes beyond economics to quality of life. The updated National Pain Services Directory and the national action plan give us tools and future direction in the support we provide for Australians living with chronic pain. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  I rise today to reflect on the Olympic Games in Tokyo, which finished on Sunday. Like Senator Chandler, I witnessed performances which, as Senator Chandler put it, captured 'the essence of the Olympic spirit'. It's just a shame that Senator Chandler demonstrated the exact opposite in her contributionâ€”to use the word looselyâ€”last week, when she misgendered a transwoman athlete, Laurel Hubbard, and denigrated both her and her qualification to represent her country at an Olympic Games. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The practice of sport is a human right. Every individual must have the possibility of practising sport, without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which requires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Human Rights Commission and Sport Australia hold the same vision for sport. In their<span style="font-style:italic;"> G</span><span style="font-style:italic;">uidelines for the inclusion of transgender and gender diverse people in sport</span>, they state: </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Participation in sport is a human right. We are all born free and equal in dignity and rights.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Chandler would have you believe people affirm their gender identity for the specific purpose of excellence at a sport and to dominate women's sport. Transwomen affirm their gender identity to live as their true selves. They should not lose their human right to participate in any social and cultural practice, such as sport. This so-called trans dominance of women's sport is a myth which people like Senator Chandler use to cause fear, distrust and division in our society. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw at the Tokyo Olympics a number of firsts. Senator Chandler chose to focus her discrimination on one athlete, but there were a number of trans and non-binary athletes competing at the Tokyo Olympics, including Alana Smith and Quinn, a member of the Canadian women's football team. In fact, Quinn became the first trans or non-binary athlete to win a medal at an Olympic games, when the Canadian women's football team beat Sweden to claim the gold medal. Their accomplishments should be celebrated, not denigrated, as Senator Chandler did last week in this place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Chandler has said, the IOC has noted that there is no evidence of an unfair advantage for transwomen over their cisgender counterparts. This is true; there is no evidence of this. There are no studies comparing the performance of transwomen athletes to those of cisgender athletes. As participation in sport is a human right, we should always start from a position of inclusion. The IOC have developed protocols and policies regarding transgender athletes in sport. It is these standards which athletes such as Laurel Hubbard met in order to qualify for these games. She was humble and thankful and showed real courage at her press conference after the competition at the games. Laurel Hubbard exemplifies the Olympic spirit and should be celebrated as an Olympian, without the question mark Senator Chandler and her ilk would seek to put on this status. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This should not have to be continually said, but, for Senator Chandler's benefit, I will state it for the record: transmen are men, transwomen are women and non-binary people are non-binary. Their gender identities are valid, and they should not have to tolerate blatant discrimination, unchallenged, in this place from the likes of Senator Chandler. </span>

It was revealed through questions on notice through estimates that the government issued 11,771 people with a debt notice after a review of their income support payments and any JobKeeper income that was paid to them by their employer. It is unconscionable and frankly outrageous that the government is chasing income support recipients for so-called debts when billionaires collected millions of dollars in JobKeeper while turning significant profits. There is a clear double standard between the individuals receiving income support and businesses who claimed JobKeeper. The government is clearly demonstrating these double standards. I'm certain that the vast majority of those so-called debts will be genuine mistakes in a confusing system, if in fact they are debts at all.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I raised this issue again and again in the COVID committee and at estimates, trying myself to make sense of the system. The government knew that people on both JobSeeker and JobKeeper might receive over-payments. The government says that they were doing checks, and I question how significant and how effectively those checks were carried out. The same agency that was responsible for robodebt, Services Australia, told me they were undertaking a compliance review of so-called high-risk customers. But, with the rate of coronavirus supplement decreasing and the stepping down of JobKeeper, people were confused about the rules and requirements. There were hundreds of thousands of people who were dealing with Centrelink for the first time. It's no wonder there was mass confusion. There are still so many unanswered questions. Did Centrelink do their due diligence and get in touch with every single person they thought might be at high risk? Why weren't the rules clearer? How can we trust the government that was responsible for robodebt to raise debts correctly and fairly? The short answer is we can't.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, the government is allowing big businesses that made huge profits while receiving JobKeeper to keep those funds. When will those billionaires get their debt notices? It is simply unconscionable to allow them to keep the millions when they have made significant profits and when the government has chased people on income support. It is simply a joke for the government to say both JobSeeker and JobKeeper programs had strong compliance frameworks. Clearly they failed. We had huge corporations and exclusive private schools getting millions in payments and they don't have to pay anything back. I simply cannot see why the government can't see why this is nonsense, and apparently they can't be shamed into giving the money back.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, people who are doing it the toughest are the ones that are getting treated this way. People who lost their jobs in the pandemic and who received assistance when they needed it most are now getting a kick in the teeth. If billionaires can keep their JobKeeper payments while making huge profits, then people who sought support during the pandemic and may have made a mistake should not be punished. The government should focus on giving people on income support higher payments to get through the latest lockdown, instead of chasing others, some of whom may be in lockdown. The government couldn't answer that question from me today about whether and how many people that are currently in lockdown have received these notices. People in lockdown right now in New South Wales and Victoria who couldn't find more than eight hours work are living on just $44 a day. They can't afford to pay rent, put food on the table or buy essential items. People are in serious financial distress. They are being pushed to the limit, and what does this government do? It sends them a debt notice. It is unconscionable. The government should write to those people and withdraw those debt notices and send the debt notices to the billionaires, who should be paying back that JobKeeper money out of the profits that they made during the pandemic. I'm not against people making profits. I am against them making profits through JobKeeper.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  [by video link] This evening I raise the case of my constituents Mary-Anne and Billy Hemsley, who live in Curlewis in Geelong, the mother and stepfather of 15-year-old Talia Wale. Talia travelled to Fennell Bay, New South Wales, on 11 July to stay with her aunt for a short holiday at the end of the school holidays. Several days after departing Victoria, a statewide lockdown, that being lockdown No. 5, was imposed across Victoria. Over the past seven weeks, Ms Hemsley has applied for three permits for Talia, who has received a negative COVID-19 test, to enable Talia to return to Victoria, but these applications have been repeatedly denied. As the days and weeks drag on, Ms Hemsley and Talia have become increasingly stressed, anxious and depressed about Talia's forced separation from her family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Late last week, I wrote to Victoria's chief medical officer, Professor Brett Sutton, urgently appealing to him to issue a permit to Talia so she could fly back on a flight booked for last Sunday. I received only an automated reply and no response to my follow-up email. At the time I was assisting the family, a friend of the Hemsley family contacted the office of Bellarine MP Lisa Neville and was advised on the instructions of the MP acting for Ms Neville, who is away ill at the moment, that the Department of Health processes would need to be followed and there was nothing further that could be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given Talia is a minor, a child, only 15 years old, I consider this to be an untenable situation. Talia's mental health was in such decline that yesterday her mum drove to Fennell Bay to be with her daughter. Ms Hemsley has applied for permits for both herself and Talia, but they have not been issued, despite regional Victoria coming out of lockdown No. 6. Section 17 of the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 provides for the protection of the family and the rights of the child. A large body of international and domestic law makes it clear that the rights of the child are absolute. I believe the refusal to provide Talia with a permit to return to her family may constitute a breach of the charter. That's why I'm referring this case to the Victorian Ombudsman, Deborah Glass, who has done a first-class job identifying human rights breaches by the Victorian government under the guise of public health orders and has called them out. She's still waiting for an apology after the shocking incident last year when the public housing tower in Melbourne was locked down with minutes of notice and people were left in their units with no food or medicines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Public health orders are necessary during a pandemic, but they must be proportionate and, during a pandemic, human rights matter alsoâ€”the right not to be locked in your home 24/7, as happened in the northern curfew, the right not to be locked in your house with no food or medicines or support for those with a disability or the right of family and friends to say their final farewell to their child, as in the case of the beautiful Cooper Onyett, who tragically drowned whilst on a school camp hundreds of kilometres from the nearest case of the virus. There was no funeral exemption given, and that was an absolute disgrace. Professor Sutton explained his decision was simply 'a matter of equity', which is incomprehensible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What about today's case and the right of a mother to see her daughter, stricken with cancer? A mother who is fully vaccinated cannot cross the border to be with her daughter with cancer. Last year I advocated for the family who lost their precious 16-year-old to suicide and was told by the most senior departmental health official that an exemption would not be granted because it might be a breach of human rights, which was of course absolute rubbish.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we work together to get through this crisis, I say to the Victorian government: please, do not forget the importance of compassion towards Victorians facing sickness, grief and separation. I am determined to fight for Talia. She must come home. She must return to school. I call on Daniel Andrews to do the right thing and issue her with a permit. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  The United Nations food systems presummit last week in Rome recommended a dietary limit of 14 grams of red meat per person per day. That's one bite. As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I'm appalled, and I'll explain how this is an attack on our farmers and on every Australian. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The presummit recommended the introduction of a worldwide environmental tax on meat of $1.60 per kilo for cattle grazing on pasture, yet not for cattle raised in intensive feedlots. That distinction reflects the influence of large multinational feedlot operators and the lack of influence that family farms have in the UN's eyes. As my colleague Bob Katter rightly pointed out, this UN measure will take 2.4 billion kilos of protein off the market, starving 80 million people of protein. Yes, go the UN! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third recommendation of the food systems presummit is to move food production within reach of population centres and produce whatever protein and nutrition is possible in that region. It's called short chain food supply. We did it 200 years ago. People starved. Nutrition was poor. Life expectancy was less than half what we enjoy today. Then along came long chain food supply, allowing countries like Australia to grow crops to feed and clothe those in need. World hunger fell to less than 10 per cent. The only reason there are still areas of poverty and hunger in 2021 is because of war and civil unrestâ€”you know, the things that the United Nations were supposed to solve. World peace has eluded the UN, yet cows have not. The United Nations is proposing to eliminate global food chains that have brought good food to the world for hundreds of years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently spoke about the false water shortage brought to you thanks to the UN's directive to not build new dams. This is the start of a false food shortage. The motivation is to eliminate broadacre agriculture, eliminate food exports and return all that land to nature. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rural voters will be annoyed to hear that the Morrison government bankrolled this attack on our farming community with a $64 million donation. The Liberal-National government is funding our own demiseâ€”the betrayal and demise of our farmers, of our country. Australian farms employ 326,000 people directly. They contribute $75 billion to the economy and $60 billion to our exports. Without the bush, we'd be stuffed, broke and hungry. These three United Nations proposals will destroy rural Australia, wipe out family farms, crash real estate prices and further hollow out country towns for no benefit to us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no better source of protein than red meat, yet our supermarkets stock protein and fake food products made from crickets. Why? It's because billionaires can't make enough profit out of cattle. It's a variable industry, with good times and bad. Billionaires can, though, make money on intensive cultivation of bugs for protein. This breaks the reliance on nature's weather and allows scheduled production of a food-like substance with great profit margins and low fulfilment costs. This satisfies the UN dictate for short chain supply. The United Nations food and agriculture organisation is literally directing the replacement of red meat with bug protein. Sceptics can even attend one of the regular UN bug tastings, where journalists are encouraged to extoll the virtues of bug cuisine. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CSIRO has fallen in line behind the UN, publishing a 64-page love letter on the delights of eating bugs entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Edible insects: a roadmap for the strategic growth of an emerging Australian industry</span>. Looking through the glossy pages, we see that the CSIRO advocates our future should include insect milkshakes, bug ice-cream and granola bars made from dried cockroaches. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not making any of this up. It's real. This is happening, and we taxpayers are paying for it thanks to the Morrison-Joyce government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those who think they're eating an environmentally friendly product, think again A fake hamburger patty using plant or bug protein contains 20 chemicals found in pet food. That's all the UN and their quislings in our federal government think the public deserve: pet food. How does it make sense to grow good food and, instead of eating that food, feed it to crickets and then eat the crickets? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fellow Australians, there is no protein shortage. There will be, though, if the UN succeeds in wiping out red meat production so that they can hand the protein industry over to their big business, corporate partners. One Nation rejects this attack on our farming community. We reject state and federal parliaments around our country continuing to demonise and isolate farmers. We will continue to oppose the UN dictating to federal and state governments. One Nation will continue to oppose ideology over humanity. We will continue to stand up for a fair society based on a citizen's right to exercise free choice about diet, health and business. We have one flag. We are one community. We are one sovereign nation. It's time to withdraw from the United Nations.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  Annastacia Palaszczuk and Queensland Labor continue to fail Queensland farmers. First, they made the decision to destroy Paradise Dam, in what is Australia's greatest infrastructure fail. They have refused to even consider repairing the wall to the full height, leaving farmers high and dry, and now they have no plan for water security in the Wide Bay-Burnett region, again kicking the region's farmers right in the guts. You just have to ask Tom Marland from Marland Law, who's running the legal action against the Queensland government, as to how low this government has gone. The farmers who once relied on Paradise Dam are almost down and out. Meanwhile Queensland Labor have the audacity to rub lies in their face by refusing to tell the truth about any future plans for the region. These farmers have battled drought, fire, flood and, in some cases, pestilence, yet the reprehensible actions of Queensland Labor have reduced water allocation to as low as 16 per cent, crippling the farmers' ability to produce crops in the coming seasons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If this were not dire enough, the Queensland water minister showed his true colours last week when he was asked how the Queensland government intended to assist farmers with reduced water allocations. Glenn Butcher, who is the minister in question, said that he was expecting greater rainfall this year. So there it is, folks: Queensland Labor's solution to the drought situation in Queensland, to the lack of dam building in Queensland, is that their water minister is going to do, basically, a rain dance. He's going to put on a grass skirt and a coconut brassiere and shillyshally all around George Street, hoping that it's going to rain in Queensland. He's not going to build dams. He's not going to rebuild Paradise Dam. He's going to act like some deranged feral minion, dancing all around the place and hoping it rains. Minister, two-thirds of Queensland is in drought. Your government's actions in the Wide Bay-Burnett region have effectively let loose a neutron bomb of $2.5 billion worth of damage to the economy. Instead of sitting down with the community in the Wide Bay-Burnett region and talking about how to rebuild the dam wall, the Queensland Labor government just want to go and play politics. I say, 'Shame on them.' This is destroying people's lives. It's destroying the lives of farmers and it's destroying the lives of those in the towns in the Wide Bay-Burnett area.</span>

Your mates in state Labor are refusing to build dams in Queensland because they hate rural Queenslanders, they hate those people on the land. The only way state Labor ever get into power is by sucking up to the Greens, because they know they can only get into power with the Greens' preferences. No dams are ever going to be built in Queensland while Palaszczuk remains Premier, especially with this shillyshallying, rain-dancing water minister who believes the answer to water security in Queensland is not building dams but pretending he's some sort of shaman and dancing around the place.</span>

I say to everybody: only the Liberal National Party believe in dams and only the Liberal National Party want to build dams in Queensland. We say to state Labor: 'Stop playing politics. Do the right thing by the people of Queensland and build dams. Be on the side of the farmers.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk first about the rights of LGBTIQA+ people here in Australia to be free from discrimination and particularly how damaging the approach in tonight's census has been for LGBTIQA+ communities. By not asking the right questions, the census is erasing the identities of queer people. Nathan Anastasi is a trans man who spoke to the ABC about what the gap in the census means to him. He said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I've been excluded. For me, the census is the biggest data collection that occurs in this country and, so, it should be designed to include a collection of data on all Australians â€¦</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ the Australian Bureau of Statistics will collect a whole heap of data about my personal life â€“ how much I earn, my religious affiliation and even my history of chronic health conditions. But they won't learn about something that's important to the picture of who I am â€“ my sexual orientation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In fact, once again, lesbian, gay, transgender, intersex and queer people won't be properly counted in this year's census, because the ABS and the responsible minister â€“ Michael Sukkar â€“ failed to add in questions about sexual orientation, gender identity or variations in sex characteristics.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This erasure hurts every individual member of our LGBTIQA+ communities. And this erasure flows on to policymaking, as the Australian LGBTIQA+ community census declaration noted in the their powerful statement:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We condemn the 2021 Census for continuing to render LGBTIQA+ Australians invisible and to make it harder to address the stigma, discrimination and lack of services we experience.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We call on the Federal Government to commit to following its own guidelines on recognition of sex and gender by including in the 2026 Census the best practice questions already developed in consultation with the LGBTIQA+ community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has already promised to introduce a religious discrimination bill by the end of the year, and when the census is done we will have detailed data on the religion of every person who chooses to answer that question. But for LGBTIQA+ people there is no question in this year's census that enables them to make their voice count. Equality is not negotiable, and we fight the stigma and discrimination that, tragically, LGBTIQA+ communities still experience.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week marked the second anniversary of Kashmir's loss of its special-autonomy status, and the Australian Greens share the grief and sorrow of activists around the world at the ongoing tragedy of human rights abuses in Kashmir. From well before 2019 we've seen very serious human rights abuses in Kashmir. We've seen a communications blackout, which is an incredibly serious violation of Kashmiris' human rights. We've seen weapons fired at crowdsâ€”incredibly dangerous and a fundamental attack on freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. There have been extrajudicial killings. The Indian government's security forces in Kashmir have operated with impunity and are not being held accountable due to special protections in law. Worse than that, the Indian government's actions have been compounded during the COVID-19 crisis. Kashmir was not provided with resources to respond to COVID-19 and had fewer doctors and ICU beds than other regions of India. Many prisoners who should have been released were held for political reasons and placed at increased risk of COVID.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The attacks on human rights are horrifying and they must stop. We call on the Australian government to do everything it can to directly raise the issue of human rights internationally, both bilaterally and multilaterally, including with the Indian government. This is something I've raised multiple times here, and I will continue to do so. Most importantly, we call for the full right for self-determination for the people of Kashmir, as a fundamental human right both under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  [by video link] Every person in this country should be absolutely ashamed that the so-called Prime Minister of this countryâ€”a man absolutely committed to not doing his jobâ€”today refused to commit to a target of net zero emissions by 2050. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Sixth assessment report of the Inte</span><span style="font-style:italic;">rgovernmental Panel on Climate C</span><span style="font-style:italic;">hange</span> tells us that First Nations knowledge is a vital tool in the struggle for climate justice. First Nations people have cared for and protected our lands and waters, including our totems, for tens of thousands of years. Recent breakdowns of ecological systems and harms to biodiversity have been linked to a disregard for traditional forms of land management and their displacement by imported and harmful practices. The IPCC report acknowledges the contribution of First Nations people and First Nations scientists in helping record historical as well as current observations of a changing climate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The year before last, we watched this country burn as we experienced one of the worst bushfire seasons in our recorded history, and what did the so-called Prime Minister do? He took a holiday to Hawaii! He doesn't hold a hose, mate. He went missing when it was time to get this country vaccinated. Whatâ€”and he doesn't hold a needle, mate? Today, when the IPCC recommended urgent action, he's gone missing again. Where is he? Get him out from under that desk! He just has no idea, mate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to get rid of the Morrison government. We can kick the Liberals out and put the Greens in, with the balance of power. Greens with the balance of power would mean that the Greens and our advocacy for black justice and climate justice in the parliament could not be ignored. It would mean that our people-powered movement would need to be consulted on all laws before this place. Imagine that! Look at the Greens' policies and see what we stand for. We leave the rest for dead. This way we can make laws that are good for the people and for the country. With the balance of power, the Greens will push the next government to go harder and faster on climate change. If we get a Labor governmentâ€”they don't even know what their target is and they're still getting donations from the fossil fuel industryâ€”they're going to need a true party that will hold them to account, and the only way we're going to do that is with the balance of power. The last time the Greens and Labor were in shared power, we passed laws to bring down pollution. Yes, we did. Coal and gas are causing the greatest damage to people, country and communities because Labor and the Liberals are being bought off by the coal and gas corporations. Seriously, you guys, stop taking their money, because when you take their money you have to do their work.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens don't take dirty donations, so, with the balance of power, we will make big corporations and billionaires finally contribute their fair share of tax so that we can all live a better life. Right now, we live in a society where a nurse pays more tax than a multibillion-dollar corporation. What the hell? My politicsâ€”green politicsâ€”is the politics of hope. We dare to plant a seed and make these big, bold, visionary plans come true. Right now, we have a chance to build a country that works for everyone, not just the chosen few. My promise to the people of Victoria is that only the Greens will fight for your future.</span>

That science has been like a lighthouse guiding us through a decades-long smokescreen put up by the fossil fuel industry and their lackeys in governments all around the world. It's been a tough day for the many people who care about our planet and care about future generations, following the release of that report. The reality is hitting home. The report is from some of the world's best scientists, over 200 of them, a very conservative bunch who used consensus decision-making to provide their report. The reality of this hitting home has been difficult for many people to comprehend, because for so long nowâ€”indeed, for decadesâ€”so many people have been campaigning for climate action, and yet here we are in 2021 having the same debates. It's been especially frustrating for people today witnessing the government's continued indifference to the climate emergency.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had thought it was a tough day for me until I got a message tonight from Helen Taylor. She is the mother of one very special young Australian who I'd like to acknowledge tonight in the Australian Senateâ€”a young fella, a climate activist who had a firecracker for a heart, who dedicated his short life to taking action on our climate crisis. He was riding his bike around the country to raise awareness of the need for climate actionâ€”another young person galvanised, riding and having conversations with anyone and everyone to change the world. His name was Leif Justham. He popped in to meet me in my electorate office in Launceston this summer, but, sadly, I was away. I heard he had a fantastic meeting with some of my staff, who, of course, were blown away by the energy and commitment of this young fella. He died only a few months ago, riding his bike across the Nullarbor. Leif was just 21â€”the same age as my sonâ€”when he was, tragically, hit by a truck. At his funeral, his family said Leif was a passionate lover of the planet and all life that came from it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to dedicate this speech to Leif and his mum, Helen Taylor, who reached out to me today. She wanted to thank me and my colleagues for the work that we'd done on fighting for climate action for so long. She told me it was Leif's birthday this weekend and he would appreciate the work that we do and everything we fight for. If people want to know more about Leif, they can go to www.leifjustham.com. There's a collection of information there about his life work. Or you could check out 'Change Your Super', which was one of the many causes that Leif was campaigning on, to get people to use their investments and try to channel that into climate action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to do a few things tonight. I wanted to start, after acknowledging Leif and his mum Helen, by also acknowledging the many climate scientistsâ€”indeed, all our scientists, but especially climate scientists tonightâ€”on this day that we've received the IPCC report. It can't be easy being a climate scientist; it really can't be. They spend so much of their time looking at a subject that is so difficult for many people to comprehend and that delivers so much bad news. As reported in <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra Times</span> recently, dozens of Australian scientists have also been targeted by vicious, unrelenting campaigns because of their work. They're often ignored, they're censored and they are politicised. According to a survey conducted in 2020, more than half of the environmental scientists working for the Australian federal government and state governments reported having been prohibited from communicating scientific information. Some respondents said that they had suffered negative health impacts after having their work suppressed and others reported that their career advancement was stifled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank those scientists for all the work they've doneâ€”not just the hundreds that contributed to this report with the IPCC, but all the scientists out there that do this work. We can go home to our families and to our lives, but they have to see this every day. They've committed their life to giving us a better understanding of what we need to do as decision-makers, as leaders, in a place like this where we have a platform and a privilege to change things. I wanted to honour them tonight for all the hard work that they've done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's well and truly justified to say that this IPCC report is the most important report in our time. It has laid out the facts: that in just 5Â½ years time the world collectively will have spent its carbon budget; that in 5Â½ years time we will be on track to exceed 1.5 degree warming; and that, by 2030, we will have reached a tipping point 10 years earlier than our best climate models had previously forecasted. If that is the case, and that is what the best scientists tell us, then we have got 5Â½ years to turn this ship around. That means that we simply cannot afford to have a government in power in this country or anywhere else that continues to ignore the science and that puts the environment and future generations of this country at risk. I would argue that, if this is one of the most important reports in human history, this next federal election is, without a doubt, the most important federal election in our nation's history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd say to all those Australians out there today who are despairing, who are angry, who are frustrated and who are anxious: action is the best antidote to despair. There are lots of things you can do to take action. You could be like Leif and decide that you're going to do something with your life to change the world. You can do small things. You can change the way you live. You can electrify your transport. You can get renewables for your home power. You can do lots of things to reduce your carbon footprint. That all matters. But, at the end of the day, we have to change a broken system, a broken political system, a broken economic systemâ€”that nexus between political donations and special interests that keeps us locked into this cynical, death spiral that this planet is in now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most important action that any Australian can take is to vote for change. Vote for the change you want to see in the world. Your vote is powerful. Do not believe that your vote isn't powerful. Voting for change is the most important thing you can do, because one of the only things politicians will listen to is votes. Vote for the change you want to see in the world. I am proud to be in a party that has, for 40 years now in this place, campaigned for climate action. We have never relented, nor will we ever. The Greens could hold the balance of power in this government in the 47th Parliament. Vote for it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:10</span>):  I rise to speak about the prosecution in the ACT courts of barrister and former Attorney-General of the ACT Bernard Collaery. The prosecution has proved very controversial for two reasons. The first is that the matter involves four charges of contravening section 39 of the Intelligence Services Actâ€”that is, unauthorised communications of information relating the Australian Secret Intelligence Serviceâ€”and one count of conspiring to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The information in question relates to ASIS spying on Timor-Leste. Before and after a round of negotiations relating to the proposed maritime boundary between Timor-Leste and Australia took place in Dili, from 24 to 27 October 2004, Prime Minister Alkatiri and Secretary of State Jose Teixeira outlined to their cabinet colleagues the negotiating position of Timor-Leste and the importance of the issue affecting their country. The Australian government arranged for these cabinet discussions to be clandestinely monitored by listening devices surreptitiously and unlawfully placed by ASIS in the Timor-Leste government's cabinet meeting room. Working closely with elements of the Australian Embassy in Dili, ASIS recorded and transcribed the Timor government's internal deliberations. This enabled the Australian negotiating team to become aware of the private discussions of the Timor-Leste negotiating team and its position in relation to various issues arising in connection with the negotiation of what became the 2006 Treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea, signed by Australia and Timor-Leste.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is scandalous and un-Australian that we would spy on a new, independent neighbourâ€”the newest country in the world, an impoverished country and one that gave great assistance to Australian forces in World War IIâ€”in circumstances where we had agreed to negotiate with them in good faith. That someone who called out this immoral conduct is now being prosecuted for blowing the whistle is unconscionable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second reason for the controversial nature of Mr Collaery's trial is that muchâ€”indeed, almost allâ€”of the proceedings are taking place in strict secrecy. In this country we have a system of open justice. Someone passing by a court should be able to wander in and hear what the charges are, what evidence has been laid out by the prosecution, what the witnesses have to say, what the defence's evidence is and what he or she may have to say. Importantly, an open court allows the public to keep an eye on the judge as well. Open courts go to the community's confidence in the courts, and the courts must be rooted in that confidence. Sadly, this trial is taking place behind closed doorsâ€”or at least it will unless the full bench of the ACT Supreme Court reverses the decision of Justice Mossop to close the court.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what's it all about? Australians do have a right to know. As mentioned in my opening remarks, in the context of good faith negotiations, Australia spied on Timor-Leste in 2004. That's the first and dominant reason the Commonwealth want to close the courtâ€”they don't want to admit to the spying operation. Strangely, this is in circumstances where the government of Timor have acted in a manner consistent with the operation having taken place. Those words I read at the start come from Timor-Leste's memorial in The Hague. These are also circumstances in which the Australian government have themselves responded to these proceedings with a team full of lawyers and negotiators. They've prosecuted a former ASIS officer for conspiracy to reveal a bugging operation in an affidavit that was tendered to the Timor-Leste v Australia Permanent Court of Arbitration proceedings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that front, it's worth pointing out that on 2 April 2019 I asked the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department, Chris Moraitis, whether he was aware of the allegations in respect of Australia spying on the negotiating team of the East Timorese. He replied:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I'm aware of that. There's a criminal case in the ACT. I'm well aware of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, interestingly, he made the link between the spying and the case in the ACT, and that's not unexpected, because it turns out that he was in the Australian negotiating team that would have been a recipient of the product of the bugging activity. I went on to ask him if I would be correct in presuming most criminal cases were not launched on the basis of a fictitious operation. He responded: 'I would hope not.' So the dominant reason for the secrecy is to avoid having to publicly acknowledge the Australian government did the spying, when everyone knowsâ€”it's just plainâ€”that we did it, and that it would be appropriate to acknowledge it, for the healing of East Timor and indeed so that Australians can rightfully ask why it was that it was done. Indeed, I understand public interest rests, in most cases, in neither confirming nor denying intelligence operations, but in this case it swings the other way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we know about what's happening right now is that there are confidential briefs flying around inside the court, and I'm going to give you some hints as to what they go to. The Commonwealth's position will be to say: 'There was an operation.' Behind closed doors, they will say: 'There was an operation in East Timor,' and that Mr Collaery disclosed itâ€”that's what's going to be said. And Mr Collaery, by and large, will agree with that particular proposition, that there was a spying operation. They will, I understand, contest whether the operation was lawful and whether the operation was lawfully initiated. These are two different questions, but they go to our national interest and indeed our moral constitution. I have no doubt that it was neither legal nor initiated properly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question doesn't involve our national security sensitivities. It involves the sequence of events that led to the approval of the operation. As to the way in which these operations are approvedâ€”I'm not telling you anything that's classified; it's in the Intelligence Services Actâ€”there's a sequence; there's a proper process. Firstly, one of the ways in which to initiate one of these operations is for the executive, the collective, the national security cabinet, to basically state a government requirement. That government requirement must centre on some pretty crucial principles: it must be in our foreign relations interests, our national security interests or our economic interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A reasonable question one can ask is: 'How can an executive government, in a democracy ruled by law, ever make an activity that would breach a solemn, signed undertaking to act in good faith, breach international law, cheat a fiduciary commercial partner and breach Australian criminal laws a government requirement?' It's likely that there's going to be difficulty in relation to that particular requirement, because the Commonwealth has opposedâ€”and this is available in open courtâ€”the request or the subpoenas for cabinet documents. But there is a second pathway: a ministerâ€”particularly the foreign minister; in this case, Mr Downerâ€”can make a decision, provided he is satisfied and has consulted with other relevant ministers, and they may have been Mr Howard, the Prime Minister; Mr Ruddock, the Attorney-General; Mr Hill, the defence minister; and perhaps Mr Minchin, who was the minister for science and industry and also Minister Assisting the Prime Minister. All of those ministers should have been asked and there should be a written directive. I understand there isn'tâ€”and that doesn't surprise me, after my national cabinet case, because the court was scathing as to the record keeping of the Commonwealth government. So I suspect that all of those people I've just namedâ€”all those ministersâ€”will be on the subpoena list to give evidence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have specific controls placed on the intelligence services by this parliament, and my view is that they haven't been followed. My view is that this operation was instituted by Mr Downer, not properly authorised and done for the benefit of Woodside. We've seen in evidence before the parliamentary committees on treaties that the Commonwealth government has a view that Woodside's interests are the national interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we need to watch this case. I hope the court opens up the case, because the only thing that's really secret that will be talked about, and it's not secret, is the fact that the operation took place. Disclosure of the basic fact that the operation was conducted and who did or did not authorise that action would go towards healing the rift between East Timor and Australia and satisfying the Australian people. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:20</span>):  [by video link] A few short weeks ago my beautiful wife, Kristin Griff, passed away after a long and distressing battle with an aggressive form of breast cancer. She was not alone. A shocking number of Australians die from cancer each and every year; 50,000 died last year, and there were a further 150,000 who were diagnosed with cancer. These are unimaginable numbers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some Australians have a genetic predisposition to cancer, and this is often triggered by environmental factors of some kind. Others, like my wife, Kristin, have no apparent genetic predisposition. When they are diagnosed with cancer, it is usually because they were exposed to an environmental factor, or factors, of some kind. The best-known example is smoking, where an individual ingests a number of potent carcinogens which later develop into lung cancer. A great number of chemicals in our environment are carcinogenic or otherwise harmful. Many are known. Many are not. Just like malignant mesothelioma, it can be 30 to 40 years after exposure before it develops.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My wife, Kristin, was an active, nature-loving and health-conscious person. As an adult, she was careful about what she ingested and what she was exposed to. As a mother, she was just as careful about our family's health. But her childhood was very different. She grew up in a small seaside town and had a childhood that was generally happy and carefree. But now we can look back with fresh eyes and new knowledge and recognise the many risks this carefree childhood exposed her to. I will quote from some notes that she wrote to our daughter and her siblings to allay any fears they might have about them suffering the same fate as her via a genetic flaw: 'I was always wandering around at the depot with dad, the uncles and grandpa, or on the fuel truck for farm deliveries with dad. Bare feet, like most of my childhood prior to school age, from running around barefoot at the depot, except for yellow rubber boots in winter. I used to get in trouble all the time for leaving black smears all over the white enamel inside the bath. Leaded petrochemicals, kerosenes, sump oil, DDT and other farm crop chemical pesticides, many subsequently banned for use. Sheep dip and drenching chemicals. We swam in sheep dip, as many of us country kids did. Kids in the sheep run, to push sheep through. Ant and spider dust, surface powder, hessian sacks of improved seed for crop planting. Dad smoked indoors and in the car every day of my life until I went to Finland at age 16.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is staggering what people were exposed to in decades past, but only in hindsight. At the time, these exposures were commonplace. Parents were not believed to be negligent for exposing their children to second-hand smoke or to DDT, as they would be today. The harms were not known at the time. In many cases, it took decades of widespread use before it became clear that certain chemicals were carcinogenic. By then, it was too late for too many.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the postwar decades, we made great advances in chemical science. In every facet of life, new chemical products were developed and brought quickly to market. Everything from pesticides to toothpaste was improved, again and again. These products rapidly became better, cheaper and more widely used. But our understanding of chemical safety did not advance anywhere near as quickly, and we individuals and government failed to act with care. We assumed products were safe until they were shown to be unsafe. For example, DDT was released to the public in 1945. By the 1950s, it was widely used in Australia to wipe out mosquito populations and to protect crops from insects. But, by the mid-1960s, its harmful effects were becoming widely understood. It was toxic: a danger to human health and ecosystems. In 1972, it was banned in the United States, but it would take another 15 years before Australia followed suit. However, the harm didn't stop then. The toxic effects of DDT are long-lived. More than 30 years on, there are still accumulations in our natural environment which will persist for decades to come. This means there are many Australians living today who were exposed to DDT in their childhood, just like my wife, Kristin, who have toxic accumulations in their body and who are unaware it could ultimately cause the cancer that may take their lives.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenge we face today is not regulating and restricting the use of DDT. That battle has been fought and won. The battle today is ensuring that the other chemicals available in Australia safe for the people working with and around the chemicals, safe for the people or animals who may consume or be exposed to the chemicals and, most importantly, safe for our natural environment. We need to ensure that governments act with respect to the precautionary principleâ€”that is, assuming chemicals are harmful and prohibiting them until they are shown to be safe. It can't be enough for a company to assert that its products are harmless. Too often, we see companies using dishonest studies with secret commercial-in-confidence data to evade regulation. Why else would it have taken 15 years for Australia to follow the US in banning DDT? Were governments ignorant of the danger? Of course not! Lobbyists and corporate interests acted to protect their business.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every one of us in this chamber has had some experience where a rent-seeker has tried to slow down or kill off regulation. Most recently, we have seen it with big tobacco and vaping products, which they want legalised because they are less deadly than their other products. Such companies care nothing for the public and only care for their profits. This is why government must ensure that chemicals are independently evaluated in Australia and, most importantly, re-evaluated over time. We should never rely on a study, as we have with glyphosate, that was over 30 years old. We need to re-evaluate studies over time. The evaluation methods and data must also be made publicly available, so that academics and researchers can verify those results and give the public confidence that their governments are working properly to protect them. Acting today won't stop a single case of cancer this year or next year or the year after, but it could help to prevent thousands of cancer deaths in 2030 and beyond. We can look back at parents in the postwar decades and say they acted responsibly, given the knowledge available at the time. Decades from now, will our children be able to say the same about us?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past 18 months, Australia has had slightly less than 40,000 COVID cases and 1,000 deaths. We mobilised our entire health community, locked down cities and states, and closed our borders to protect our community from the threat of COVID. During the same time, we have had more than 220,000 new cancer diagnoses and 75,000 cancer deaths. We don't need COVID policies for cancer, but there are reasonable steps we can take today to protect the community. Radically better chemical regulation and testing is one of those important steps. We owe it to our constituents and to our children to make sure we act today and, this time, we get it right.</span>
