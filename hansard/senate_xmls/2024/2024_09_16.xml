We do, however, acknowledge the interest in the chamber in continuing to reform the NDIS to get it back on track and ensure its sustainability for future generations. I also acknowledge the support of the opposition in working together with the government to this end and voting in support of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Getting the NDIS Back on Track No. 1) Bill 2024, which passed the parliament on 22 August 2024. The NDIS bill received royal assent on 5 September 2024, which means the new laws will come into effect on 3 October 2024.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 8 February 2024, the government tabled the final report of the Independent Review into the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which was publicly released on 7 December 2023. In producing this report, the independent NDIS review panel travelled to every state and territory, including regional and remote communities. It heard directly from more than 10,000 Australians, worked with disability organisations to reach out and listen to more than 1,000 people with disability and their families, recorded more than 2,000 personal stories and received more than 4,000 submissions. The review delivered 26 recommendations and 139 supporting actions to respond to its terms of reference. In delivering its recommendations, the review provided exhaustive analysis and proposals to improve the operation, effectiveness and sustainability of the NDIS. The independent NDIS review panel has said its reforms can improve the scheme and meet National Cabinet's annual growth target of no more than eight per cent by 1 July 2026.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS bill was the first legislative step by this government to ensuring this annual growth target is achieved. Following the passage of the NDIS bill, discussions will continue with senators across this chamber, as well as members in the other place, to address questions about the government's NDIS reform agenda, which it is pursuing together with the disability community. We look forward to continuing to work with senators in this place to get the NDIS back on track and ensure its sustainability for future generations of Australians.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the order being discussed, the government have previously outlined that we have claimed public interest immunity over the requested documents as disclosure would prejudice relations between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. The Minister representing the Treasurer has already tabled key documents for the benefit of the Senate, in addition to the aforementioned review.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian community feel deeply disappointed, frustrated and downright angry with this Labor government. These feelings exist in our community not only because, in this cost-of-living crisis, the government has failed to respond to people's pain in the way that the community rightly expects but also because this Labor government has failed to keep its commitment to the Australian people to act with accountability and transparency. This failure to act with accountability and transparency is on display again today as, once again, this government uses its powers to attempt to keep secret information which disabled people as well as our families and organisations have the right to be able to see, engage with and know about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The information they continue to keep from the community relates to precisely what they have agreed with the states and territories in relation to how many participants will be thrown off the NDIS because of the cuts they have agreed to and the legislation they have rammed through. It has been almost a year since the Australian Senate began to request the government to provide this information. In making these requests, we have continually made it clear that, in using their powers to keep this information from the community, they are breaching their commitment to transparency and that, in order to rebuild the trust with the disability community created by that breach, they need to set out clearly and precisely, as is required of them by law, the grounds upon which they continue to withhold this information. And they've failed to do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see here is a tiny window into why people are so frustrated, disappointed and angry. Right here, the government have been given the opportunity to be honest and transparent, and they are instead choosing secrecy and the use of their powers to keep information from the community that the community have a right to know. These types of actions deeply undermine the trust of the community not only in this Labor government but in all governments—a trust which is already justifiably low. The Australian community do not trust people in positions of power in parliament because, decade after decade, decision after decision, people in positions of power have lied. People in positions of power have used the protections of parliament to mislead the Australian community as they have pursued their own personal political goals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons disabled people are particularly angry and particularly disappointed right now is that this Labor government explicitly committed to honesty, transparency and accountability. When they went to the election, Labor said that the Liberal government had been dishonest and untrustworthy and had sought to do the Australian disability community harm, and that a vote for them would mean an end to those practices. Labor delivered the precise opposite. They've cut the NDIS. They've continued the culture of secrecy and dishonesty and to this day refuse to provide disabled people with basic information on what Labor committed behind closed doors when they agreed to cap and cut the NDIS. This is shameful behaviour, and we cannot let it pass.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUGHES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:10</span>):  I'm actually really over this. It's been a year that this government has been required to provide these documents, and yet again we come in here with this mealy-mouthed statement claiming that, somehow or other, announcing or sharing the framework around sustainability is going to damage relationships with the states and the territories. We wake up to news this morning that Minister Shorten is now proposing a new tranche of reforms. This is not something that has been discussed with the opposition. As Senator Farrell just acknowledged, the opposition is working with the government for reform, and we do want to see reform. There are too many people on the scheme. The scheme is blowing out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we wake up this morning to news about registration. It's something that the opposition actually put forward as an amendment, saying there should be scalable registration within the scheme, which would ensure that sole providers—sole traders—are able to be registered but would not face onerous audit costs that would thin an already thin market. But we're now learning the minister is looking at not only complete registration of all providers; he's also targeting self-managed participants. I find this extraordinary, and perhaps, if he'd bothered to pick up the phone to me or to Mr Sukkar in the other place, who is the opposition NDIS shadow minister, I certainly could have told him that the CEO of the NDIA explained at estimates that the lowest level of fraud is actually within the self-managed sector. That is because people who self-manage plans, either for themselves or their loved ones, have direct contact with the service provider. Those service providers tend to provide better customised services because they're not part of mass, previously block funded organisations, who quite often deliver nothing but glorified babysitting services. Again, this government is looking at the wrong people to see where fraud and misconduct is occurring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the minister is also looking at the wedding-tax style of increasing costs for NDIS services, particularly for what we refer to in the scheme as 'consumables'. That's things like wheelchairs and walking sticks, or needing rails put up in your bathroom for access and support. We know that the reason these costs blow out is the regulation around how these are provided. Someone explain this to me, because basic economics tell you that, when you add more red tape, costs go up. The NDIA has listed registered providers who are the only people who can deliver these consumables, rather than someone who is managing a scheme, like the parent of a participant who requires support rails. I know of a story around this. For support rails in the bathroom, they were quoted in excess of $3,000 by one of the NDIA's registered, approved providers for these sorts of materials. As they were waiting—because there's a time to wait, because there are so many people requesting these kinds of services, and there are limited registered providers, so they can charge whatever they want—a father had had enough, went to Bunnings and put them up himself for $50.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the minister is now trying to do—from what we see in the paper, because it's not being discussed with us—is to increase the burden on participants to use these registered providers, of which there'll be a limited amount. Supply and demand tells you that if you can't access a service then the price is going to go up. This is now making the scheme worse. We want to work with the minister to cut costs, we want to make it sustainable, we want to make it accessible and we want to make it fit for purpose. Yet this minister is barking up every wrong tree and will not provide the information to let us work with him constructively.</span>

More than a year ago, a majority of this Senate passed a resolution that certain very crucial documents in relation to the NDIS should be produced to this Senate so that we would have the benefit, as senators representing the people of Australia, to review that documentation. The government refused to provide that information. The basis on which the Labor government refused to provide that information included that it would prejudice relationships between the Commonwealth government and the state governments. But the one point they can't answer—that they refuse to answer—is how. How is it going to prejudice relations between the Commonwealth government and state governments? Second, have they actually asked the state governments whether they have any objection to the Senate having access to that information?</span>

That is the shameful situation you're witnessing today, where a majority of the Senate has requested information for over a year, and the Labor government refuses to provide it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  As citizens of a democracy, it's reasonable to expect a high level of transparency around the decisions that govern our lives. It should go without saying that disabled people deserve no different. NDIS participants deserve to know the full details of the financial sustainability framework that all state premiers, chief ministers and the Prime Minister agreed to. This reeks of a captain's call designed to serve the narrative of politicians by using 4.4 million disabled people across this country as political footballs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's recap how we got here. In April, state premiers, chief ministers and the Prime Minister met and secretly agreed to the NDIS Financial Sustainability Framework, which would map out the financial future of the NDIS. They are refusing to release this document. In May the Senate formally requested that the Albanese government table the framework. The government's response was that the document didn't exist. To put it in more meaningful terms, the government admitted to having no long-term financial basis for their May decision to impose budget cuts on the NDIS. For all we know, they plucked the eight per cent figure out of the sky. In June the Senate again ordered the government to table the framework. It is, after all, supposedly the document upon which the government's plan to slash billions from the NDIS originated. This time we were informed that the National Cabinet made a commitment to establish this framework but that it would remain under wraps.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Folks, one of these things is not like the other. How can the same demand one month apart yield such different responses? A few days later, the Senate again ordered the Minister representing the Treasurer to produce the framework. Still the government refused to comply. And just last week it was revealed that a freedom-of-information request for the framework by an Australian media outlet was rejected. It was rejected by the Treasury, rejected by the Department of Social Services and rejected by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the NDIS is to serve the interests of disabled people who need and want to access it. It is not to protect the interests of government. Major party politics pales in comparison to the right of every disabled person and their family to understand the decisions that affect them. They deserve to know how the Labor government came to its decision to cut around $59 billion from the NDIS over a decade. Recently, Labor and the Liberals teamed up to push the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Getting the NDIS Back on Track No. 1) Bill through this parliament. We are seeing those harms materialise now, with participants' plans being cut and their supports defunded. My inbox is bulging with concerned constituents. They're stressed and feeling anxious about what these cuts mean to their plans and their ability to live a decent life. The changes set out in the NDIS bill are intended to cut $14.4 billion from the NDIS, which can only be achieved by removing supports for participants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The financial sustainability document and the NDIS bill are two examples of Labor putting their bottom line before the welfare of disabled people. I urge the Labor government to listen to the constituents who are reaching out and expressing their deep sorrow, anxiety, stress and uncertainty about what the future holds for them and about what is potentially coming down the pipeline. If these sorts of cuts can be made without genuine, meaningful input from the disabled community, then what's to stop further erosion of this critical piece of social policy in the future? I implore the government to honour its commitment to building trust with the disability community and to release the NDIS Financial Sustainability Framework so we can have the full picture of what their intentions are for this scheme.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:22</span>):  It's been two years since the Prime Minister announced Labor's policy—the only demand-side housing policy that has been announced by the Prime Minister, I might say—the Help to Buy scheme. In May 2022, the Prime Minister promised that his shared-equity scheme would be up and running by 1 January 2023, and yet here we are today, in September 2024, and we haven't even seen a vote on this legislation. It's clear now that either it is ridiculously late or, potentially, this policy may never see the light of day. People around Australia have every right to be asking, 'What on earth have the housing ministers been doing all this time?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To have had this scheme operating by 1 January 2023, when the Prime Minister promised Australians it would be, the bill should have been introduced into the parliament in 2022. Instead, nearly two years later, the government has introduced a poorly designed, poorly targeted bill—the bill we are talking about today. The implementation of Help to Buy is now merely a tick-a-box exercise for Labor to fulfil their stale election commitment. The scheme is utterly underwhelming. It will be eligible to a mere 10,000 households per year and will cost the Commonwealth $5.5 billion, while the government retains a stake of up to 40 per cent in the homes that are purchased. This scheme is tiny compared with the 240,000 new homes required every year to fulfil the government's targeted commitment of 1.2 million homes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The state of homeownership in this country right now is very bleak. The new National Housing Accord kicked off on 1 July 2024 with a target of 240,000 homes each year. However, in the last 12 months we have seen less than 163,000 new home building approvals across Australia. One new home needs to be built every 2.4 minutes to keep up with Labor's promise to build 1.2 million homes. The HIA is forecasting 41,910 commencements in the 2024 September quarter. These numbers are business as usual under Labor. This is unsurprising, given the state of the construction industry, left in tatters by Labor's union mates at the CFMEU.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor, housing affordability in Australia has declined to its lowest levels since reporting of records began in 1996. According to CoreLogic, a mortgage holder earning a median income will now use just under 60 per cent of their income to service a loan on a medium-value dwelling in Sydney. The only policies supporting first home buyers are the ones Labor inherited from the former coalition government.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when fewer homes are being built and being approved, it's tougher to find a rental. There are record levels of migration. There were more than 520,000 migrants last year alone. This is an absolute world record in migration numbers. In the Senate economics committee inquiry into this bill, the Grattan Institute submitted:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Within living memory, all Australians had a reasonable chance to own a home. But now, for many Australians the Great Australian Dream of home ownership is becoming a nightmare.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are facing an unacceptable situation where homeownership is out of reach and we have absolutely nothing from the government that meaningfully supports first homeowners. What Australians need is a comprehensive policy agenda to address supply- and demand-side hurdles that is carefully calibrated alongside state and local government and is totally focused on individual homeownership. Instead, what do we get? This pitiful opportunity to co-own a home with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rest of Labor's agenda on housing includes: a target of 1.2 million new homes, which even Labor's own New South Wales Premier, Chris Minns, said won't be achieved; the Housing Australia Future Fund, a thinly veiled excuse to give institutional investors and super funds a leg-up to invest in the housing market by purchasing homes for Australians to rent; and a national housing supply affordability council that has only met once since this parliament. Labor  is making the housing crisis so much worse by not building enough homes, by allowing our population to grow faster than properties are being constructed and by advancing a policy approach that prioritises corporate homeownership over individual homeownership.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor, you can either own your own home with the Prime Minister and Clare O'Neill or rent from the industry super funds. This is not the Australian dream. Let's be clear: there are already shared equity products offered by state governments throughout the country. If somebody in South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria or Western Australia wants to co-own a home with the government, there are already plenty of opportunities for them to do so. In the South Australian scheme, for example, there are more places than people wanting to take them up. With all this in mind, what did Labor think to do? They thought, 'Let's bring in our own shared equity scheme,' even though there is one operating in most states in this country and even though there are available places under existing ones throughout the country. Given there are opportunities across the country to engage with shared equity schemes, it is unclear what gap this bill is seeking to address.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">UNSW gave evidence to the committee that the overlap between the proposed bill and the state schemes risked adding confusing complexity for potential service providers. Help to Buy gives the government a talking point so it can be seen to be addressing the housing crisis in the country without actually doing anything. The government should be removing barriers to homeownership for young Australians, not inserting themselves into the process. Economist and housing expert Peter Tulip told the committee that the scheme was a distraction from the broader supply challenges.  Economics professor John Quiggin agreed that the scheme was a very small solution to a big problem and something which has been designed on the basis of budgetary cosmetics rather than on saying, 'What is the scale of the problem and what do we need to do?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think that if you were 18 months late in bringing forward legislation like this you would be looking at something that was in perfect condition and perfect order, but what have we got here? The committee inquiry revealed that no public consultation was undertaken in the drafting of this legislation. That has clearly materialised in poor targeting, bad design and poor value for taxpayers' money. Major questions remain unanswered: What is the scheme's eligibility criteria? Who is eligible to apply? What happens if you make improvements to your home? What happens if you have a $5,000 repair to the roof? Who picks up the tab for that? Well, there are no answers in this bill either. Let's assume that everything goes really well, you end up buying a home with the government, you own 60 per cent and the government owns 40 per cent. Then you receive wonderful news in your life: you are expecting a child—or you may be expecting your second or third. You need to upgrade. You need to move home. The government will then say, 'Thank you very much; we'll take our money back.' Good luck upgrading, because you've just had 40 per cent ripped out of the proceeds of your home. So you could be forced to sell, you could have the money taken off you and your opportunity to move into your next home will be next to nothing. You can understand why this is not wanted by Australians at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The additional borrowing of the Commonwealth to fund this program is $5.5 billion. We say there are infinitely better ways of spending $5.5 billion than making people enter into these very dubious arrangements that many Australians clearly don't want. Further questions that aren't answered in these bills—bills that are, as I said, 18 months late—include: Will the ATO be auditing people's incomes? If you've got an income threshold, will the ATO be auditing you each year to determine whether you're going to have the rug pulled from under you and sell your house? What are the reporting obligations? What happens if you fall behind in your mortgage repayments? Many people and families are struggling under those increasing mortgage payments, so what happens if you fall behind in your payments? Is that when the government comes along, rips the rug from underneath you and says, 'Thank you very much; it's time for you to sell and we'll take our 40 per cent back'? You'd think the answers to these questions would all be contained in these bills. You'd think the Minister for Housing would have done some work in the last 18 months and given people some answers. But we don't have these answers in these bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To make matters worse, the scheme's price and income caps would make it redundant on day one. The price caps set by Labor fall below the median house values in every capital in Australia with the exception of Melbourne. In Sydney, the price cap of $950,000 looks like a sick joke when considering the median house price in Sydney in April this year was $1.421 million. That's not all; the income caps for eligible participants are totally unviable. The required income to service a mortgage to cover the difference between the government stake and the overall value sits above the income caps. In practice, this means a first home buyer could never conceivably purchase a home at the government's price cap. These caps led PropTrack to estimate that Sydneysiders would be unable to purchase 96 per cent of the houses on the market using the Help to Buy scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No answers, no idea. The government want us to come in here and support the bills and this scheme—a blank cheque for $5.5 billion—so they can force people to sell their homes. What lenders are participating in the scheme? We've got no idea there either. Who are the lenders? Are there going to be restrictions on who can borrow in conjunction with owning a home with the government? None of these questions are answered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bigger concern here is this: this is a government waving the white flag on homeownership in this country. In 20 months of Labor government we've seen nothing on first home buyers. They should see the light on the policy we took to the last election to enable first home buyers to access their superannuation to help them fund a deposit for their first home. Our policy, which we took to the last election, said, 'If you're a first home buyer, you can withdraw up to $50,000 of your own super and use that to contribute to a deposit to own your own house, and then when you sell the first home you're required to recontribute back into your super.' So your money is working for you at a time you need it most, and then when you sell your home and move to your next one you recontribute to your super so your retirement income is protected. It means you and your money are working for you. The Labor Party could never support that because the industry super funds tell Labor what to do. I say to senators opposite: you're just a vessel for the unions, and you might agree with them on a lot of things but surely there are times when they tell you to do something you don't agree with and you don't walk off the cliff with them. That's clearly what those opposite have done with this policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that allowing first home buyers to utilise their own super to help buy their own home and then requiring them to recontribute to it is a good policy. But this is all in the broader context in which these bills fail. We have a legacy of coalition policies that are helping first home buyers, but in almost 2.5 years we have seen absolutely nothing from this government. The entire housing market is crumbling around the new housing minister. Approvals are down, new home builds are down, first home buyers are at some of their lowest levels, rents are skyrocketing and, as for vacancy rates, trying to find a rental is extraordinarily tough. Our ability to build homes is being weakened by the day because we have insolvency after insolvency in the sector. And what do we get from this government? We get a pitiful shell of a bill with no answers to the questions in front of us. It is simply not good enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My final point highlights the chaotic dysfunctional nature of the housing agenda of this government. The Prime Minister went to the election promising that this scheme would open the door to homeownership for tens of thousands of Australians from 1 July 2023. But what the government didn't tell Australians was that it had no constitutional power to implement the scheme. Treasury confirmed at a committee public hearing that the scheme would operate only in states that passed legislation to refer powers to the Commonwealth and, in doing so, consent to the scheme. Treasury has provided no schedule or update on when the states will pass the required legislation. The bill, even if it does pass this parliament, is not effective until the state parliaments pass that legislation themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can't just bring in a bill 18 months late with no answers, no clarity and no certainty for Australians. For all those reasons, I reiterate that, as we said before the election, we do not support this bill. It shouldn't be called the Help to Buy Bill; it should be called the 'Force to Sell Bill', because that's what it will end up doing to Australians. We cannot in good consciousness support this bill. The scheme is a waste of taxpayers' money, and the $5.5 billion would be better employed by the Commonwealth in driving housing supply and supporting first home buyers with more effective policies. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians do not want to own a home with Anthony Albanese or Clare O'Neil. That is not the Australian dream. The Labor Party has given up on the Australian dream of homeownership, and Australians are paying the price.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  I rise to speak on the Help to Buy (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2023. Every time I rise in this place to speak about the housing and rental crisis, things have inevitably become much worse. Things have become much worse because this Labor government has failed to take the steps needed to make real change. Since the introduction of this legislation, the Greens have been clear that we are willing to negotiate with the government so we can actually help renters and first home buyers. Our door has been open, but Labor has not responded. It has not responded at all to the asks we have put on the table—the asks that will help tackle the housing crisis for millions of struggling people and families across this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has not budged at all. There has been nothing on rent caps, no proposal on negative gearing or the capital gains tax discount, no money for a public developer—nothing. Labor's housing minister might have changed, but nothing in their policy or their position has changed in being able to tackle the housing crisis. Now, here we are, with Labor throwing a tantrum and stubbornly trying to ram through this bill, which will drive up house prices, while still refusing to scrap the massive tax handouts to wealthy property investors that are denying millions of renters the chance to buy a home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People across the country are crying out for help as they battle with the increasing cost-of-living crisis and soaring rents and house prices. Millions of renters are struggling to keep their heads just above water, and the best Labor is willing to do is establish a housing lottery through which 0.2 per cent of renters might get access to this scheme every year. But it will drive up prices for the other 99.8 per cent of renters. The evidence to the Senate inquiry into this bill was pretty clear that the scheme will benefit a tiny minority and will have the ultimate effect of driving up house prices. In the context of already soaring house prices, mortgages and rents, to say that this is not good enough would be an understatement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Help to Buy scheme offers up to 10,000 people—10,000 people only—the chance to have the government purchase 30 to 40 per cent of a private home. People will be eligible only if they earn below $120,000 for a couple and below $90,000 for an individual and only if the house price is below a certain amount, depending on the city or the region. In Sydney, the house price limit in this bill is $950,000. The median house price in Sydney is over $1.6 million. There are 5.5 million adult renters in Australia and, even at capacity—and we know that schemes like this are nowhere near their capacity in New South Wales, for instance—a maximum of 10,000 renters out of 5.5 million will be able to use this scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just the Greens that are concerned about this bill. During the Senate inquiry, Mr Matt Grudnoff, senior economist at the Australia Institute, said this:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Help to Buy scheme, like many previous housing affordability schemes from both major parties, is a policy to boost the financial position of a particular group , usually first home buyers. The problem with these kinds of policies is that they simply increase demand for housing, and this increases the price of housing. The result is that it makes housing less affordable.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">These schemes have been around forever,<span style="background-color:#FFFFFF;&#xA;    font-family:Verdana;&#xA;  &#xA;    color:#444444;&#xA;  &#xA;    font-size:10pt;&#xA;  "></span>but the money is eventually capitalised into house prices, so the beneficiaries gain at the expense of everyone else.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Scrapping negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts are not just 'nice to haves' or levers that we could pull; it is absolutely critical if we want to make housing affordable in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For over two years now, we have heard Labor say, 'Give us time; give us time,' and we're nearing the end of a full term of government, and people are really frustrated, angry and sick and tired of Labor's hollow words and false promises as they suffer and struggle every single day. Housing is a human right. In a wealthy country, it is inconceivable that so many people are experiencing homelessness and housing stress. They are one rent payment away from losing their home. They are struggling to keep a roof over their head. All this is happening while corporations are making billions of dollars in profit. The government has a duty to provide accessible, affordable, good quality housing for everyone.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of those experiencing homelessness, 20 per cent are First Nations people, despite First Nations people making up only 3.8 per cent of the population. It should be a source of national shame that so many First Nations people are experiencing homelessness on their own land. As usual, it is those at the intersections of marginalisation and discrimination who are hit the hardest. We have a housing system that screws over millions of people while banks and property developers make an absolute killing off the misery of ordinary people. The Greens are fighting for a two-year freeze on rent increases. We are fighting for the phasing-out of unfair tax concessions, like negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. And we want to invest that money into building high-quality, government built, accessible, affordable homes, sold and rented at prices people can actually afford.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is desperately needed, because here is the situation. Rents have skyrocketed 53 per cent since 2020. Housing prices have increased 46 per cent since 2020. The shortage of public and social housing is projected to increase under this government from an already unacceptable high of 750,000 homes. Over the next 10 years, the federal government will give $176 billion in tax handouts to property investors, through negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. By comparison, this Labor government has committed to zero dollars of ongoing direct spending on public housing and just $500 million a year for social housing through the Housing Australia Future Fund. That is the dire situation. I will be moving a second reading amendment to that effect later on.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics data, rents—like I said before—have increased at nearly double the rate of wages over the last year alone, putting millions of renters under significant and massive financial stress and making it impossible for many to ever save enough to buy a home in the first place. You can talk to any young person these days, and they will tell you they have completely given up their dream of owning their first home. Despite increased national wealth in GDP, homeownership rates across Australia are falling. In particular, they are falling faster amongst younger and poorer people. The housing crisis is the result of the direct failure of public policy choices. These choices have been made by successive Liberal and Labor governments. People's lives are being destroyed because of insecure housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government are aware of the effects that experiencing the housing and rental crisis has on every possible measure of an individual's participation in our community, and yet they have put a scheme before parliament that equates to no more than tinkering around the edges, and I'm being generous here when I say 'tinkering around the edges'. The government has the opportunity, has had the opportunity and still has the opportunity to work with the Greens right now to start to address these systemic issues that are forcing more and more people into housing stress and homelessness. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schemes like Help to Buy allow people to pay more for housing than they otherwise would be able to afford. As a result of these demand-side support measures—and there are other examples of these types of schemes, including the first home buyers grant and the coalition's HomeBuilder program—overall homeownership rates are lowered, as more people are priced out of housing. So, while the Help to Buy scheme might help the 0.2 per cent of people lucky to get access to the scheme, for the other 99.8 per cent it will make things worse by driving up house prices even further. Even though this is a small scheme, anything that pushes house prices up in the middle of a housing affordability crisis is a step in the wrong direction, and this is a decision that the Greens are not prepared to take.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I'm out doorknocking on weekends, the stress that people are feeling, the betrayal that people are feeling, is palpable. They know that Labor's 'no-one left behind' mantra before the election was just an empty slogan. They know that the bad choices that Labor is making are leaving more and more people behind. And, disgracefully, Labor has now joined the Liberals in using migrants and international students as scapegoats, blaming them for their own policy failures in not addressing the housing and rental crisis. There is not much lower to sink here, and it is despicable dog whistling. Migrants and international students are feeling really attacked at this point in time, and that is a shame, and both Labor and the Liberals should be ashamed of continuing this rhetoric and this dog whistling—more and more—to win some kind of political game that they are playing, using these people as pawns in that game.</span>

It is the people struggling to put food on the table. It is the people struggling to pay for the dentist. It is the people struggling under an ever-increasing HECS debt. It is the people struggling to pay the rent. These will be the losers, and there are millions and millions of them in this country.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="259819" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:49</span>):  I'm really pleased to stand here today and speak about the Help to Buy Bill 2023 and the associated legislation that the Albanese Labor government is bringing forward to the parliament. We have a very firm view that it is the role of our government to help Australians with housing, particularly Australians who deserve to have their own home but who, without this bill, will not have an opportunity to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I suspect that, throughout this debate and in many contributions from across the Senate chamber, we will hear about the Labor government and about politics, and we will hear many contributions from the Greens political party and the Liberal and National parties that seek to frame our government as not doing enough to help people when it comes to housing. I choose to speak about this bill and the people that it will help because, at the end of the day, this is about people. While the Greens political party, the Liberal and National parties and others in this chamber choose to use this bill to play politics with people's lives, I will talk about the people that this bill will help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this bill will assist 40,000 Australians to buy a new or existing home with a smaller deposit because they'll be backed by the government. These are Australians who want to own their home and parents who want their kids to be able to enter the housing market. We know how difficult it is to do that right now, but the Liberals and Nationals are blocking this bill here in the Senate, which is no surprise. We hear a lot of 'no' from Mr Dutton and his colleagues. But, as has been canvassed already in this debate, the Greens are also choosing to block this bill, even though it's a shared equity model, which is something they had previously supported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's important in this debate to remember what our government has done, and is doing, to support Australians when it comes to housing. We are backing a boost to rent assistance. We've expanded the Home Guarantee Scheme. We're working with National Cabinet to get a better deal on rent, and we want to add Help to Buy to this list. That's what debating this legislation this week means. We're also building a better future with a suite of policies, including our Homes for Australia Plan to build 1.2 million well-located homes over five years and the Housing Australia Future Fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals and Nationals want Australians to raid their retirement savings to buy property, and no Australian should have to mortgage their future to achieve homeownership today. The Greens are not serious about helping people into homes; they're only serious about using this crisis to win more votes. It is concerning to hear opposition to a bill like this from a political party that has called for action on housing for the last 2½ years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens political party are choosing to do three things in this debate. First, they're seeking to minimise the incredible and important impact that this bill will have on Australians who otherwise would not be able to afford their own home. We're talking about low-paid workers, including nurses, teachers and childcare workers. These are the people that this bill seeks to assist. But the Greens have framed them as a group of people who are not worthy of support, and that is a shame. Secondly, they're seeking to be misleading about what this bill does, so I'll step through, in my contribution, what this bill is all about and how it seeks to help people. They're doing this to justify their opposition to it. They're saying, 'The bill will do this and that and the sky will fall.' Those two things can't be true. You can't say that this bill is so small and minuscule that it will not help anyone but also that the bill would have such ramifications that the sky would fall in on housing prices. It is a ridiculous proposition, and it really shows that for them this is a debate about politics whereas, for the Labor government, it's about helping people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last thing that we will see from the Greens political party and others in this chamber is to make this bill and the debate about this bill about a range of other policies and other issues to claim that somehow blocking this bill will help achieve something and will eventually help build more houses. It won't, and we know that blocking this bill will block houses. That's all it will achieve: houses won't be built if this bill is blocked. The Help to Buy Bill will establish a national shared equity program that will assist low- and middle-income earners to buy new or existing homes. These are the people I'm speaking about today when I talk about who will be assisted: low-paid workers, teachers, nurses and childcare educators. The program will allow them to access an equity contribution from the Commonwealth of up to 30 to 40 per cent of the purchase price, and it'll make a home purchase feasible for up to 40,000 households. I've said this before and I'll say it again: this legislation will be life-changing for those households, for young people who could never feel that homeownership is in reach, for lower-income families who could use the scheme to upsize their family home and look after their growing family, or even for older Australians who have enough savings for a housing deposit and would no longer have to stress about paying off a mortgage before they retire.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Help to Buy Scheme is an essential piece of the puzzle for improving our housing crisis. The legislation will also have to be passed at a state level, and I'm proud to see that my home state of Queensland is leading the way in this reform. The Queensland state government has enacted their own Help to Buy legislation so that Queenslanders can access the scheme as soon as possible. Like the Albanese Labor government, the Queensland state government is committed to helping more Queenslanders to afford their own home. Whether through Help to Buy, by doubling the first home owners grant or by increasing loan support for regional Queenslanders, they're doing what they can to make homeownership a reality for thousands more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be emphasised that this Help to Buy Bill is just one commitment from our government when it comes to homeownership, renting and housing security within this country. Our government is supporting tens of thousands of new and affordable houses through our $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund—houses and homes for Australians that would have been built sooner if not for the delays we saw from the Greens. Our government is also helping nearly one million Australian households with the cost of rent by delivering $1.9 billion over five years to increase Commonwealth Rent Assistance by 10 per cent. And our government has agreed to a $9.3 billion five-year National Agreement on Social Housing and Homelessness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike those opposite, who have been more than happy to vote down housing legislation and did not offer a new dollar for a new home, we are taking action. We're working with the housing and construction sector and with other tiers of government to ensure that homes are built on the ground more quickly. And we're going to ensure that owning a house is a reality for more Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I feel particularly strongly about this sentiment for my own community of Cairns in regional Queensland. The Australian government's Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee shows what is possible when the government supports new home owners. It's a perfect example of how these housing schemes are wanted by Australians and their changing lives. The Home Guarantee Scheme report found that 37 per cent of all first home buyer guarantees in 2022-23 were for first home buyers in regional areas. Queensland also has the highest concentration, out of all the states and territories, of regional first home guarantees, with 35 per cent issued to Queenslanders. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that we recognise in this parliament that these schemes are important for all Australians but especially in regional Australia, especially for lower- and middle-income earners, and especially for young people who lack hope that owning a home could be a possibility in the future. We on this side of the chamber know that a national shared equity scheme would help level the playing field for these Australians. And we know that it's not a new scheme within our country. We've seen examples of this before, such as in Victoria, where a shared equity scheme has helped more than 7,000 Victorians to buy a home. New South Wales ran a two-year trial of a shared equity scheme as well. And we know that this bill will change the possibility of homeownership for thousands of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But unfortunately throughout this debate we will see an attempt to hold this legislation up and to prevent this bill from going through. Unfortunately, it's not about any of the homes that this bill could buy. It is about politics. It's about the Greens having an opportunity to send out more campaign emails, attend more rallies, talk more about the things that aren't being done, instead of just getting down and doing them. Only the Greens political party would rather help no-one than help tens of thousands of Australians. Only the Greens would rather delay and block life-changing legislation for over a year and argue that, somehow, they're actually helping people. We just know this isn't true. We've seen members of the Greens political party attend rallies and rant and shout about all the things that could be done. Here's an opportunity to get something done in the Senate this week. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the start of this speech, I spoke about the people this will impact, and I want to share a small story because this is real life. We're talking about low- and middle-income earners here. We're talking about teachers, childcare educators and, yes, nurses. My mum is a nurse, and we never owned our own home. We never had the opportunity to draw on the side of a wall the height that we were growing to as the years went on. If we ever did, we'd have to paint over it. We never owned our own home. Mum's a nurse and a single mum. At one stage, we had to leave the home because of family and domestic violence. My family, the one that I grew up in, is exactly the type of family and the type of people that this bill would help. These are exactly the types of people who would be helped into homeownership by this bill. These are exactly the types of people that the Greens political party say shouldn't and can't be helped by this bill. These are exactly the types of people that those opposite are turning their backs on. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a real crime in this country that we cannot get this chamber to agree that a small group of people—nurses, teachers, childcare educators—deserve to have a home of their own and that their kids deserve to grow up in a home where they can draw their height as they grow from eight years old to 10 years old to 12 years old and never have to paint over it. That's what this bill is about. It's about people and families and homes to build memories in. But unfortunately today we're going to hear debate after debate about politics, particularly from the Greens political party, who absolutely should know better. There are times for campaigning, rallying, doorknocking and talking about the things that you wish you could do, but sometimes, in this chamber, there are times to just get things done. At the moment, we are in a situation where you have the Albanese Labor government who wants to build more homes in this country and you have the Greens political party prepared to block them. We are building more homes; they are prepared to block them. That's what people will remember from this week and this debate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, we have a government willing to take up the fight when it comes to housing affordability. We've got proposals on the table and an ambitious plan to build more houses all across Australia. I've stepped foot in the houses that our regional homebuyers grants have built. I look forward to seeing more houses built in regional Australia. We are getting on with the job of building houses for Australians. It's something that we committed to when we came to government. I really hope that the Senate looks at this bill, takes the opportunity to work together, instead of working against Australians and blocking housing, and gives this government the opportunity to build more houses and to help more people into houses of their own for their families, for their kids and for the memories that they'll build together over many years to come.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="256063" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:04</span>):  If the Labor Party want any advice on why the Australian people are losing confidence in their political party, they need to look no further than housing. It was 870 days ago that the Prime Minister announced the Help to Buy scheme at the Labor Party's campaign launch. And here we are, at the back end of this parliamentary term, with the government now seeking to legislate Help to Buy after having presided over a massive failure on housing. We are seeing fewer houses built, and we are seeing fewer Australians getting into the market for the first time. The number of first home buyers in Australia is down over the last few years of the Labor Party being in office, and that is a huge regret for our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of affordability—that is, the nexus between how much money you earn and how much you pay for your mortgage—we are looking at 60 per cent of people being under very serious mortgage stress in Australia. Since the election in May 2022, there has been a massive influx of people into Australia. We have always welcomed migrants in this country, but there's always been an agreement, generally speaking, that the people you bring into the country need to be housed. What we've seen is over a million people coming into the country but only a couple of hundred thousand houses being built. If you go back just eight years, we were building 230,000 houses in this country. Now, under this government, we're only building 160,000 houses, so we are going backwards. You don't need to be Einstein to work this out: if you build fewer houses, you make the problem worse. This is a massive supply problem. We need to be building over 250,000 houses a year to arrest this major problem, and what we're seeing is Labor building only 160,000 houses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has had two major supply policies. The Housing Australia Future Fund, which is a massive boondoggle fund, spends millions of dollars on administration and paying the CEO a big salary, but it builds no houses. Housing Australia now has former Labor members of parliament on its board. It has the back door open to the CFMEU. The CFMEU's favourite super funds—First Super, Cbus, and the other one—can go in and access taxpayer funds through the Housing Australia Future Fund. That is also partly linked to the housing targets. So the government say they've got a housing target. They want to build 1.2 million houses over the next five years, but their own adviser, the Housing Affordability and Supply Council, says that will never happen. All the independent economists say the government has no chance of ever meeting its supply target of 1.2 million houses. You've seen the government put in place a boondoggle fund that builds no houses, and they have housing targets that they will never, ever, ever meet. It's a huge failure on supply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we get to demand. How will the government help first home buyers on the demand side? How will the government tilt the scales in favour of first home buyers? They have one answer: Help to Buy. Announced 870 days ago, it's a puny scheme that will help 10,000 people. When we need to be building 250,000 houses, they have a solution for 10,000 people. That's it. The cupboard is bare. They have one idea: Help to Buy, announced 870 days ago. So what on earth has this government been doing over the past 2½ years? Not very much. They seem to be very boxed in with their ideological problems. The Help to Buy scheme is culturally jarring in this country because the Australian people don't want to co-own their house with the government. The Australian dream is about people owning houses; it is not about the government co-owning their house. I'm not sure that Mr Albanese is such a good landlord anyway; we read in the papers that he hasn't been so good to his tenants. So the Australian people do not want to co-own their house with Mr Albanese. Peter Tulip, the economist from the CIS, said this is a distraction. John Piggott, another economist, said it's not to scale.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This scheme with 10,000 places is a pimple on the elephant's backside when you consider the scale of the problem here. We need to be building 240,000 houses a year. This scheme would cost $5.5 billion, and one of the most serious problems with the design features we found in the Economics Legislation Committee inquiry was that the caps are far too low. The median house price in Sydney is $1.4 million, and the Help to Buy cap is $900,000; in Brisbane, the median house price is $920,000, and the Help to Buy cap is $700,000; and here in Canberra the median house price is $970,000, and the Help to Buy cap is $750,000. So this is a hopeless scheme. The scheme caps are way too low for the median house price, so I'm not sure who it's designed for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the most troubling part of it is that this is their only idea. They have no other ideas on demand. They have no other ideas on how to help first home buyers. They're too afraid to look at superannuation, which is the biggest pool of capital the average worker has today. Unless you are lucky enough to have access to the bank of mum and dad—which is now the sixth-biggest lender in Australia—super is likely to be your only hope if you are an average worker. But Labor say, 'No, we can't let you use your own money.' In fact, they say you'll be raiding your own money if you use your own money to get into the first-home market. The key fact, though, is that the key determinant for success in retirement is not your superannuation balance; it is your homeownership status. Labor is closing the door on the most practical, useable solution for first home buyers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing you never hear from Labor is anything about lending, mortgages and banking policy. One thing the Commonwealth government has in its preserve is banking policy, under the corporations power. They never talk about how hard it is to get a mortgage and how high the regulatory burden is on people trying to get that elusive first mortgage; they never talk about that. They only have one idea: Help to Buy, a discredited scheme, run by almost all the states and territories—and it's always undersubscribed; no-one wants to use this scheme. In fact, the Victorians are closing theirs down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to give you another insight into the maladministration here in Canberra, only one state, Queensland, has referred its powers under the Constitution, which is necessary to give effect to this scheme. We just heard Senator Green talk about that. Only one state has made the necessary referral. So the idea that these are urgent bills, after 870 days, is an absolute joke. The new housing minister has the same problem as the old housing minister: the policies are completely cooked. No wonder young people are going crazy about housing, because housing in Australia is getting so much worse under this government. There are fewer first home buyers, there are fewer houses being built and the government has one callous scheme—Help to Buy, which it knows won't touch the sides in every major capital city except for Melbourne.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea that we've got to rush in here today, debate these bills and pass these bills in the next few days is a cruel hoax. Help to Buy will help very few Australians. This is a massive problem requiring a serious solution from a serious government. Australia does not have that at the moment, and that's why it's urgent that we get on and have the election so we can get rid of this terrible government and get the Australian dream back on track.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="256136" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVID POCOCK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:12</span>):  It's deeply concerning to see housing affordability being politicised the way the climate debate has been. We know that all that happened was a delay to the actions we so desperately needed. I'm really concerned that we're now seeing the same thing here on housing. I agree that we need to see much more ambition from government—so much more ambition—starting with doubling the size of the Housing Australia Future Fund, from which we saw the first round of announcements of projects today. There is capacity in the sector to build more social and affordable housing faster, and the federal government can and should support them to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to start to address some of the root causes of the housing affordability crisis, which means that we must have a conversation about tax reform. We can't have a situation where young people can't afford housing while at the same time taxpayers are subsidising people in foregone tax concessions for their fourth, fifth or sixth investment property to the tune of $20 billion a year within the decade. We need to raise that revenue and direct it to more public and social housing. Only one per cent of Australian taxpayers own nearly a quarter of all property investments across the country. How can we talk about the egalitarian dream of Australia and allow that to happen, where one per cent of taxpayers own 25 per cent of the property and we have a whole generation of Australians locked out of homeownership?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our housing crisis is feeding growing intergenerational inequality, and we have to turn that around. I hear so much from Canberrans who don't like what's happening. They see the intergenerational inequality, and they want politicians, decision-makers, to start turning the ship around. But that obviously means compromising, being constructive and actually making some changes. We know there are no silver bullets. That's magical thinking—to think that when it comes to housing there's a silver bullet that will change it all. We are in a very, very deep hole when it comes to this housing crisis, and it's going to take a lot to get us out of it. But I'm worried that politics is standing in the way of delivering measures that, while not perfect and certainly not the whole solution, can and will help. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I back the intent of this bill because it will help people who don't have wealthy parents get into housing. We live in a country now where the bank of mum and dad is one of the biggest lenders, and, if you don't have wealthy parents, you're basically stuffed. We can't allow that to happen. We need to start putting measures in place now and also dealing with some of the root causes of the crisis that we're in. This bill will help older women—the cohort most at risk of homelessness—purchase a home on their own, and the same for single parents. While technically a demand-side measure when what we need is more supply, this bill will help some of the most vulnerable people in our community get into homeownership. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Economists and experts are united in saying the impact of the bill on house prices will be negligible. That was pretty clear at the hearing. But the bill can be better, and I'll be moving a number of amendments, co-sponsored by crossbench colleagues, to do that. Firstly, I want to see the scheme expanded to 30,000 places per annum, with at least one-third of these places going to older women or First Nations people. Homeownership rates amongst First Nations people are below the national average. We know housing is an enabler of other social benefits. Access to safe, secure and affordable housing helps deliver better health, educational and economic outcomes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This scheme should also extend beyond the forward estimates. Four years is not long enough to fix the housing crisis. If the government believes in this scheme, this scheme should operate for longer. I also want to see the object of the bill amended to sharpen the focus of what this bill seeks to do, by explicitly acknowledging the need to focus on housing outcomes for historically disadvantaged Australians, again including older women and First Nations people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll also be moving an amendment to sharpen the focus of the review so that it explicitly examines how effective the scheme has been in supporting people to accelerate their access to homeownership—people who would otherwise be permanently excluded from homeownership. It's also imperative that this review considers how effectively the scheme is integrating with other first home buyer assistance programs that have been mentioned by various senators in this debate. I know, for example, that here in the ACT the property price caps are excluding more and more people from accessing assistance under the scheme. And I urge the government to actually negotiate on this. We hear publicly that you're open to negotiating, but in private it's flagged that there can be no amendments to this bill. That doesn't sound like negotiation to me. This bill will help more of those people into homeownership, and I urge my Senate colleagues to give this bill consideration and work constructively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Bragg rightly says that this won't solve things. We all know it won't. But his party won't entertain dealing with the root causes of the housing crisis either. They won't touch the capital gains tax discount or even talk about limiting negative gearing—finding a way forward. Their solution is for young people to use their superannuation. So we're going to have a whole generation of young people who have to choose between superannuation and that compounding over their working life, or getting into the housing market. Why should it be an either/or for young Australians? Why can't we actually deal with some of the root causes of this?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, we have to have a debate about immigration. This is putting pressure on people already living here, and new migrants. It's incredibly unfair to arrive into a housing crisis. We have to be able to talk about this and, as Australians, decide how big we want Australia to get. We need to talk about the effect that's having on house prices and look at ideas put forward by people like Alan Kohler, who suggests that we should cap migration and double the completed dwellings every year to ensure that we are keeping up on the supply side.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, the Parliamentary Friends of Affordable Housing and Reducing Homelessness, which I co-chair with Josh Burns and Angie Bell in the other place, hosted Maiy Azize and Everybody's Home for the launch of <span style="font-style:italic;">Voices of the crisis: final report </span><span style="font-style:italic;">from </span><span style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eople's </span><span style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ommission into </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Australia's h</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ousing </span><span style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span style="font-style:italic;">risis</span>. Hon. Doug Cameron and Professor Nicole Gurran did a huge amount of work in getting people together to consult and cooperate. I want to touch on some of the recommendations in the report, in a place where I feel like we hardly ever get to the root cause of these problems. We've got this big balloon in front of us, and we're just seeing little patches being put on whenever there's a leak.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report makes eight recommendations. No. 1 is to invest in a broad-based social housing program. Who doesn't want to see the government invest in more social housing? Here in the ACT we have the highest rate of persistent homelessness in the country, under a Labor-Greens government. We've seen social housing sold off, not replaced. As a Canberran, I find it deeply embarrassing. I actually feel ashamed, looking at our rates of homelessness. On our social housing list, we have 3,100 people waiting for access to social housing. We need the federal government to step up and work with the states and territories and ensure that they make good on their commitments when it comes to social and affordable housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 2 is to recognise housing as a human right. This seems pretty commonsense to me. Is housing a human right, something that we should ensure that everyone in our community has access to, or is it an investment vehicle? When I talk to Canberrans, everyone says, 'Of course it's the first thing.' This is so fundamental to human health and being able to flourish. In fact, I have a bill before the Senate that would seek to enshrine housing as a human right, and I thank Kylea Tink, in the other place, who has introduced the same bill. No. 3 is to ensure housing assistance meets people's needs. We've heard the government talk about the huge increase in Commonwealth rent assistance, but we know that it is still nowhere near enough. At the same time as we talk about these new schemes that the government is putting forward, we can't forget that the NRAS, the National Rental Affordability Scheme, is winding up, and we're seeing thousands of affordable rentals exit the market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 4 is to coordinate national rental reforms that limit unfair rent increases, end no-cause evictions and enact minimum standards. Again, this is something that Australians want in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Build to Rent) Bill, which I assume we'll be debating at some point this week. We've seen a really commonsense proposal from the Community Housing Industry Association, National Shelter and the Property Council. They don't often see eye to eye, but they've worked together to ensure that there are more affordable rentals in the build-to-rent package. Part of that work is adding some conditionality to Commonwealth money, requiring five-year minimum lease agreements and banning all no-cause evictions. It's an opportunity for the Greens and for us, for the first time, to have conditionality on those sorts of tax concessions to ensure that renters have a better deal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 5 is one that, again, the major parties don't want to talk about: abolish the capital gains tax discount and negative gearing for property investors. There are ideas around incrementally reducing the capital gains tax discount on investment properties over the next ten years, phasing out negative gearing, abolishing incentives to downsize the family home, using the revenue savings for investment and supply of well-designed public and community housing that is affordable. We have to be able to actually turn this ship around, and it doesn't have to be an either/or. There are ways to start to address this. Senator Jacqui Lambie and I had a range of options costed by the PBO. There are options out there if the major parties are willing to entertain them. No. 6 is to support affordable homes and sustainable, inclusive communities. No. 7 is First Nations housing justice, which I touched on earlier.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are solutions out there if we are willing to listen to the communities that we come in here to represent, if we're willing to listen to the experts, but that's going to take some political courage. Again, all of these proposals and schemes have their place, but we all know they're not going to solve things, so let's actually get on with this. It's a small thing for people who don't have wealthy parents and who want to get into the market, but let's turn our minds to addressing some of the root causes of this housing crisis.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  The housing crisis we find ourselves in at the moment is one of a number of areas of public policy where Labor has had to step in after almost a decade of inaction by the previous government. The devastating consequences of this are easy to see. In my home city of Hobart, we see increasing numbers of people sleeping in cars and caravans. There are tents pitched in public parks throughout the city, and, even in my own suburb, which is a beautiful seaside suburb, there are tents pitched down by the river. People sleeping rough is just the tip of the iceberg. Our homelessness problem includes people sleeping in emergency accommodation or couch surfing. Many homeless people are lucky enough to have a roof over their heads, but they lack the certainty and stability of permanent accommodation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The social housing waiting list in my home state of Tasmania is now at over 4,700 individuals and families, and the average time for priority applicants—and by this I mean people in the most desperate circumstances—is more than 90 weeks. What we do not see in our homelessness figures is the number of people who are in rental or mortgage stress, those who have permanent accommodation but face the uncertainty of whether they can hold on to it while they struggle to afford the other basics of living. This, as I said, is the legacy of almost a decade of the previous government sitting on their hands while housing affordability got further and further out of reach for so many Australians. Like so many messes left by the previous government through mismanagement and neglect, it has once again fallen to Labor to clean up the mess, and, like so many messes left by the previous government, addressing the legacy of almost a decade of neglect can take a long time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We brought to the election a comprehensive suite of measures that would increase the supply of affordable housing and help more Australians realise the security of a roof over their head. We have continued to add measures, including $6.2 billion in new investment in the 2024 federal budget. The latest measures bring the Albanese government's new housing initiative to $32 billion. Our Homes for Australia Plan will help meet Australia's ambitious goal of building 1.2 million new homes between 1 July 2024 and 1 July 2029.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to building new homes, our plan is also about providing relief for renters and helping Australians own their own homes. The $6.2 billion in new investment in the budget will turbocharge construction, with a $1 billion boost for states and territories to build the roads, sewers and more energy, water and community infrastructure that we need for new homes and additional social housing. It will train more tradies to build the homes Australia needs, with 20,000 fee-free TAFE and pre-apprenticeship places for the housing and construction industry. It will help nearly one million Australian households with the cost of rent by delivering $1.9 billion for the first back-to-back increase to Commonwealth rent assistance in more than 30 years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will provide up to $1.9 billion in concessional finance for community housing providers and other charities to support delivery of the 40,000 social and affordable homes under the Housing Australia Future Fund and National Housing Accord. It will deliver additional funding for the new $9.3 billion National Agreement on Social Housing and Homelessness, which began on 1 July. This includes a doubling of Commonwealth homelessness funding to $400 million every year, matched by the states and territories. It will improve conditions and address overcrowding through an additional $842.8 million investment in remote housing in the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget package also includes working with the higher education sector on new regulations to require universities to increase student accommodation, taking pressure off the rental market; increasing the government's line of credit to Housing Australia by $3 billion and Housing Australia's liability cap by $2.5 billion; and directing $1 billion under the National Housing Infrastructure Facility towards crisis and transitional accommodation for women and children experiencing domestic violence, and youth. This includes increasing the proportion of grants for this investment from $175 million to $700 million to be able to support crisis and transitional housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We announced recently that the first $500 million disbursement from the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund will deliver more than 13,700 social and affordable homes, and these include 1,267 homes for women and children escaping family and domestic violence, and older women at risk of homelessness. In just the first round of the Housing Australia Future Fund, the Albanese government is directly supporting more social and affordable homes than the coalition did in their entire decade in office—in the entire decade that they were in office. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Housing Australia Future Fund and all the other measures I just outlined are about helping Australians to build, rent and buy, and this bill is focused on the last of those three activities. There are many benefits to getting more Australians into homeownership. It gives more Australians the safety, security and dignity of a permanent roof over their heads. It gives Australians more economic freedom, and it helps more Australians gain a foothold in the property capital market. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, over a number of decades the great Australian dream of homeownership has become less and less accessible for low- and middle-income Australians. Forty years ago, almost 60 per cent of young Australians on low and modest incomes owned their own home. By 2022, that figure had fallen to 28 per cent. Twenty-five years ago, average houses cost nine times the average household income. Today it is 16½ times. Renters desperately trying to save for a house deposit are facing a double whammy as a result of rising house prices. Not only do they have to save twice as much for a deposit but increasing rents make that task even more challenging by eating into those potential savings. That is why shared-equity schemes such as the one proposed by this bill are so important to getting more Australians into the housing market. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, when it comes to helping more Australians to own their own home, Help to Buy is not the only measure we are adopting. The government has already helped more than 100,000 people throughout Australia into homeownership through the Home Guarantee Scheme, including through the new Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee. The Home Guarantee Scheme has also been significantly expanded, making it easier for Australians to buy a home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over four years, the Help to Buy scheme will help 40,000 low- and middle-income Australians buy their own home. This is a shared-equity scheme in which only a two per cent deposit is required and which will cut the cost of a mortgage by up to 40 per cent and up to $380,000. As such, Help to Buy helps new homeowners to overcome two hurdles: the hurdle of saving for a deposit and the hurdle of servicing the mortgage. Through Help to Buy, the Australian government will be an equity partner alongside the homeowner. As with state and territory shared-equity schemes, the homebuyer will have the option of buying more equity in the property, if and when they can afford it, and will have the potential to own their home outright. When the property is sold or refinanced, the government as an equity partner will recoup its equity investment plus a share of capital gains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing shared-equity schemes work successfully in the states and territories, but this will be the first national scheme of its kind. All states have agreed at National Cabinet to progress legislation so that the scheme can run nationally. But we can see from the debate leading up to this bill and from the dissenting reports of the inquiry that we're going to see a repeat of all the antics that delayed the Housing Australia Future Fund. Once again, the unholy alliance of the Greens and the coalition will join forces to delay action on affordable housing. They've already voted to delay action by more than six months by referring this bill to an unnecessary inquiry. The bill could have been in place late last year and could have already helped thousands of Australians into homeownership by now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said before in relation to the Housing Australia Future Fund, it's little surprise that the coalition will vote to delay actions on affordable housing. Australians know that they do not care about housing affordability. That much is clear, as I've said, from their almost decade of inaction while in government. The Greens, on the other hand, pretend to care, yet, every time the government seeks to deliver on our election promise, they team up with Mr Dutton and his conservative opposition and apply the brakes. We saw these kinds of tactics in relation to the HAFF, where the Greens delayed and delayed and, in doing so, claimed credit for every Labor housing announcement as if they had extracted some kind of concession from the government. During the delaying of the HAFF, I had a number of former Greens voters speak to me or contact my office to say how angry they were that the Greens were delaying action on affordable housing. And, while the Greens would like to claim that they extracted further investment from us, the truth is this: yes, we announced further funding for our Homes for Australia plan while the HAFF was being delayed, but we also announced significant further funding for our Homes for Australia plan after the HAFF passed the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'll go back to what I said earlier in this speech about $6 billion in additional funding announced in this year's budget. The truth is that we delivered what we would have delivered anyway. The only effect of the Greens' delaying tactic was to make thousands of Australians wait longer for investment in affordable housing. I strongly suspect that the Greens' pretence of caring about Australians struggling to afford their own home is for political, rather than moral, motives. The member for Griffith in the other place, the Greens' spokesperson on housing, made their motives quite clear, in fact, in an article he wrote that was published in February 2023. In this article, Mr Chandler-Mather said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Allowing the HAFF to pass would demobilize the growing section of civil society that is justifiably angry about the degree of poverty and financial stress that exists in such a wealthy country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">'Demobilise': that's what it's about. In the same article, Mr Chandler-Mather revealed that the Greens had launched a doorknocking campaign that was targeted at Labor-held federal electorates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be clear, what the Greens political party were doing with the HAFF and are repeating now with the Help to Buy scheme is to delay implementation for political advantage. How crass can you be? It's the height of irony that, while the Greens claim to be fighting on behalf of homeless Australians and people in housing stress, it's their actions that are getting in the way of helping the very people they claim to be fighting for. For the Greens political party to delay action on affordable housing for political gain is unconscionable, and they should hang their heads in shame. The consequence of delaying this legislation is that 40,000 Australians will take longer to realise the dream of owning their own home. The Greens political party profess to care about giving Australians a roof over their heads, but what do they have to contribute when it comes to actually delivering on affordable housing? Just grandstanding. They follow their grandstanding with criticism, then they follow criticism with delay after delay after delay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens also continue to push their misguided policy of a rent freeze. This is a measure that's been roundly rejected by experts, and I remind the Greens again, as I have before in this place, what some of those experts have said. The Grattan Institute said a rent freeze would 'blunt the incentive to build more housing, leaving us with fewer, poorer quality dwellings'. The Centre for Equitable Housing, in their report on regulation of rents, stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… a "rent freeze", would be a poor response to the real challenges facing Australia's housing system, almost certainly making the problem worse for those in real housing stress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I remind the Greens that these are not the words of property investors or people with a financial interest in extracting more from renters; these are not-for-profit organisations that are dedicated to evidence based housing affordability solutions. I also remind the Greens that both these organisations go on to say that the best way to improve housing affordability is to develop more affordable housing stock—exactly the kind of action the Greens have delayed for months and months in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time for the coalition and the Greens to get out of the way and allow Labor to get on with delivering our election commitment of helping thousands more Australians realise the dream of owning their home. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                    <a href="192970" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:40</span>):  I rise to speak on the Help to Buy Bill 2023. The proposed Help to Buy Scheme is a reckless housing lottery bill that will ultimately increase house prices. In its current form, the Help to Buy Scheme will see the housing crisis get worse. The government will not fix the housing crisis by pushing up house prices, as this bill would do, making it harder for 99.8 per cent of renters every year to buy a home. The government will not fix the housing crisis by giving a lucky few—very few—more cash to bid up the price of housing at auctions. The government will not fix the housing crisis without touching negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount—those massive tax handouts for property investors that deny millions of renters the chance to buy a home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In effect, this Help to Buy Scheme will establish a terrible housing lottery where a maximum of 0.2 per cent of renters would get access to the scheme every year while the other 99.8 per cent would find it even harder to buy a home. Now, it isn't just the Greens contending this. Successive economists and housing experts during the course of the Senate inquiry into this bill made it clear that this bill would push up house prices and would in fact make the housing crisis worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Alarmingly, the federal Treasury acknowledged that they hadn't actually modelled the impact that the Help to Buy Scheme would have on house prices, and the Help to Buy bills themselves lack basic detail on eligibility and other basic key questions on the operation of the scheme. Schemes like Help to Buy allow people to pay more for housing than they otherwise would be able to afford. This ultimately prices people out of housing. The evidence during the Senate inquiry into the bill was clear. This scheme would benefit only a tiny fraction of potential first home owners while increasing house prices for everyone not lucky enough to win Labor's housing lottery through increased demand. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even though this is a small scheme, anything that pushes prices up in the middle of a housing affordability crisis is a step in the wrong direction. Last month my home state of Queensland earned the unenviable title of the homelessness capital of Australia. But it's not just my home state. Millions of people are struggling to pay rent or struggling to pay their mortgages, and they're giving up on ever being able to afford to buy a home. No-one in the 10 most common professions across the country can afford to buy a house and avoid housing stress in some figures that we released recently off the back of PBO costing. This is the devastating reality. Homeownership is completely unattainable for most of the country's essential professions. And how can you save for a deposit when you're stuck paying skyrocketing rents? Meanwhile, the Albanese government has put forward this bill that will push up house prices and help almost no-one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From the moment the bill was introduced, the Greens have been willing to pass the bill if the government negotiated with us on negative gearing and the capital gains discount. Those tax handouts collectively push up the price of housing, which disadvantages renters at auctions. As multiple experts during the inquiry into this bill said, the reality is that we will never tackle the housing crisis until we phase out negative gearing and the capital gains discount. Maiy Azize, who's the spokesperson for Everybody's Home, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Scrapping negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts are not just 'nice to haves' or levers that we could pull, it is absolutely critical if we want to make housing affordable in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr John Quiggin, an economist from my home state of Queensland, where he's a professor of economics at UQ, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These schemes have been around forever, but the money is eventually capitalised into house prices, so the beneficiaries gain at the expense of everyone else.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Matt Grudnoff, who's a senior economist at the Australia Institute, said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Help to Buy scheme, like many previous housing affordability schemes from both major parties, is a policy to boost the financial position of a particular group, usually first home buyers. The problem with these kinds of policies is that they simply increase demand for housing, and this increases the price of housing. The result is that it makes housing less affordable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Peter Tulip, from the Centre of International Studies, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When you stimulate demand, it puts up prices and makes housing more expensive for everybody else.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have a housing affordability crisis, and this makes that problem worse for the majority of people entering the market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a pretty clear sentiment being expressed there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the money saved from phasing out big tax handouts for property investors, we could fully fund the Greens plan to establish a public property developer to build 610,000 good-quality homes to be sold and rented at below market prices. The majority of the public now support capping rents, scrapping tax handouts for property investors and establishing a public developer to build, sell and rent homes at below market prices, so why does Labor keep siding with property investors instead? Labor will give property investors $176 billion in tax handouts over the next 10 years, while millions of renters and mortgage holders suffer. If the government really wanted to tackle the housing crisis, they would listen to the majority of Australians' calls and directly build homes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bottom line is this. There are five million renters in this country, and there are millions more people—including parents of those renters—right now who know that this country is unfair and it's stacked against them, and they're sick and tired of being treated like second-class citizens. Come the next election, I think this government is going to be in for a rude shock when it realises it can no longer keep putting the interests of property developers, property moguls and banks ahead of renters, first home buyers and mortgage holders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens will keep fighting for solutions that will tackle the housing crisis. We'll keep calling for a two-year rent freeze and winding back negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions for property investors because those concessions are denying millions of renters the chance to buy a home. We'll keep calling for the government to reinvest that money in government built homes, sold and rented at prices that people can actually afford. We remain ready to negotiate a housing plan that actually helps the millions of teachers, nurses and early childhood workers who just want an affordable home. We want to negotiate something that will actually help people. But the government is refusing to engage. They are stonewalling us. This is tragic because we are in a terrible housing and rental crisis. It is a crisis of affordability, and it's the direct result of the failure of public policy choices made by successive Labor and Liberal governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The stakes of this housing crisis could not be higher. The latest annual Productivity Commission <span style="font-style:italic;">Report on </span><span style="font-style:italic;">government services</span> shows that there were 57,519 unassisted requests for accommodation from homelessness services last year. Moreover, there are currently over 170,000 households that are on the waiting list for public housing. People's lives are being destroyed because of insecure housing. The government are aware of the effects that experiencing the housing and rental crisis have on every possible measure of an individual's participation in our community, and yet they put a scheme forward that equates to no more than tinkering around the edges—a scheme that would also put upward pressure on housing prices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens want to see the government treat the crisis seriously, and that requires large-scale responses. In particular, we would like to see the government use their vast resources and administrative capacity to directly build homes to rent and sell at below-market prices. We'd like to see the federal government offer the state and territory governments incentives to implement an emergency freeze on rent increases. That could be achieved using a mechanism similar to that outlined in the Help to Buy Bill, which refers powers to the Commonwealth. We'd like to see the government phase out unfair tax handouts, such as negative gearing and capital gains tax, which have significantly inflated the price of housing, denying millions of renters the chance to buy a home. The solutions to the housing crisis require far more than just tinkering around the edges through schemes like Help to Buy. The Greens believe that responding to the housing crisis requires structural change—in particular, phasing out those tax handouts to property investors that encourage property speculation and drive up the cost of housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill, that view was made clear over and over again, along with the need for the government to build far more public housing. Professor Quiggin, who I referred to before, explained that Help to Buy allows the government to appear like they're responding to the housing crisis without spending the money required to do so. In comparing the Help to Buy scheme and the Housing Australia Future Fund, he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… there was an attempt to deliver the desired outcome while pretending that there was no impact on the budget. The fact is that housing is a major capital investment. If the government wants to have more housing, ultimately the only way to do that is programs which would involve a substantial amount of public debt and a substantial amount of real investment. So I think what we're seeing is another piece of gesture politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When asked what policies the government should pursue to respond to the crisis of housing affordability and to ensure that more renters could afford to purchase a home, Mr Grudnoff, who I also referred to earlier, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the most effective policy for housing affordability that the federal government could pursue is to limit negative gearing and scrap the capital gains tax discount. This would discourage property speculators and reduce the demand for housing. It would mean less housing being sold for renting and more housing being sold for owner occupiers. It would increase homeownership rates. This would also raise more than $10 billion per year, which could be used either to build more public housing or for other uses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That call was echoed by Maiy Azize from Everybody's Home, as I referred to earlier. She said that the reforms are essential to responding to the housing crisis. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Scrapping negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts are not just 'nice to haves' or levers that we could pull, it is absolutely critical if we want to make housing affordable in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She went on to explain how both the Labor and the Liberal federal governments have created the housing crisis—in particular, through their decisions to implement or to maintain negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount and to underfund public housing. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the two things that the federal government has done in the past couple of decades to create the crisis that we're in is, firstly, to pull back from supplying housing itself, which it used to do at a much greater scale. About one in three renters actually used to have the government as a landlord and about one in four new builds used to be built by the government. That was key to driving affordability, not just for people on low incomes but across the board. In the decade since, what we've seen is that all the policy levers and investment and incentives have been completely directed at the private sector, which has massively financialised and commodified housing and made it really difficult for house prices to ever come down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The benefits of tax handouts for property investors are going to the wealthiest in our community, who don't need the help from the public purse. The <span style="font-style:italic;">2023-24 tax expenditures and insights statement</span> outlined that 82 per cent of the benefit of the capital gains tax discount was received by the top income decile. At the hearing into this bill, Kristin O'Connell, spokesperson for the Antipoverty Centre, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's quite sickening to be a welfare recipient and have the government consistently tell us that they can't afford to give us enough money to live or to invest in public housing and also see hundreds of billions of dollars being handed out to people who are already wealthy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms O'Connell and Emma Greenhalgh, the CEO of National Shelter, also called for stronger protections for renters from unlimited rental increases. Stronger protections against rental increases would help all potential first home buyers and, unlike Help to Buy, would not push homeownership further out of the reach of the majority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, Help to Buy as it's currently proposed fails to address the underlying causes of the housing affordability crisis in Australia. It aims to assist a small fraction of potential homeowners, and its limited scope and demand side approach are likely to exacerbate the housing crisis without offering any of the solutions that the government knows would work, as they did in the 20th century. This is a deeply unambitious policy introduced at a critical point where homelessness and rental and mortgage stress are skyrocketing. The government has the opportunity to work with the Greens and the crossbench right now to start to address these systemic issues that are forcing more people into housing stress and homelessness. Tinkering around the edges will not help the vast majority of people. The scheme's impact on house prices, although minimal in the broader context of the national housing market, represents a misguided allocation of resources that could otherwise be directed towards more effective solutions to this crisis. Please work with us to get good outcomes for people, rather than trying to force these bills on for a vote when you know they won't pass. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <a href="281603" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MARIELLE SMITH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:55</span>):  I also rise to make a contribution on the Help to Buy Bill 2023 and the Help to Buy (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2023. Here we are again, in this chamber, in the Senate, at an impasse on housing—how absurd. It is absurd we are standing here again with a plan on the table which will make an impact on young people's future and which will make an impact on housing, and yet again we are at an impasse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the biggest issue facing so many Australians but especially young Australians in this country. It is my generation and those younger than us who feel locked out and let down by what is happening in housing in this country, and they are right to feel it. And when they look at debates in our chamber there is no hope for them because there are these constant impasses driven by the coalition on one side, who see political gain in not enough happening here. They're not interested or vested in a positive outcome. They're vested in a political outcome; you can see that in the way they engage in these debates and you can see it in the way they continually show up to this chamber without a better plan on the table, without constructive engagement with the government. On housing, they come into this chamber time after time with one word on their lips: 'no'. They are only doing that because they have an interest in this not working. They should be fronting up instead, working with the government and supporting plans which will make an impact on housing in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier in this debate the coalition were lamenting the fact there aren't enough houses being built in Australia. How many housing plans have they come in here and voted for? What have they done to work constructively with the government to get more houses built in Australia, to drive that investment we know needs to happen not just in social and affordable housing but through the private sector? They have no credibility on this because they never come to these debates and constructively engage to get outcomes on housing to solve this challenge, which sits in the pit of the stomachs of so many young Australians who feel locked out and let down. They're not helped by the Greens, who are also part of this impasse and are more interested in chasing social media engagement than social impact, more interested in chasing clicks than outcomes. They could walk into this chamber, too, and engage constructively. They could engage constructively rather than delay and delay, and block and block.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, yes; young Australians feel locked out and let down. I pity any watching the debate in the Senate today, where there's another plan on the table which would make a difference on this issue—this issue which weighs so heavily on their hearts, their minds and their concerns for their future. Instead of constructive engagement, they see the Senate at an impasse again. They see a plan on the table, they see those opposite saying no and they see those to my side quickly drafting up memes on social media—they're doing the work there!—but not being interested in outcomes, the impact and the change which will make a difference in people's lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear on what this bill does. It's a national shared-equity scheme designed to help more Australians into homeownership, where homeowners can purchase property with just a two per cent deposit. The government will also support eligible homebuyers with an equity contribution—up to 40 per cent for new homes and 30 per cent for existing homes. It will support up to 40,000 low- and middle-income Australians to save hundreds every month on their mortgage. It's a good bill. It's a bill that will make a difference. It is not the whole answer to everything happening in the housing market. It is not the answer to every challenge before us. But it is an answer. It is one pathway. It is one thing that will make a difference. But, like every other bill we've brought to this place and every other plan we've brought to this place, it will be subjected to meme after meme after meme and click after click after click, and we will hear, 'No, no, no, no,' from those opposite, who just aren't interested in engaging.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the Liberals and the Greens vote against these bills in the other place. It's no surprise from the coalition; it's no to everything. That's their political strategy; that's their game plan at the moment. But what about the Greens voting against it? Their election platform called for a shared-equity model, which is what this is, and they're standing in the way of more help for those who want to enter the housing market. They're standing in the way of the ambition and aspiration of young Australians who want to enter the housing market. Let's not skip over the fact that those opposite—the Liberals and the National Party—had a decade in government to address some of the supply issues that we are dealing with in the housing market. They had a decade. This isn't a problem that comes up overnight. They did nothing to boost supply, yet they come in here now, when plan after plan has been put on the table by our government—a government which actually wants to do something and which actually wants to change something—and they say no. Time after time after time, they say no.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard my friend Senator Bragg lamenting earlier in this debate that the policy cupboard of the government is bare. Well, what's in your cupboard, Senator Bragg? What's in the cupboard for the Liberals and Nationals is raiding the superannuation of young Australians. What's in their cupboard is making young Australians choose between their aspiration for homeownership and having decent superannuation and a decent retirement. It's about limiting their ambitions. Well, I don't want to contain the ambitions of young Australians. I think, in a country like Australia, we should be able to say that you can own your own home and you can have a superannuation balance which will help you achieve a safe, secure retirement. I think that's a reasonable aspiration that young Australians should have. That's what the generations before them were able to have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a problem of intergenerational inequity in this country. Limiting the ambition of young Australians and making them choose between homeownership and superannuation—you know full well that, if you rip money out of superannuation from a young person, it's not going to go back. If you start raiding these balances, like they did during the pandemic, it's not going back. So you are making them choose between superannuation and the aspiration to own a home—an aspiration which I think is fair, which their parents had, which their grandparents had and which young Australians should have as well. But they should be able to have superannuation too. It is a false choice. It is a choice that harms young Australians and contains their aspirations. Saul Eslake described it as one of the worst public policy ideas of the 21st century. It is a containment of aspiration, and no-one should fall for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Honestly, watch out, young Australians! If that's what's in their cupboard, you don't want to stay in there long. God knows what's going to fall off the top shelf, if that's the best they've got—if the best they have to offer you is robbing you of your super and limiting your aspirations. This is from a party that claims to be the party of ambition and the party of aspiration. They want to limit the aspirations of young Australians, and no-one in this chamber should stand for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know supply issues are putting pressure on the cost of housing. When house prices increase, saving for a deposit becomes an insurmountable roadblock. We know that homeownership is linked to short-, medium- and long-term economic security. That's why our Homes for Australia plan has an ambitious goal—a rightly ambitious goal—of building 1.2 million homes by the end of the decade. This plan means training more tradies. It means funding more apprenticeships. It means growing the workforce. It means kickstarting construction by cutting red tape and providing incentives to state governments to get homes built quickly, because we cannot do this alone. Anyone who tells you that the federal government can do this alone is having you on. This requires the work, cooperation and collaboration of every single layer of government in our country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are delivering the biggest investment in social housing in more than a decade to help reduce homelessness. For renters doing it tough, we've increased rent assistance two years in a row and we are working with states and territories to make renting fairer. Considerable work is underway, right across our country, including in my home state of South Australia, to improve renters' rights, to improve the bargaining position between them and their landlords, to make it fairer and to make it more secure for them, because not everyone will own a home—not everyone will choose to own a home, actually; some will choose to rent. But the system needs to be fair and equitable, and renters deserve a strong voice in this chamber and across our states and territories as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just today, the minister announced round 1 of the Housing Australia Future Fund programs. Remember the debate on that bill? How many times did we stand in this chamber while the Greens and the Liberals voted no? They voted to delay. Absurd! Well, today we've announced it will deliver 4,000 social and 9,000 affordable homes, including over a thousand homes for women and children escaping domestic violence and for older women at risk of homelessness. That sounds like a pretty sound policy outcome to me—a policy outcome which never would have been achieved without our bill, a policy outcome which others in this chamber tried to block, tried to delay and voted against. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to come together as a chamber in support of action on housing. At the moment, the only party in this place presenting a plan is the government. The parties opposite and the parties to my side come here with a single word on their lips: no. Young Australians should be asking themselves why. Young Australians should be asking themselves, 'What do they have to gain by blocking assistance for those seeking to buy a home and those seeking to rent?' There is a political vested interest here on nothing happening for those opposite. For the Greens, there is an opportunity to engage and there is an opportunity to be part of a solution which will make an impact on the lives of young Australians—an impact on the issue which is sitting heavily on their chests. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Young Australians feel deeply let down when it comes to the housing market. They feel locked out in a way that the generations which came before them did not. Their parents were allowed to have the ambition of a secure retirement and a home. Their grandparents were too. Young Australians deserve to be able to hold that ambition. They deserve a government who backs in that ambition and their aspirations for their future, and they have that government. What they don't have is a Senate chamber willing to put its own politics and nonsense aside and come in and back those young Australians and back reasonable plans in housing which will make a difference to their lives. Instead, here we are again, with the Liberal and National parties, who are seeking to rob young Australians of their aspiration for housing and super and who don't believe they deserve both. The Greens on the other side would rather secure clicks on their social media accounts from young people than vote for a better future for those very young people. That is a depressing state of affairs when it comes to housing policy in this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Young Australians deserve better. All Australians deserve better. As a country, we have the opportunity to make a choice. Do young Australians deserve the same opportunity that their parents and grandparents had to own a home? If your answer to that question is yes, then the only thing you should be doing when you walk into these debates is looking deep inside yourself for how you can constructively engage and deliver policies which will make a difference. I know there is political gain for the Liberals, the Nationals and the Greens in watching these things fall over and fall apart, but, when you do that, you rob young Australians of that security in their future and you rob young Australians of that aspiration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is backing in the aspirations of young Australians. We believe those aspirations should be high. We believe that the millennial generations and those that come after them deserve the same kind of financial security their parents and grandparents had. They deserve to believe they can own a home; it is not asking too much. But they will never get there if the Greens put social media engagement over social impact and if the Liberals and the Nationals sign up to this nonsense idea that they have to choose between owning a home and having a secure retirement through superannuation. That is a false choice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an opportunity to make more progress on housing here in our chamber today. I commend this bill to the Senate. I implore my colleagues to reflect deeply on this and support our bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator TYRRELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:10</span>):  We keep on saying it, but housing is something we really need, so I'm not sure why we are debating the merits of a bill that has been designed to increase the number of houses. The Help to Buy Bill 2023 not only increases the number of houses but helps people to buy a house. Sure, people will share equity with the government, but they will be on the housing ladder. It will give people who need it a hand up to get into the market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who has previously spent time wondering whether I would ever be able to afford a mortgage, I think a bill that helps people buy a house, a home, is a good thing. I'm sure most of those who jump in to apply for the first 10,000 spots will be first home buyers, but I also know this bill will support people on low to middle incomes who need to buy a new place following a relationship breakdown or who are downsizing due to a change in circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This scheme is due to run for four years, meaning 40,000 individuals, families and couples will be helped into a home. About 850 of those spots have been earmarked for Tasmanians. Eight hundred and fifty home purchases over the next four years—that's a whole lot of happy people who can now buy a home, people who thought they may not have been able to or would be saving for a deposit for years to come. And those 850 homes are on top of the home purchases already being supported through the housing scheme that is running in Tasmania.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a good thing, in my book. I know what it's like to be scraping together every cent to try and buy your first home. Back in the day when my youngest was just a baby, I went home when he was three months old so that we could afford a mortgage—so that we could afford to get the money in the bank to purchase a house. I like that the government will contribute up to 40 per cent of the deposit and loan amount for new builds, and 30 per cent for people buying existing homes. The extra 10 per cent means more new houses will be built in Tasmania and all over the country, and that is what we really need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is exactly what I was thinking when I fought to have a minimum guarantee of 1,200 homes built in Tasmania as part of the Housing Australia Future Fund negotiations. Whether they come as a result of this bill or another bill we will debate in the future, new houses are something we should be celebrating. We shouldn't be going around in circles debating, leading to the bill getting further and further away from becoming law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the Greens have called for more support to help people buy a house, yet they are saying no to this bill—a bill that will support more people to buy a home. Go figure! They have a choice to help either 10,000 people or zero people to buy a home, and they're choosing zero, again. I'm getting deja vu from the Housing Australia Future Fund all over again. You can't say you're on the side of helping people with the housing crisis when you vote against bills that do just that. Saying the bill doesn't go far enough won't be a good enough explanation for Tasmanians who are waiting for this scheme to kick in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme draws on policy from a successful housing model in Western Australia, so we already know it has been tested. It takes a long time to save a deposit, find the right place and make sure you have enough for stamp duty and all the legal details. Often it's just for this part of a house purchase that people need help, and then, once they're on the ladder, there's no stopping them. If that happens, and after a few years they decide they want to negotiate their equity terms, they can. They might be able to buy the government out altogether or they might want to keep things plodding along with shared equity with the government. Either way, I am putting up my hand to say this bill is part of the solution we need to start making a dent in the housing crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This won't be a silver bullet to fix everything. We know that the absolute best thing we can do is to build more houses—to build supply to keep up with demand. This will help 10,000 Australians. This will help 850 Tasmanians to achieve their dreams of owning their own house, and, in the words of Darryl Kerrigan, 'It's not just a house; it's a home.' Tasmanians, get your housing dreams in order. It's first in, first served, so make sure you don't miss the boat.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  I rise to speak on the government's Help to Buy Bill 2023 and Help to Buy (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2023, and I thank Senator Tyrrell for her contribution, including quoting the incredible Mr Kerrigan—very well done from Senator Tyrrell!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills form just one part of this government's ambitious housing agenda, and this is an agenda that is absolutely about getting more Australians into their first home. It's an agenda that is about unlocking the investment that is desperately needed to address housing supply and housing affordability in this nation. It is an agenda that is, for the first time in a decade, squarely focused on providing the federal leadership, the Commonwealth leadership, that we need to build more homes and to make them more affordable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposition in front of the Senate today is a simple one, and it is simply to support the aspirations of the 40,000 Australians who we can all assist today to get into homeownership with Help to Buy. It's that simple. It's a simple proposition about helping 40,000 people get into homeownership—the nurses, the teachers, the early childhood educators who could benefit from this scheme. It's about helping older single women who are approaching retirement and who can't afford to get into homeownership right now. It's about helping lower income couples who are trying to get ahead and who need that help to buy their first home. And later in the week, we'll have the chance to help thousands more people into homes too, homes that they can rent through our build-to-rent plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have these two bills in front of the Senate this week, all while we're working to build 1.2 million homes in this country, to build the supply that we desperately need to make homes more affordable in Australia today and to get more people into homes that they can live in and make their lives in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we all know that the coalition does not support building more homes for Australians. They don't have a single policy to build a single new home in this country. And we know that they will not support these bills today. We have their record to look at. We have their record of a decade in government, where, for the majority of that time, they did not even think it was important enough to have a housing minister in this country. They presided over a decade where they did not lift a finger to build a single social and affordable home. They presided over a decade where they were completely missing in action, as we could see this housing crisis grow, as demand for homes clearly outstripped supply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think that the Greens political party would come into this chamber today and direct some of their criticism at the coalition for failing, over a decade, to lift a finger to do anything about housing supply in this country. And you would think that the Greens political party would come into this chamber and work with us today to fix the mess that was left by the coalition, that was left by those opposite. You would think the Greens, with all their talk about housing over the last couple of years, would come into this chamber today and vote for bills to help 40,000 people who really need it into homeownership. You would think that they'd come into this place and vote for bills that will build more secure and affordable rental accommodation, our build-to-rent bills, later in this week too, but they've got form, as you know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You would have thought that they would have supported the Housing Australia Future Fund to invest billions of dollars into social and affordable homes, instead of blocking it and delaying it for months—homes just like the 13,000 homes that we announced today through the Housing Australia Future Fund, homes that could have been on the ground sooner for the people who really need them if the Greens had not played politics and blocked and delayed those homes rolling out. But it's not the Greens' business model or their political model to actually work with the government on constructive solutions. And it's not the Greens' business model to put the criticism where it's due, which is with the coalition for presiding over a decade of absolute denial about what was happening in housing in Australia. Their business model is just to attack the Labor government, who is actually doing something about the housing crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My message to the Greens today, as we look at this Help to Buy Bill and as we look at the build-to-rent bill later in the week, is: sure, attack Labor—we know that that's your business model. We know that that's your political model. We know it's who you are and what you do. But do not attack the 40,000 people who need these homes that we have on the table today. Do not attack those people. Do not attack the single women who are struggling to buy and who would benefit from this Help to Buy scheme. Do not attack the low-income families who would absolutely be able to get into a home under this Help to Buy scheme. Do not attack the essential workers—the early childhood educators, nurses, paramedics and teachers—who rely on this scheme getting through to be able to get that foot in the door and buy themselves a home with these Help to Buy bills. Don't do to those people what you did to the people who rely on the Housing Australia Future Fund. Don't make them wait. Don't get into the business of blocking and delaying. Don't get into the business of playing politics and attacking Labor when what you are actually doing is attacking the very people who will benefit from these bills today—the 40,000 people to whom we want to give a leg-up to actually get into homeownership today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, we know that it's your model to attack Labor. We see it every day in this chamber. We see it in the pointless motions that get put forward. We see it in the jawboning political performances of the spokespeople of the Greens political party. We see all of that. But you have the chance to do something real, something that will actually impact people and will actually get 40,000 people—people who would not otherwise get into a home—into a home by supporting these bills. So attack the Labor Party all you like. Attack the Labor government all you like, but do not throw under the bus the 40,000 Australians who would benefit from these bills, get a leg-up, get a foot in the door and be able to buy their own homes. Do not do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen what happened with the Housing Australia Future Fund. We've been able to announce 13,000 homes that are going to mean so much for people—so much social and affordable housing being provided to people that would have been provided sooner if the Greens had not blocked and delayed those homes. So I appeal to the Greens to pass these bills and support our Help to Buy legislation, because the Greens know that each and every housing measure makes a huge difference to people's lives. We all know that we need to get on with building 1.2 million homes over the next five years. We all know we need to help people into homeownership, and we all know that shared-equity schemes like Help to Buy are an absolutely critical way of doing just that. So the message to the Greens is to just get this done. Just get this done!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a scheme that will give thousands of people a leg up to buy their first home, because we know that servicing a mortgage and pulling together a deposit are two of the largest hurdles to homeownership. This scheme directly tackles that. It will see 40,000 Australians moving into their first home sooner. In partnership with a panel of lenders and the state and territory governments, the federal government will provide equity contributions of up to 30 per cent for existing homes. To support housing supply efforts, first home buyers will be further incentivised with a 40 per cent contribution for new builds. We want to encourage more new builds because that is critical to supply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This scheme will genuinely help those who have, for too long, been just out of reach of homeownership. It will help because all that is needed is a deposit of two per cent to get involved—just two per cent, with the backing and security of the government. That is life changing for people. It will cut off years of saving for people. It will cut off years of effort they have to put into pulling together a deposit. It will fast-track homeownership for so many people, making what is just a dream for some a reality. That's what we have in front of us in the chamber today, a practical measure, a practical step that we can take to get more people—good people, good Australians, worthy people—into their first homes. The scheme has been set up appropriately. There are price caps and targets for eligibility. Help to Buy will avoid inflating house prices and making the situation worse, and it will absolutely be directed at supporting those who need it most.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw all of that. We saw all of its support in the Senate economics committee inquiry, which I chaired, into the Help to Buy scheme. The evidence could not have been clearer. We heard from AHURI. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We certainly would like to see the bill passed. Shared equity programs have been some of the … most effective housing policy interventions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the Senate inquiry, Housing Industry Australia said these bills are 'an important part of the mix to address our current housing shortages'. We also heard from housing advocacy group Everybody's Home. They said they 'support shared-equity models as they improve access to housing for those who need it'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Greens political party is no housing expert, it even supported shared-equity schemes when it suited them to do so. A shared-equity model was, in fact, part of their 2022 election platform, but, provided with the option to establish one, they're actually standing in the way, which only makes the case again that this is about the Greens' business model, this is about the Greens' political model, and this is not about practical housing outcomes for Australians. That's the Greens for you: attack your own policy if it gives you a vehicle to attack the Australian Labor Party. So, again, for 40,000 people, this Help to Buy scheme will be life changing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the opportunity in the Senate this week to help those people. This is targeted at worthy Australians who deserve to have the opportunity to get into their own home. It's targeted at people like older women struggling to buy a home. It's targeted at our essential workers, like our early childhood educators, paramedics and nurses, to get them into homes they can afford with small deposits and smaller mortgage repayments backed by the government. This is targeted at low-income families to help them get a foot in the door of a home they can call their own.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we expect the Liberals and the rest of the coalition to oppose these measures. They had a decade to do something about housing supply, and they were missing in action the entire time. The Greens, on the other hand, talk a good game about housing. This is their opportunity to actually take a practical step and do something about it. This is their opportunity to help 40,000 people get into their first home, and they know that this is one of a suite of measures that we are putting in place to deliver more homes, and more affordable homes, for Australians. We know the only reason the Greens are opposing this is that it is their business model. Attack us all you like. Don't attack the people who need these homes right now.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0U" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON-YOUNG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:30</span>):  I rise today to contribute to the debate on the Help to Buy Bill 2023 and the Help to Buy (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2023, and I obviously endorse all of the comments of my Greens colleagues who've spoken before and those who will speak after. This issue is a fundamentally important one. An issue of debate in this place is how we can help those who are doing it pretty tough right now, and, rather than debating a piece of legislation that really gets to the heart of what is going on with the housing market in Australia, we've just heard speech after speech from members of the government whingeing and whining rather than doing and acting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You'd be forgiven for thinking, given the speech made just previously, that this government has an opportunity to work with anyone. I listened very carefully to the Prime Minister's press conference this morning. Rather than being prepared to work constructively, negotiate responsibly and put in all the effort to try and get agreement across the chamber, what the Prime Minister said was, 'Get out of the way.' That is the type of attitude that is coming right from the top of this government—'Get out of the way'—as if somehow everyone in this democratically elected chamber should just roll over and get out of the way. I'm sorry, Mr Prime Minister, but that's not actually how democracy works, and it's not actually representative of this chamber. The Labor government has 25 votes in this place, out of 76, yet it has the arrogance to just whinge, whine, politick and demand that everybody else get out of the way. I think people who are really struggling to pay their rent right now and are holding their breath at another potential rate rise—certainly not a rate cut any time soon—would like a bit more cooperation and maturity from this government than just telling everybody else to get out of the way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is extremely disappointing that today the government have brought on these bills and want to force a vote on bills that they know will lose. They know they don't have the support of the chamber, because they haven't put in the effort. They haven't actually done the hard work of trying to come to a workable solution. They're not interested in negotiating with anyone else. When you have a Prime Minister whose attitude is that the rest of the chamber and the parliament should just get out of the way, that is not the attitude of a leader who wants to get things done and work collaboratively or who is listening to the very real concerns of members of the community right across the country who are struggling right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that I would love to be able to be in this place today talking about a bill, a piece of legislation, that would actually go to dealing with the issues that people are feeling—a bill that would actually deal with the cost of housing in this country and with offering some relief for the millions of Australian renters who can hardly pay the week-in, week-out rent, let alone save for a deposit for their own home. But this piece of legislation is totally inadequate. Rather than the government working with the Greens, the crossbench and others in this chamber to improve and deliver real solutions for people, we have a piece of legislation that is effectively useless. It does nothing to deal with those real issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This piece of legislation is like bringing a spoon to a gunfight. It's not even a knife; it's a spoon, being used to serve up some political rhetoric from the government while they refuse to put in the hard yards to compromise and to work collaboratively, when in fact that's actually what the Australian people want. Over and over and over again, we hear this. There's a reason that the Labor Party had their lowest vote on record since World War II at the last election. There's a reason that more and more Australians are not voting for either of the major parties: they're sick of the winner-takes-all attitude that delivers no solutions for people. That's why they want governments to have to work with others, to come up with workable solutions, good solutions, and to listen to the needs and the concerns of people in the community. But no; the Prime Minister just wants everyone to get out of his way. The political posturing, the whinging and the whining without actually putting in any of the effort—Australians can see right through that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, this piece of legislation is so inadequate that it might help two per cent of people if they're lucky—sorry; 0.2 per cent of people, if they're lucky. That means that 99.8 per cent of Australians, who might some day love to own a home, are being left in the lurch, totally locked out of this. This proposed Help to Buy scheme would help only 10,000 Australians—0.2 per cent—while 5½ million adult renters per year would get nothing out of this. In fact, it could actually make the situation worse, because house prices will continue to climb, locking more and more and more people out of the housing market. People are finding life pretty tough right now, whether you're a renter or you have a mortgage. The cost of living is getting harder. The cost of everything is going up. It's becoming harder and harder for people to keep their heads above water.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say to members of the community, whether you're a renter or a mortgage holder: if you feel that you're doing it really tough right now, you're not alone. Millions of others are feeling the same. That's why we in the Greens are so upset that this government is refusing to do some important things to relieve the pressure on you. It's why it's so frustrating that this government, rather than working for solutions, continues to try and bulldoze its rubbish bills through this place. When you go to the supermarket, everything costs more. Every month, people are worried that their landlord's going to put the rent up again. When you hear the Governor of the Reserve Bank telling people that they might have to sell their homes, that's just a kick in the guts—an absolute kick in the guts—for people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Michele Bullock, only a couple of weeks ago, said that people would have to start cutting back on their spending, trading down to lower quality goods and services, dipping into their savings and working some extra hours and that, ultimately, they might have to sell their homes to keep their heads above water. This is not leadership. This is capitulation to the crisis and to the system that's not working for people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some key things that in this place, this parliament, if there was a will, if the government was willing to work with us, we could get done. We could put a two-year freeze on rent increases so that people can at least catch their breath. We could get rid of the hugely generous tax incentives for property developers that continue to push housing prices through the roof. The big property developers don't care. They are not feeling it right now. It's young people, mums and dads and everyday working Australians who are struggling to keep their heads above water.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government doesn't want to deal with that. They're too scared to confront the key causes of this housing crisis, because they don't want to upset their mates in the property industry. The statistics are just gobsmacking. If you are a childcare worker, there's no way you can possibly afford to save enough for a deposit to buy a house these days. In fact, it would take you 31 years to save for a deposit. Even then, if you got a loan today, it would be over 90 per cent of your wage. This is not realistic for people. Yet this piece of legislation does nothing to relieve that pressure or deal with that issue. If you are a sales assistant and work in retail, which so many Australians do—it's the most common profession in this country—you will never be able to afford a house on the current track. You will never be able to do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This piece of legislation, this wet lettuce to the housing crisis, does nothing to help you. Rather than the government working with the Greens, the crossbenchers and others in this parliament to deal with this issue, to put some solutions in place that will help people with the skyrocketing cost of rent and the unaffordability of housing, the government is not interested in that. It's all about a headline. It's all about making them feel like they have done something rather than actually doing something.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In South Australia, my home state, Adelaide was named one of the world's most unaffordable housing markets. That's in the world. This piece of legislation does nothing to help that. This legislation does absolutely nothing to help that. If you are a renter in Adelaide, according to monthly data from private analytics company PropTrack, Adelaide has the worst rental availability of any capital in Australia. So, if you're in Adelaide right now and you're feeling like you can't find an affordable rental, it's true; you can't. You're not alone, because so many other South Australians are dealing with the same issue. But I tell you what: this government is not helping you. They are leaving you on your own. This government is failing to help you because of its arrogance and inability to understand that the Australian people want this government to cooperate, to feel the pressures people are under and to put the politics aside and get something done that delivers real relief for people. Rents in Adelaide homes rose by 11 per cent last year. These bills do not help with that. The Albanese government is leaving South Australians in the lurch. It is ignoring them.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  Sometimes in this chamber I really struggle to accommodate the hubris and the fantasies painted by some colleagues who participate in these debates and the deliberate misinformation, the deliberate failure to tell the truth and the determination to give Australians—who are people of hope and endeavour—all the bad news about how things are ruined, how impossible it is. I'm the daughter of Irish immigrants who arrived with nothing. I know how hard it is to get a house. My parents took me home to a caravan. They worked really hard and they finally achieved their dream of getting a house. It's a big deal. It's built on the back of hope and hard work, and a bit of a hand when you need it, instead of all the huffing, puffing and negativity and game playing that is going on in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's remember: a couple of years ago there was a change of government and the Albanese Labor government was elected to fix up a big problem we knew we had with housing. It's not a new one; it's been going on for a really long time. So, lest people become disheartened by the contributions of the Liberal-Green alliance going on here—the Liberal Party and the Nationals are joined up as usual, but this time they've added the Greens to their wall of negative noise to drive hope from the hearts of Australian people and tell them there is nothing to help them. But that is a complete misrepresentation: there is help. There has already been help in housing. We could topple that wall of negativity, that wall of oppression, that wall of despair, and get some legislation through this place. We're already hearing from speakers from the Greens and the Liberals, 'Oh no, we are not going to let this through.' Every day they delay, they make it harder for people who want to get a decent house, to begin their journey, to create somewhere safe to raise their family—and maybe they'll also come on holidays to Canberra and come here into the chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to be clear: we already know that, as the Labor Party in government, we have brought a whole series of commitments to housing. So far, we've put $10 billion into the Housing Australia Future Fund to build 30,000 social and affordable homes. That's a lot of people. That's the goal—to get 30,000 that way. But that's not all we're doing. There's the $2 billion Social Housing Accelerator to deliver 4,000 social homes. There's the $3 billion New Homes Bonus to incentivise the states to build homes faster. There's the build-to-rent scheme we've been trying to get support for. We've helped more than—and in all the despair and negativity and 'woe is the world', there are really good stories for—get this number: 110,000 people, who we've helped into their own home through the expanded Home Guarantee Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we're here talking about a particular scheme to make sure that we assist people who really are finding it difficult to get enough money together. Instead of leaving them lingering, thinking they can never get into a house, the government has decided with this legislation to help people on low incomes get some equity from the government to help them get in on the ground and begin their housing journey. It's not a trap. It's a path to freedom. It's an opportunity and a chance for hardworking young and older Australians who find themselves in a situation where they haven't got a wealthy aunt, uncle, mother or father. Who are they going to look towards to get a little bit of help to get them on their homeownership journey? They're looking to the Labor government. That is what we are doing in here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the back of our win at the last election, we're continuing to deliver on housing and the commitments we've made across a whole range of areas. Today we are bringing in legislation. And what have we got on that side? What did Peter Dutton say? Let me see if I can find his exact quote—because I don't want to misquote him! Peter Dutton says about this legislation to help Australians get into their houses:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… Labor's home buying scheme would see Australians rely on other taxpayers' money to purchase their home. Perversely, the government would then have equity in their home. That's not liberating—it's modern collectivism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He should say that to people who are really struggling to pay their rent. Peter Dutton doesn't think your government should help you when you're in trouble. Peter Dutton says, 'No, no; this is not for you.' He's not speaking to people with a wealthy mum or dad. He's speaking to people who haven't got that opportunity or support. He's saying that the type of government that he leads will never help you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But Labor is determined to assist you. That is why we have brought forward, once again, this Help to Buy scheme to ensure that Australians who have got a little bit together and have worked and struggled to get enough together can begin. The government says: 'We will stand with you. We will stand beside you. We won't just talk at you, flapping our gums.' That's what we've got here. They're bleeding hearts with crocodile tears, feigned sympathy and feigned empathy. All the while there is a determination to build a wall between you and the house that you could get if Labor could only get this legislation through the Senate. That is why I say to senators: don't just get out of the way, which is a phrase that's been used in the most ridiculous way by the previous contributor to this debate. Pull the bricks down one at a time. Give them to the Australians who want to put the bricks one on top of the other to build their homes. Give them a chance. That's all most Australians want—a fair go and a chance. If they need a little help from their government to get into the property market, then Labor understand that we can make an arrangement with you of that kind. We can have a bit of equity as a government, using taxpayer money, to help you get on the property ladder.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's in contrast with Mr Dutton. You will have heard some of the debate saying: 'The states aren't on board. It's a big problem. It's impossible to deliver.' They're always with the problems and never with the solutions. They're always with the negativity and never with the hope. They're always with the no and never with the yes. That's what we are seeing. The Liberal and National Parties and the Greens together are always in the way of progress. Today is another example. David Crisafulli—you might have heard his name; he's the Queensland LNP leader—said this on 14 March: 'Programs that allow equity, like Help to Buy, are something that are firmly in our focus, and I want to work with Canberra to make sure the numbers we're talking about are far higher.' At least he's got a better idea than Mr Dutton.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As soon as Dominic Perrottet, former Liberal New South Wales Premier, heard about it, he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Key workers, single parents and older singles will be able to have the security of home ownership with a lower upfront deposit, a smaller loan, lower repayments, no lenders mortgage insurance and no interest on the Government's equity share in a property.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That doesn't sound like a really bad thing to me. Let's just break it down. The former Liberal Premier of New South Wales says that this helps older people, single parents and key workers get in and have the security of homeownership. It'll make sure that they have lower upfront deposits, because sometimes it's really hard to get that savings nest together. And, if the government shares the loan with them, they'll have a smaller loan. Dominic Perrottet got it. If they've got a smaller loan, guess what? They'll have lower repayments. Dominic Perrottet got it, but Mr Dutton and everybody who is sitting on that side of the chamber, and those here, around in the Greens' seats, still don't get it. Today they're standing up and making a song and dance because they think they might be able to get a few extra votes if they whinge enough and make Australians despair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dominic Perrottet noted that if this scheme gets up there will be no need for a lenders mortgage insurance. Importantly, he immediately saw that sharing the debt on a house at an affordable level that you can manage with a government is an important contribution and an important cooperative model of making sure people get into houses, because there is no interest on the government's equity in the property, and that's how it's supposed to work. You don't give up your dream. You work hard and save. You get enough money together—a little bit of money, enough to get yourself in there—and you go to the government and say: 'Look, I'm working hard. I'm saving hard. I need a place for me and my family. If you put up some of the money here, I can get into the housing market.' And that's what this is about. A lot of fancy words are going to get thrown around, and there will be a lot of huffing and puffing, but Dominic Perrottet made it really clear that all of the elements of this make sense to ordinary people who don't come in here and make the sort of noisy nonsense that we're hearing from the Greens and the Liberal and National parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dominic Perrottet got it, and so did Matt Kean, the former New South Wales Liberal Treasurer. He said a shared equity scheme 'will help those facing significant barriers to homeownership buy their own place sooner'. That's a good thing; at least, it is in my book. I cannot understand why the Greens political party and the Liberal and National parties can't understand how important it is to give people this opportunity and hope.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They should be listening to a few people who have something to say to them. Chantel from Darling Heights, in the electorate of Groom, said: 'Without assistance like this, the chance of re-entering homeownership while being a renter is slim to zero.' Chantel gets it. Why can't you guys get it? Yvonne from Forestdale, in the electorate of Wright, said, 'My husband and I are currently renting, but we're expecting a newborn in May 2024.' I hope that that's all going well for you, Yvonne. She said, 'We want to have the security of our own place to grow our family.' And you should be able to do that. You should be able to do that, Yvonne—you and your husband and your new baby. But the people who are standing between you and that dream are the people in this chamber who continue to block this piece of solid legislation that Labor got elected to deliver. We got elected to do this. They need to let the legislation through. They need to vote yes and not no, just for a change.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:00</span>):  I rise to speak to the Help to Buy Bill 2023, and I endorse the comments of my fellow Greens on this bill. Right now, the housing system in Australia is stacked in favour of property investors, banks and property developers, and this is not about a lack of ambition or optimism, as the previous speaker suggested; it's about the reality that faces people now, a reality completely different from my reality as a young person approaching the housing market decades ago and from our forebearers and what they had put together in the housing market. It is so different now. Just look at the tax concessions set to cost the public purse $176 billion over the next decade, firing up the housing demand and taking housing out of the realm of possibility for so many Australians who work diligently to save money every week and look at the possibility for them to own a house just drifting away into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the number of vacant properties that are left empty by developers to help drive up the price of housing. Housing policy in this country is geared towards pushing up housing prices, and the bill before us today is no different. It is more of the same. The Labor government may acknowledge that we are in the middle of a housing and rental crisis but their inaction and their inadequate and very poor policies speak louder than their words. We want to engage with Labor. We want to find a better way forward, a meaningful way of fixing the crisis, not a leg-up for a small number that will actually pour fuel on the fire rather than address the problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the country, millions of renters are struggling to keep their heads above water with house prices and mortgages only continuing to soar. The Help to Buy scheme is like throwing a bucket of water onto a house fire—</span>

                    </a>  or taking a spoon to a knife fight, as my colleague just said. As we heard further from Senator Hanson-Young, it is a scheme that will help the 0.2 per cent of people lucky to get access to it but will deliver nothing to the 99.8 per cent for whom it will make things worse by driving up prices even further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill was taken to a Senate inquiry where a lot of expert evidence was given that this will push up house prices. My colleague Senator Waters pointed to some of it. Professor John Quiggin, professor of economics at the University of Queensland, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These schemes have been around forever, but the money is eventually capitalised into house prices, so the beneficiaries gain at the expense of everyone else.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senior economist Matt Grudnoff said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The problem with these kinds of policies is that they simply increase demand for housing, and this increases the price of housing. The result is that it makes housing less affordable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to be taking real steps to address the housing and rental crisis, not tinkering and not making the problem worse. Two-thirds of people in Australia are in housing stress according to a report from Everybody's Home. That means they are spending more than 30 per cent of their income on housing. Housing affordability is worsening, hurting those paying off their mortgages, those saving for deposit, renters and people who can't afford to put a roof over their heads. Affordable rentals for households on the minimum wage have decreased 81 per cent over the last five years. According to the ABS, rents have increased at nearly double the rate of wages over the last year alone, putting millions of renters under significant financial stress and making it impossible for many to ever save enough to buy a home in the first place. This is pushing more people into homelessness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The homeless rate in Australia, to our great shame, remains amongst the highest in OECD countries. It increased by five per cent between 2016 and 2021. That's an additional 6,000 people sleeping rough—sleeping outside and denied a basic human right of shelter. The only way we're going to solve this crisis is if the government steps in and starts building hundreds of thousands of homes itself. We want to work with Labor to get that kind of solution underway, and we don't want to do it by fuelling demand through policies that don't touch the sides.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's policies will not address the depth of the crisis that we are facing. Help to Buy is a demand-side housing policy. It enables people to pay more for housing than they otherwise would be able to afford, and this guarantees a steady flow of capital into the housing market with limited supply. Inevitably, that pushes up prices. This is economics 101. Most Australians do not benefit from housing policies like this. In fact, only 0.2 per cent of Australians will be eligible for this scheme. So this scheme will actually make people worse off: the new home buyer, paying more for housing and being saddled with an impossible amount of debt; people trying to enter the housing market and finding the start line further and further out of reach, taking more and more time to save for a deposit; and those renting, on the verge of homelessness or homeless already, who face greater costs for housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The key group that benefits is investors. They rely on the rapid increase in house prices to ensure a return that's quick. They turn around their investments quickly and reap the benefits. The coalition loves demand-side solutions like this too. Just look at the first home buyer grant and the coalition's HomeBuilder scheme. These policies do not improve housing affordability for the vast number of Australians locked out of, or struggling with the cost of, housing. Demand-side solutions drive up prices and push the cost of housing out of reach for millions of Australians. Housing affordability is a huge problem affecting millions—in particular, women, young people, single parents, the unemployed, older renters, young renters and people with disabilities. The issues are widespread and big. Making housing affordable for all Australians will require much more comprehensive reform than we see in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Housing costs in my home state of South Australia are no different to the national picture and, in some cases, are much worse. Over the 14 years to 2020, Anglicare SA recorded a staggering 99 per cent increase in rental stress across South Australia. According to a recent Anglicare report, a single person on a parenting benefit living in South Australia, even when they are willing to share, could not afford any of the 1,600 properties advertised for rent—not one. Even for a working couple on minimum wage, 85 per cent of the rentals in Adelaide would be unaffordable. Rents in Adelaide are now increasing faster than anywhere else in Australia, with a 60 per cent increase over the last four years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As South Australia's social housing stock has declined over the past decade or so, there has been a corresponding increase in homelessness. I see evidence of this every time I take a walk in the South Parklands, as I did on Saturday. The growing number of bright blue tents brings home the reality that ordinary South Australians are now faced with skyrocketing rents and unaffordable mortgage payments, forcing too many onto the streets, into the parklands and sleeping in their cars. It's a frightening prospect to lose your home, but we're seeing more and more South Australians slipping through the net. Over 184,000 families are on public housing waiting lists nationwide, and there are 4,000-odd in South Australia. This is pushing those on low incomes into homelessness, and we need comprehensive solutions, not bandaids that make the problem worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rise in Adelaide house prices is more than double the national average, while repayments on a median dwelling have increased by almost $2,000 a month since 2022. It is beyond contention that housing tax concessions, including negative gearing and capital gains tax, are pushing house prices ever higher and out of reach of the most common occupations in Australia. If a primary school teacher began saving for a home deposit today it would take until 2036 to save a 20 per cent deposit on a median priced home. If a full-time childcare worker took out a home loan today they would need to spend 92 per cent of their income on repayments, assuming an 8.8 per cent interest rate. And a nurse would have to spend 50 per cent of their income servicing a home loan. It really should not be this hard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's so-called plan to tackle the housing crisis is to rely on profit-hungry developers to build expensive homes that too few can afford and to give billions of dollars in tax handouts to property investors, which deny millions of renters the chance to buy a home. On the other hand, we in the Greens have a comprehensive plan to tackle the housing crisis: capping rent increases, scrapping the tax handouts for property investors that go to so many on high incomes, and investing billions in building hundreds of thousands of good-quality homes to be sold and rented at prices that Australians can afford.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Investor housing tax concessions set to cost $176 billion over the next decade are helping to push housing prices up in capital cities. They've gone up by 34 per cent since 2020. These handouts are $176 billion worth of fuel that Labor is pouring on the raging fire that is Australia's housing crisis. Until Labor scraps them, we will never get this crisis under control. The reality is that we'll tackle the crisis until we phase out that negative gearing, the capital gains discount and the massive tax handouts for property investors. With the money saved from phasing out those tax handouts we could fully fund the Greens' plan to establish a public property developer to build 610,000 good-quality homes to be sold and rented at below-market prices. This would save an average renter who is participating in the program $5,200 in rent annually and the average first home buyer $260,000 on the price of a home. Our policy would transform the lives of millions of people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what about those who can't afford to buy a home? Across this country there are seven million renters who are in precarious renting arrangements. They are unable to push back against unfair rent hikes and dodgy landlords and agents who don't do basic repairs. The system is stacked against renters, and they need someone in their corner to fight for them. That's why we want to establish a national renters protection authority to enforce national tenancy standards and establish a national renters protection structure. It will have the power to independently investigate breaches of rental law, fine individual landlords and real estate agents for breaching renters' rights and refer serious offenders for prosecution in states and territories. Along with proactive investigations targeted at compliance with new rent caps and rights to lease renewal on minimum standards, that authority would be the first port of call for renters nationwide and would be a major assistance to those who are renting. Right now, around most of Australia, there is zero protection against unlimited rent increases and nothing to stop renters from being forced to move every year without warning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor are the party of property investors and private developers, and we are standing for renters and first home buyers and are asking Labor to listen to our proposal to reconsider a plan that doesn't meet the crisis as we face it. We need to do so much better. We are a wealthy country and we can put a roof over everyone's head in our nation. We can enforce rent caps and freeze rents. Australian renters are insecure and powerless compared with those in many other countries, and we need to improve protections for renters rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's face it, developers will always put profit before social service, so we must agree that there is a level of market failure right now and we must have the full and comprehensive solutions that deal with it. Government policy that drives up house prices is a choice. It's the wrong choice. It's not one we in the Greens intend to make. Housing should be a basic social right, not a source of wealth accumulation. We can put a roof over everyone's head, and that should be the goal of housing policy in Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="168275" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHELDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:14</span>):  I rise to speak on the Help to Buy Bill 2023. This bill is how a lot of policies in this country work: the Liberals and Nationals, either intentionally or by their own recklessness and incompetence, create a crisis—in this case, the housing crisis. As the CEO of Homelessness Australia, Kate Colvin, has said: 'There's no disputing that the previous federal government left an absolute mess in the housing system.' So the Liberals create a crisis; the Australian people vote them out; Labor comes in with a sensible, evidence based solution to the crisis; and the Greens, rather than working constructively with the government to deliver in the best interests of the country, decide to hold up the solutions so they can put out media releases complaining that nothing is getting fixed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we have a situation where it's almost a year since this bill, Help to Buy, was introduced to parliament, and we are still debating it rather than getting on with this policy, because we are blocked, on the one hand, by the Liberals and Nationals, who created this crisis to begin with and who say no to everything, and the Greens party, who say they care about solving the crisis but who, the problem is, care even more about campaigning about the crisis. The Liberal and National parties and the Greens party are two sides of the same coin. All are putting their own political interests before the national interest. It is a disgrace, when you have people living in their cars, living in tents, living on the street, for political parties to put their own grandstanding before providing more homes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's Help to Buy Scheme is very simple. If we pass this bill, it will support up to 40,000 Australian households to purchase a home of their own. The federal government will invest in up to 40 per cent of the purchase price for new homes and 30 per cent for existing homes. So you will only need to get a mortgage for 60 or 70 per cent of the purchase price, which means the amount you need to save for a deposit is considerably lower. This bill is a lifeline for those who do not have wealthy parents to ask for a leg-up, for a deposit. The bill also means that, because your mortgage is considerably smaller, your repayments are considerably smaller. So not only does it make the home more affordable to save for; it makes it more affordable to pay off. This bill makes housing attainable for tens of thousands of Australian families who otherwise might never own their own home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are caps on income and property value, to ensure that this scheme is really targeted at those who need it most. It's a principle you would think everyone could get behind—and you'd be right to think it, because the Greens party even supported a shared equity scheme in their own political platform taken to the last election. The Greens political platform says: 'The Greens will establish a shared ownership scheme to help people currently locked out of the market to own their first home.' It's right there in black and white. The Greens tell the Australian people they support a shared equity scheme to deal with the housing crisis, but, when it gets to the Senate, they hold it up so they can complain that there is nothing being done!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not only the Greens who are fighting against themselves over this bill. Their partners in crime are the Liberal Party, who can't agree about their position on this bill either. Former New South Wales Liberal premier Dominic Perrottet was a big fan of Labor's shared equity scheme. In fact, he was such a big fan that he copied it in his own 2022 state budget. Premier Perrottet said at the time:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I understand the federal Liberal Party opposed Prime Minister Albanese's scheme [but] I think it makes sense … providing equity support for first-time buyers …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And he went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Key workers, single parents and older singles will be able to have the security of home ownership with a lower upfront deposit, a smaller loan, lower repayments, no lenders mortgage insurance and no interest on the Government's equity share …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are, of course, shared equity schemes in place in a number of states, including Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. In Tasmania, the Liberal government recently expanded their shared equity program because it was so popular. The Tasmanian Liberal housing minister has said their shared equity scheme:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… has shown itself to be an incredibly popular program that is supporting Tasmanians to enter private home ownership …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know Mr Dutton thinks that Liberals down south are a bunch of dirty lefties. That's why he's just completed a hostile factional takeover of the New South Wales branch. But what do his own Queensland colleagues say? The Queensland LNP leader turned around and had some comments about a shared equity program just three months ago. He said: 'Programs that allow equity are something that is firmly in our focus, and I want to work with Canberra to make sure that the numbers that we're talking about are far higher.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just state Liberal leaders who support shared equity schemes. Let's look at what recent federal Liberal leaders have had to say about them as well. Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has supported this approach for over 20 years. In 2003, he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… by allowing homeowners to use equity as well as debt finance, homeowners will benefit from a lower cost of home ownership …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, the current Liberal leader, Mr Dutton, ran a very long and nasty campaign to undermine and sack Mr Turnbull. Unfortunately for him, his own caucus colleagues said they would rather have Scott Morrison as leader than Mr Dutton. I won't reflect on what this tells us about how the opposition leader's own colleagues view him, but what did former prime minister Morrison say about shared equity schemes? In 2017, as Treasurer, Mr Morrison said the Victorian shared equity scheme was 'very interesting'. I think: good on them for having a good crack at this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is all pretty astonishing. You've got the Greens party voting against a policy that was taken to the last election on their own platform, and you've got the Liberal Party voting against a policy that is supported by their two most recent federal leaders and most, if not all, of their state leaders. That really tells you all you need to know. There's no real debate to be had about whether this bill would help people to own their own homes. We know the policy works, because there are already very successful versions of it in a number of states. The Liberals and the Greens—the Tories and the tree Tories—would rather just see housing remain unaffordable so that they can complain about it. It's one of the most disgraceful things I've seen in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do worry about the infighting in the Greens party on housing. It seems they can't agree on their own position. They support shared equity schemes, but then they also oppose them. Their platform calls for the building of one million new homes, but their housing spokesperson spends most of his time campaigning against new developments near his own house. In the last two years alone, the Greens housing spokesperson has opposed a plan to build 855 mixed-purpose dwellings at the disused Bulimba Barracks site. He's campaigned against a 220-home aged-care facility in Holland Park. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the Greens member for Griffith who opposes any new homes being built near his own house. In Sydney the Greens are opposing the Minns Labor government's plan to build new affordable homes near train stations. The Greens member for Balmain says that building up to 185,000 new homes would be 'unlikely to have a meaningful impact' and would, rather, 'further threaten our tree canopy targets'. At the very same time it was reported last year that one of the Greens New South Wales senators planned to bulldoze thousands of trees in order to subdivide their Port Macquarie investment property into three luxury rentals. Can you believe it? The Greens oppose affordable homes near train stations because of tree canopy targets, but they have no problem with bulldozing trees to subdivide their own investment properties. And it goes on and on. The Greens member for Brisbane opposes an empty sand and gravel factory in Teneriffe being turned into residential apartments because it would impact 'the unique character of the neighbourhood.' It is remarkable. The Greens want to build one million homes—just as long as they aren't anywhere near their own homes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then you've got the Greens housing spokesperson repeatedly using the word 'landlord' as a slur during question time. I wonder if he throws that around during Greens caucus meetings, because I'm sure that that would get awkward pretty quickly, considering the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> reported last year that seven Greens MPs and their spouses own 14 investment properties. So the Greens are a party of landlords pretending they're tough on landlords. Can the Greens housing spokesperson explain how that works? Can he explain how he simultaneously supports and opposes a shared equity scheme? Can he explain how he simultaneously wants to build one million new homes but opposes any homes being built in his seat? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, of course, it's not only the Greens party that is hellbent on decreasing the supply of affordable homes. The Liberal Party in my state of New South Wales has a very fine track record of driving the housing crisis. During its 12 long years in office, the state Liberal-National government sold off 7,600 public housing properties across the state. That's billions of dollars worth of social housing that could have come in handy during the housing crisis. But, other than privatising and selling off social and affordable homes, what ideas do Liberals and Nationals actually have for housing? Well, it turns out they have one idea. They want to raid your superannuation fund to pump up the housing market. The Liberals and Nationals' antisuper policy achieves two things. Firstly, it makes you poorer in retirement and, secondly, it makes housing even more unaffordable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the critics of the Liberals' housing policy have been absolutely scathing. One said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… pumping more money into the housing market by letting people access their superannuation savings … would probably lead to further increases in the cost of housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Guess who that was? The former Liberal finance minister Mathias Cormann. Another critic said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Young people need their super for retirement, not to try to take pressure off an urban housing bubble … </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was the deputy leader of the Liberal Party. Another said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… a thoroughly bad idea … It's not what the superannuation system is designed to achieve. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull. Another bloke said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I think [Malcolm Turnbull] got it right … it's not good policy and I agree with him … you don't want to fuel prices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Guess who that was? That was the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, back in 2017. So if the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, thinks it's a terrible policy and the opposition deputy leader, Sussan Ley, thinks it's a terrible policy then for what reason are we here?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You only need to look at who and what's driving this policy. It's Senator Bragg, who spent his working life before coming to this place as policy director for the Financial Services Council and the big business Business Council of Australia. The big banks and financial companies put him in the Senate, and now he's delivering them some return on investment, with constant attacks on industry super. Senator Bragg's paymasters, the banks, don't earn any interest when your savings are growing in industry super funds, but if that money is in high-interest, high-fee mortgage accounts then you're talking about even bigger profits for the big banks. That's what these policies are all about—a wealth transfer from your super funds to the profits and dividends of the big banks. You don't need to take my word for it, because that's precisely the point the opposition leader himself made in 2017. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Greens are opposing developments and the Liberals and Nationals are raiding your super, we're getting on with investing in more housing. Just today, the Minister for Housing announced 13,700 new social and affordable houses out of the Housing Australia Future Fund. That number includes 4,220 social and 9,522 affordable homes, including 1,267 homes for women and children escaping domestic violence and for older women at risk of homelessness. The Liberals and Nationals voted against that fund, and the Greens held it up in this chamber for months. Well, we're getting on with fixing the housing crisis. The Greens party should be ashamed of the politics they're playing with this.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  Tomorrow, when the full moon is apparent in the sky, the Chinese Australian community will celebrate the Mid-Autumn or Moon Festival. This is a festival that traditionally marks the end of the harvest season in the Northern Hemisphere, but it has come to take on significance not only for the gathering of crops but also for the gathering of family—giving thanks, hopefully, for a bountiful harvest season in traditional times, but more recently giving thanks for family friendships, relationships and prosperity—and to pray and offer wishes for children, for longevity and for a brighter future. I want to wish the Australian Chinese community a very happy Mid-Autumn festival. There are about 1.4 million Australians of Chinese heritage or descent, many in my own state of New South Wales and in my home town of Sydney, and I know they will be preparing moon cakes and making arrangements to eat at one another's house or dine out, to celebrate the good fortune that has seen them make their own home in Australia and to wish for good times ahead.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Chinese Australian community has made a massive contribution to our country, and it continues to do so today. Many of the students studying here are from China, many of our strongest trade links have been forged using our Chinese Australian diaspora, and of course mainland China remains our single largest trading partner and one of our major export destinations. So I want to extend my warm wishes for a happy and prosperous Mid-Autumn Festival, give my best wishes to the Chinese Australian community for the years ahead and thank them for their many contributions. Happy Moon Festival, Australia's Chinese community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  Today the Senate is considering our Help to Buy Scheme. It's an incredibly important reform to get more people to be able to achieve the great Australian dream of owning their own home, having a roof over their head and having a place to call home. Yet already this morning we've heard from both the coalition and the Greens about their plans to block thousands of Australians from doing just that—owning their own home. I think about the hardworking Australians who are struggling to build a deposit to buy themselves a home, and I wonder what kind of heartbreak they must be feeling today when they're listening to this debate and they hear the coalition and the Greens standing in the way of more Australians being able to achieve their dream of owning a home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, this government wants more people to be able to build to get into the market sooner with a smaller deposit and lower repayments, because we recognise that, without this important reform, thousands of people will continue to miss out. This scheme will help 40,000 Australian households to be able to buy a home with an equity contribution from the government. We know that Australia has a housing shortage and we need to build more homes more quickly in more parts of the country, and the Albanese government has a plan for tackling all of this. Every Australian should have safe and secure housing, and more Australians should be able to buy their own home. That is why the Albanese government is investing to help build more homes, support renters and help people buy a home sooner. It won't happen overnight, but Labor does have a plan to make it happen. Frustratingly for those desperate to get into the market, it certainly won't happen if the coalition and the Greens team up to block more housing in this parliament. Let's stop playing games, back the Help to Buy legislation in the Senate and get on with helping Australians to buy their own home.</span>

Swan currently has a Labor member who is just not delivering on the ground, as Labor has destroyed living standards of families across Swan and put every small business in Swan under pressure—a Labor member who has not stood up for Western Australia and not said one word about this Labor government's attacks on the mining industry and the agriculture industry in the WA.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's compare that to our Liberal candidate, Mic Fels, who will stand up for Swan—a mechanical engineer with a background encompassing farming, manufacturing and technology. Mic understands what it takes to deliver. He'll be another great member, just like the last great member for Swan, Steve Irons, who delivered for his local electorate. Mic is a tireless worker for his local community, and he's got a track record to prove it. What we don't need in Swan is more of the same.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  As Labor works diligently to address housing challenges across the nation, it's clear that the Greens and the LNP are much more interested in exploiting the situation for their own agendas. The Liberal and National parties, for instance, appear intent on using the housing crisis as a lever to undermine our superannuation system. Their approach is fundamentally flawed and dangerous—flawed because it fails to tackle the root causes of our housing shortage, which is the lack of supply, and dangerous because it threatens the financial security of Australians in their retirement. By pushing their plan to raid superannuation funds, they risk inflating housing prices without genuinely increasing housing stock. This would not only jeopardise retirees' ability to enjoy a dignified retirement but also force many to sell their homes and move away from their communities just to make ends meet. This is not just misguided; it's a bad idea with far-reaching negative consequences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their friends in the opposition to moving towards a better solution for housing for Australians are none other than the Australian Greens, and their proposals are equally problematic. Their housing spokesperson has made sweeping, unsubstantiated claims about there being no housing shortage, while simultaneously advocating for a housing lottery, a plan deemed by the Grattan Institute as expensive and poorly targeted. This approach by the irresponsible Greens political party reflects a lack of seriousness and an eagerness to exploit the housing issue for political gain and vote purchasing, rather than offering practical solutions. At a local level, the Greens continue to obstruct housing rezoning and to block crucial housing legislation in the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, Labor remains committed to real reform and progress. We're focused on solving the housing crisis with practical, effective measures rather than engaging in destructive and denialist policies. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Consequently, the Prime Minister's approval rating has gone from positive 27 to negative six per cent in the latest Newspoll, and down 13 per cent as preferred Prime Minister. The conversation on social media and in person simply won't move away from just how expensive it is now to live under Labor.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fixing this mess is simple: end the net zero madness and destruction of Australia's productive capacity. Net zero is increasing costs right through the supply chain and forcing up supermarket prices. One Nation would restore competition to sectors like supermarkets, which are oligopolies with foreign wealth funds manipulating prices for their own benefit and then taking those profits overseas, permanently reducing Australian wealth. Residents in some Brisbane suburbs have been hit with obscene rises in insurance of up to 10 times their previous premium. Insurance rose after Brisbane City Council produced a flood map reflecting climate change hysteria—fraud rather than actual historical flood data. Suncorp recently sold their bank because their insurance business is more profitable. How is that even possible in the free market? The Roy Morgan Research consumer confidence index has been below 85 for a record 82 successive weeks. One hundred is neutral; 85 is bad. Only one in 12 Australians expect good times ahead. Aren't governments supposed to make things better, not worse?</span>

The government wants to talk about anything except housing and the cost of living under Labor. One Nation will remain focused on offering policies to encourage enterprise and hard work to encourage and support families. It's time all Australians once again enjoyed the riches our beautiful country has to offer.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  Capital markets in Australia need to be reformed. The Australian stock exchange is rigged to suit the big end of town, insiders and foreign investors. I call on the federal government to make three changes that will level the playing field with regard to ensuring that the risk-reward paradigm is upheld. The first of these is to stop the 15 per cent accelerated capital raising rules. These rules allow company executives to issue up to 15 per cent of the company's capital in new shares at a substantial discount to their insider mates. Existing shareholders who aren't a part of the insiders club miss out on their equitable entitlement. The second is to remove the rules that say foreign investors in shares don't have to pay capital gains tax. How can the government justify given foreigners a capital gains tax break when low-income Australians have to pay tax on their wages? The third is to reintroduce the stamp duty of 1.5 per cent to remove speculators from the market. Many of these speculators are foreign owned, have access to vast sums of capital to manipulate the share price and often engage in naked short-selling to sell down before a capital raising. The funds raised by the stamp duty levy could be used to abolish payroll tax, reduce red tape and make Australian companies more competitive.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  Today I rise is to speak about one of the many daggers being sunk into Australian people during the cost-of-living crisis. Amidst this hail of blades, this particular dagger is engraved with the acronym HECS-HELP. For 35 years Australians have been living under a system that settles them with a debt that many do not pay for decades. It was a Labor government that made university free for all Australians, supplying a generation with free education, which set them up for a better future and better opportunities. Many who were born in the fifties and sixties took the government up on its offer, becoming the first in their families to attend university. From the son of a Gosnells butcher to the daughter of a Cottesloe doctor, a tertiary education was within the reach of all.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">How times have changed. Today, unless you can handle a debt of $50,000 or more for most of your working life, that door to higher education has been shut. Apprentices are being similarly burdened by the rising price of TAFE courses. To the surprise of no-one, Labor has once again clicked 'remind me later' on their 2023 national platform, where they declared that Labor believes all Australians, regardless of their background or where they live, should have the opportunity of higher education. Why is there such a disconnect between the Labor caucus and the platform they have been elected to implement? Where is the tremendous courage we witnessed during the visionary leadership of the Whitlam government? Why are we on a path towards the corporatist system we see in the United States? This government needs to act now for the coming generations of Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  Plastic production, mostly for packaging for food and consumer items, makes up 45 per cent of the petrochemical sector, which is projected to account for a third of growth in oil demand by 2030 and remain one of the biggest drivers of oil and gas exploration and extraction over the coming decades. It's no wonder multinational and gas corporations are eyeing a rapid expansion in the production of plastics to generate demand for fossil fuels in a decarbonising world. To stop the toxic tide of plastic continuing to choke our marine life and risk human health, the Albanese government must mandate in law—put their money where their mouths are—our nation's waste reduction targets.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2018, Australia set a national target to recover 70 per cent of plastic packaging by 2025 yet today only 18 per cent of our plastic packaging was recycled or composted. Australia's historic approach to waste reduction and recycling has failed. For a bit more perspective here, in the year 2000, that rate was actually 20 per cent above where it is now. It is absurd that our waste reduction targets are not legally binding given we know so much more about the dangers of plastic pollution today to the environment and to human health. The fact the government is still kicking the can down the road is a disgrace.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Big producers of plastic packaging have been operating with impunity, free from any responsibility, penalty or regulation. Voluntary approaches and self-regulation to waste reduction don't work. It's that simple. Big companies will never care about the planet as much as their profits, which means mandating in law waste reduction targets is the only way to get them to take the matter seriously.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  The introduction of new misinformation and disinformation legislation is just a renewed attack on freedom of speech in Australia. Labor has never understood freedom of speech or how it works, and people always fear what they don't understand. That's why Labor wants to shut down freedom of speech. That's why Labor wants to give itself the power to decide what is misinformation and disinformation and use this power to silence honest debate and honest criticism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is appalled at the very notion that Australians still have the right to say things that Labor doesn't agree with. Labor doesn't trust the Australian people to sort out truth from fiction for themselves. With this bill, Labor shows its contempt for the intelligence of the Australian people. Labor will use this power to silence dissent. If you speak the truth that gender ideology is contrived nonsense, that climate change is a scam or that COVID-19 vaccines are harmful, Labor will have the power to silence you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is all the evidence this country needs to have a good hard look at enshrining the right to free speech in the Constitution. One Nation tried to move an inquiry to kickstart this process. Labor opposed it, along with those other staunch opponents of free speech in Australia—the Greens. When are Australians going to wake up and understand these parties for what they are? They despise democracy and the principles which underpin its foundations. There is no democracy in Australia without freedom of speech, its most important principle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation will oppose this legislation. We will always fight to protect true freedom of speech in our continual efforts to defend Australian democracy, and I want the people to fully understand this: they have their rights. They have a right to have an opinion and everyone has the right to actually have a say. Freedom of speech needs to be protected, and that's what we will fight for.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  Two weeks ago, I had the pleasure of doorknocking in Lindisfarne on Hobart's eastern shore with the Tasmania Liberal candidate for Franklin, Josh Garvin. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to all of the residents of Lindisfarne who we spoke to that day and who shared their thoughts with myself and Josh. There was no surprise. The feedback on the doors was that the cost-of-living crisis is hitting Tasmanians hard.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One issue really stood out for us, and that was the alarming rise in food prices, which we know is having a real impact on household budgets. Under this Labor government, prices have increased by more than 10 per cent including for our most basic needs. Food is up by 11 per cent, health is up by 11 per cent, electricity has increased by 22 per cent and education has increased by 11 per cent. The list goes on and on. These increases are straining household budgets and families are forced to rethink their grocery list and their meal plans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While many whom we spoke to appreciated the energy bill relief offered by the government, it is important to recognise this assistance is merely a one-off payment. It provides only temporary relief and it fails to address the root of the issue here. People are rightfully asking: what is the Albanese Labor government doing to provide a lasting solution to the inflation crisis that we find ourselves in? We have to remember that this year every major advanced economy has seen inflation decline except for Australia. Yes, you heard that right—except for Australia. The Labor government attributes our domestic cost-of-living issues to global factors, yet we see other countries making progress while Australia stalls. It is clear that Australians, particularly Tasmanians, are paying the price for Labor's economic mismanagement, and we simply cannot afford another three years of this sort of thing. Frankly, Tasmanians deserve better.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  If you're a fan of frozen peas and you buy a brand that has been processed at Simplot's Devonport plant, you have probably eaten a pea grown in Tasmania. Simplot processes lots of vegetables picked fresh on Tasmanian farms and snap frozen for the best flavour and nutrients. You might know frozen veggie brands Birds Eye and Edgell, but Tassie peas are in the supermarkets' private label brands—Four Farms and Bell Farms—too. If you wander along the freezer aisle and look at all the different packets, I can tell you there is a lot of Tasmania produce in there. But that might not be the case for long. The Four Farms and Bell Farms brands sell for about a half the price of the supermarkets' other home brand pea products because they are 'phantom' peas. 'Phantom' comes from Tasmania's own retail expert Dr Louise Grimmer, who uses it to describe brands where it is not clear they are actually owned by the supermarkets. These phantom peas have become very popular during the cost-of-living crisis because shoppers know the produce is good and it costs less.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But another crisis is looming, and this one bites the farmers. Coles has slashed its pea contract with Tasmanian growers. Instead of buying 100 per cent local for its own brands, Coles is looking to source peas from outside Tasmania—actually, outside Australia altogether. So the company that made $1.1 billion in profit last year feels the need to save a bit of money by shafting growers. Tasmanian pea growers are now working out which other crops they should grow to make up the shortfall. It probably impacts Simplot too because Simplot is the only frozen pea producer in Australia. Thankfully, TasFarmers has a grower negotiating committee that works with Simplot to set price and crop area for all producers, based on demand. But, really, what we're talking about here is just another way the supermarkets are ripping us off. And I bet you the kids in the gallery don't like peas!</span>

How many times do we have to come to this place and hear this nonsense from the Greens—this economic nonsense that rent controls, rent caps or rent ceilings are a solution to Australia's housing problem? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past I've quoted from my book <span style="font-style:italic;">Basic Economics</span> by Thomas Sowell. Rent controls didn't work in Australia after World War II in Melbourne. They didn't work in Egypt. They didn't work in the United States. They haven't worked in England and Wales. They haven't worked in Canada or the United States. Nowhere where they've been tried have rent controls actually worked. They always make the problem worse. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I want to refer to another study on rent controls in Argentina, and I thank my friend Martin for forwarding this to me. Again, these mechanisms have been tried. What happened in Argentina in 2019 when they introduced rent controls—the rent controls the extreme Greens want Australia to have? Forty-five per cent of landlords stopped renting. Average rents soared. They went up from 18,000 pesos a month at the end of 2019 to 334,000 pesos today. Landlords stopped paying for maintenance on their properties. What happened when rent controls were removed in Argentina just recently? It led to an increase in supply of approximately 45 per cent, and rents actually fell between 20 and 30 per cent following the removal of rent control. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  The Senate has a huge opportunity today. We could pass Labor's Help to Buy Bill and make housing more accessible and affordable for tens of thousands of Australian families. This is a policy with widespread support. It's supported by the Grattan Institute, the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute, the Master Builders Association, the Housing Industry Association and National Shelter. It has been supported by former Liberal prime ministers John Howard, Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison; Tasmanian Liberal Premier Jeremy Rockliff; the Queensland LNP leader; former premier Dominic Perrottet and Treasurer Matt Kean; and former Western Australian coalition leader Mia Davies. I know the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, loves saying no to everyone and everything, but he may be setting a record here for the most people in his own party he's saying no to in one go.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Help to Buy is also supported by the policy platform the Greens took to the last election. The Greens political platform said: 'The Greens will establish a shared equity ownership scheme to help people currently locked out of the market to own their first home.' What a great idea! Now you've got an opportunity to stick to your word and vote for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are doing it really tough with the housing crisis. They expect people in this chamber to do something about it. They are sick and tired of the politicking on housing. They just want solutions. They want them now. Sadly, like toxic blue-green algae, the Liberals and Greens are poisoning our housing market.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  What we're seeing today in this chamber again is another impasse when it comes to housing in this country. Let's be very clear. It is my generation of Australians and those younger than us who feel locked out of the housing market and let down by leaders in this chamber and across the aisle when it comes to housing policy, and is it any wonder? If they tune into the Senate today they would see another impasse here, where the government has brought a policy to do something about housing and those opposite want to contain their aspiration to own a house. Those opposite want young Australians to choose between superannuation and a secure retirement and owning a home. Well, Labor believes young Australians deserve to have both. We do not believe that young Australians should have to choose between homeownership and superannuation. Their parents didn't have to make that choice. Their grandparents didn't have to make that choice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite don't care about solutions here. They care about a political outcome which lets young people down. They are limiting their aspirations, and that is an outrageous breach of a social contract with those young Australians. And the Greens aren't any better. They're more interested in social media engagement than social outcomes and social change. They're more interested in securing the clicks of young people than securing the future of young people. There is an opportunity to do something on housing today. You can come in here and say no and draft your memes, or we can do something about it.</span>

As reflected in the national accounts, we have seen soft growth. In fact, it has been the decision of this government to not cut spending like those opposite want to do—$315 billion worth of cuts they have said they will implement in government—that has ensured that our economy keeps growing. It's actually those opposite that, if they were able to implement the policies that they have outlined to the electorate, want to see a recession in this country. We don't. That is why we have been making those sensible investments to help people with the cost of living whilst getting the budget in better shape by ensuring that we have had two surpluses. Those opposite weren't able to deliver one surplus in the decade that they were in government. They got the mugs printed, didn't they? That would get the Leader of the Opposition to his feet.</span>

The minister was asked a very narrowly worded question about how many quarters Australia has been in a per capita recession and, thus far, she has not mentioned 'recession', 'per capita' or even really 'economic growth'.

Those opposite are the only people in the country that would be sitting there waiting for the economic data to come out and wishing it to be worse than it actually is. Those opposite shattered on the day that interest rates held. They were shattered that that happened.

We get that inflation remains a big challenge in our economy, which is why we are so pleased that it has moderated, almost halved, from when we inherited an inflation challenge that was escalating in this country, not moderating. So we are pleased about that. But we get that people are doing it tough, which is why we put in place those sensible cost-of-living measures to help, like Commonwealth rent assistance, something that those opposite would cut, according to the shadow finance minister. Also, energy bill rebates are something they would cut. They see it as wasteful spending. All of those are investments that we have made to help people through this difficult time. We accept it is difficult. We would all like inflation to return to band sooner, but our plan is working and we are supporting people through this difficult time.</span>

We are pleased that wages have got moving again under our economic plan—something you wanted to cut. We are pleased that almost a million jobs have been created in the first term of an Albanese government—more people in work, more people earning more and keeping more of what they earn. That is important, and we are seeing economic growth continue in this country, when other, like-minded economies have seen quarters of negative growth, which is not something we have seen here. We've got a strong labour market. We're seeing inflation moderate. We're seeing wages get moving again. And we acknowledge that it is tough—hence our cost-of-living measures, which you have opposed, almost exclusively. Every single one of them would have been worse off had you been in charge, under your economic plan.</span>

Labor senators, the Labor government and the Labor Party want every Australian to have safe and secure housing, and we want more Australians to be able to buy their own homes. We want to build; you want to block. That's the difference between us and the coalition-Greens coalition. These senators want to build houses; you want to block houses from being built.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are investing to help build more homes, support renters and help people buy a home sooner. We have set an ambitious goal of building 1.2 million homes by the end of the decade. We've kickstarted construction by cutting red tape. We're bringing forward the construction of new housing by working with states to build roads and infrastructure and free up land for housing—training more tradies, funding more apprenticeships and growing the workforce. We've increased rent assistance; we've helped tens of thousands of Australians get into the market with a deposit of five per cent or less and no mortgage insurance; and we are making the biggest investment in social and affordable housing in more than a decade.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to do more, and we want to deliver more homes for more Australians around the country. But do you know what is stopping us? It is the Greens and the coalition teaming up, once again, to block more housing. That's what they've been doing for months and months, and here we go again. We see the coalition between the Greens and the LNP blocking Labor's plan for more affordable rental housing and blocking Labor's plan to help tens of thousands of people get into the market with a smaller deposit. Those on this side of the chamber want to build. All you across the chamber want to do is block. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The first round of our Housing Australia Future Fund and National Housing Accord programs will deliver more than 4,200 social and 9,522 affordable homes, including 1,300 for women and children escaping family violence and women at risk of homelessness. This round will unlock about $9.2 billion in investment in social and affordable housing across the Commonwealth, state and territory governments and the private and community housing sectors—the biggest investment in social and affordable housing in more than a decade. In our first term, we are providing and supporting more social and affordable housing than those opposite did in their entire decade in office. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Help to Buy scheme will support 40,000 low- and middle-income Australians to buy their own homes. That's what the Liberals and the Greens are working together to block, and, by doing this, they are playing with the futures of tens of thousands of Australians who are on low or middle incomes. The questions I want to ask are: When did it become part of Liberal values to stand against homeownership? When did it become a Greens value to work with Peter Dutton to prevent homeownership? The reality is that we are seeing this political convenience between the coalition and the Greens—supposedly at opposite ends of the spectrum but working together to prevent houses being built. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The decisions we have taken in every single budget to implement policies which actually put downward pressure on inflation, such as our investments in early education and care, our investments in rent, and our energy bill rebates, have all—and this comes from the ABS—put downward pressure on inflation.

So we have made decisions, based on what is in the interests of households around this country—of families sitting around, trying to make ends meet.

That is not unusual.

We are in a rental and housing crisis, but, instead of negotiating with the Greens to freeze and cap rents and end billions of dollars in tax handouts to wealthy property developers, investors and speculators that are preventing people buying their first home, the government is pulling a political stunt by trying to force its housing bill on for a vote today. Minister, given your bill can only, at best, help 0.2 per cent of renters while pushing up house prices for everyone else, why won't you join with the Greens to end negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts that are stopping renters from buying a home?</span>

How does a party that professes to be progressive and to stand up for those who are in trouble, those who are doing it tough, work with Peter Dutton to stop a Labor government building more houses? That is the real question. What is it about your political opportunism that you would be prepared to work with Peter Dutton—</span>

We're the ones that care about people. We're the ones that actually care.' But they come in here with the most cynical of political acts in teaming up with Mr Dutton, who is not known for his support for social housing, who is not known for his support for affordable housing and who is not known for his support for anything positive for the Australian people. You empower him, and then you come in here and tell us, 'You're not doing what we want, so we're going to vote no.' Give us all a break—really! I think it is patently self-evident to everybody in this chamber—the cynical political tactics that the Greens are engaging in. What you should do is come in and vote for the bill, and then people will take you seriously when it comes to housing.</span>

                  </a>  Senator Faruqi, who is part of a party that has opposed, blocked, voted against and campaigned against Labor's policies on housing, now comes in here complaining about delays. Just so everybody is really clear that this is what they are doing, they have consistently voted against the government's policies to increase homeownership. They've consistently voted against the government's policies to put roofs over the heads of Australians. They voted with Mr Dutton to delay the Housing Australia Future Fund's 30,000 new social and affordable housing. Can you believe that? The Greens political party voted against social and affordable housing. It only has to be said for people to see how extraordinary it is. And, of course, we know that, across the country, the Greens are blocking housing developments. I'm very happy to talk about some of those— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's because they don't have a leg to stand on. Minister, the majority of the homes that have been allocated funding so far from the HAFF are so-called affordable homes. However, given that their rents are set at 75 per cent of severely unaffordable market rents, how many of these homes will be genuinely affordable to low-income renters? </span>

That really does demonstrate the political marriage which is on display—a marriage of political convenience, which is all about blocking. What I would say is this: Senator Faruqi, we have announced today 13,700 social and affordable homes for the first round of the Housing Australia Future Fund. This is the biggest one-off delivery of social housing in over a decade. It will provide, amongst other things, 1,200 homes for women and children escaping domestic violence and older women at risk of homelessness. We would have been able to announce this sooner and we would have been able to progress these projects sooner if you had not worked with Mr Dutton to delay the HAFF. So please remember that the next time you stand up and talk about social housing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Just as the Albanese Labor government have delivered cost-of-living relief as part of every federal budget, we've also made significant commitments to housing because we know how important it is in providing stability and economic security for all Australians. The Albanese Labor government is building more homes more quickly in every part of the country. Can the minister please outline the housing policies we have already delivered and other commitments that have been budgeted for? How will these policies make homeownership a reality for more Australians?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Smith has outlined, we have made contributions to addressing the housing challenge in every single budget since we came to government. Let's not forget the responsibility of those opposite for some of the challenges in the housing market at the moment. After a decade of neglect—where I don't think they even had a housing minister for quite a long period of time, let alone anyone in cabinet representing it. Their single housing policy was one of Senator Bragg's favourites; I think it was 'raid your super'. His answer to every challenge across Australia at the moment is 'raid your super'. Let it rip! Let's just raid the super!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the government have addressed it in every single budget. In our first budget, we committed to the Housing Australia Future Fund, which unfortunately was delayed in this chamber for a long period of time. We invested in Help to Buy, we put in a very significant package for Indigenous housing in the Northern Territory and, of course, we had a measure which supported pensioners looking to downsize—to deal with some of the financial impact of that. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the second budget, we increased Commonwealth rent assistance, something that those opposite would chop. We committed another $100 million for remote housing in the Northern Territory. We've encouraged investment through measures for build-to-rent, and we boosted homelessness funding by $67.5 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the third budget, our third opportunity to build on that program—that ambitious program of housing—we put more money into the Housing Support Program. We got a national agreement on social housing and homelessness. We funded new places in TAFE for construction. We got concessional finance for community housing providers and further investments in rent assistance and remote housing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We have been trying to make sure that we have a measure that covers a whole range of areas on the housing scale, and one of them is the pressure that women, often with accompanying children, have when leaving violent relationships. And so, of the housing that the Prime Minister announced today, over 1,200 homes will be for women and children escaping domestic violence and for older women at risk of homelessness. We know that's another area where women—often when marriages break down and children have left home, and there are not a lot of financial assets—find themselves in that precarious position. This government's policies are aiming to support all of those women who find themselves in that position, and this Senate should do its job and support positive housing policies that will make a difference not only for this generation but for future generations. </span>

The biggest challenge to housing in this country is the blockers. They are. They're the blockers in this chamber. When we moved to have a shared-equity scheme—the Greens also had a shared-equity scheme in the last election. They wanted a shared-equity scheme. We're trying to deliver that, and they are opposed to it. The Liberals—the coalition—have said they'll oppose the HAFF. They've said they'll look to cut back on things like Commonwealth Rent Assistance and all of these important measures that go to building our housing agenda, making sure we've got enough housing and making sure we're supporting people who can't afford it into more affordable housing. We're making sure the homelessness and social housing sector also have opportunities to build their stock so that they can support people into those forms of housing as well. But the blockers in this chamber are the biggest challenges we've got. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Minister, during evening and morning peak hours, electricity generation from industrial solar and wind averages just 10 per cent of rated capacity, because solar doesn't work in the dark, and wind goes quiet at night. Big batteries can transfer electricity from daytime to the evening peak. Minister, how much battery capacity is your government planning to build to maintain electricity supply between sunset and sunrise?</span>

The senator is right to point to the fact that Australia's electricity system is changing. We have, as I think most senators understand, a fleet of ageing coal-fired power stations that require replacement. I can tell you they are not getting any more reliable. In fact, over the last year, I don't think there's been a day when we haven't had a circumstance where at least one of the coal-fired power generators in the national electricity market has been offline for one kind of maintenance or another. Of course, this arises because we went through nearly a decade when the coalition, while in government, did not land an energy policy. They had 22 policies; none of them landed.

And that is what the Capacity Investment Scheme has been designed to do. We have just been through a round of the Capacity Investment Scheme where we received very significant commitments to underwriting very significant battery capacity. We do understand the significance of this technology. What the experts tell us is that the most cost-effective way to establish a national energy market that can meet the energy requirements of Australian homes and businesses is a combination of wind, of solar, of batteries and of gas, and that is the policy setting that we— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Different states have different arrangements in terms of the ownership and investment in generation, and so the investment that will take place will look different depending on the ownership arrangements that are in place across the national electricity market. However, we understand that there is a measure of support required from the Commonwealth government, and it is why we have put in place the Capacity Investment Scheme, which aims to provide support for those who are seeking to invest in new capacity, whether it is in batteries or other forms of generation in the national electricity market.</span>

Minister, AEMO is working off a figure of 60 gigawatt hours of storage at around $1 billion an hour, which is $60 billion. How much will electricity prices and supermarket prices rise as a result of having to spend that staggering amount of money?</span>

The Capacity Investment Scheme will deliver 32 gigawatts of renewable and clean dispatchable capacity to fill emerging reliability gaps. The truth is that will put downward pressure on prices, because one of the consequences of the failed policies of those opposite is that we do have capacity capabilities that need to be filled because energy capacity is leaving the market and it has not been replaced. We are taking steps necessary to replace it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In July of this year Prime Minister Albanese pretended to act surprised when revelations about the CFMEU's links with criminal activity were unearthed. Today we saw a whistleblower, Andrew Quirk, confirm that the Prime Minister knew about the links between your donors in the CFMEU and bikie gangs and criminal syndicates more than 10 years ago. The whistleblower personally told the now Prime Minister of his concerns. Can the minister please confirm that Mr Albanese has been well aware of the CFMEU's link with criminal activity, corruption, bullying, harassment and standover tactics for at least 10 years.</span>

                  </a>  What I would say to Senator Cash is perhaps if your government had been less focused on playing politics on a royal commission which was all about attacking the Labor Party and the trade union movement, maybe if you'd paid more attention to what was already public, you might have actually had the courage to do what the Prime Minister has done. That is to take the strongest action that could be taken against organised crime, violence and thuggery in the trade union movement, and we do so not because we are anti union; we are pro union.</span>

Prime Minister Albanese made big promises about transparency and accountability before coming into government, but we have been waiting over two years and, despite what Labor keeps telling the media, we are yet to see any electoral reform legislation from this government. The Greens have been calling for changes to our donation laws for decades, and in this parliament Labor has a crossbench ready to progress genuine electoral reform. Minister, will you keep your election commitment to improve our democracy, or will you instead stitch up a deal with the LNP to benefit the flagging two-party system?</span>

You're correct. The Prime Minister did make undertakings to improve transparency and accountability in our electoral system. As you would be aware, a process was gone through in the relevant committee to examine a variety of proposals with respect to electoral reforms, and they did include aspects to deal with accountability and transparency and also regulating the amount of money that can be spent on the Australian electoral system.</span>

Safe and affordable housing is central to the security and dignity of Australians, but Australia doesn't have enough homes, and hasn't for a long time. We have an ambitious national goal of building 1.2 million homes by the end of the decade, but how is the Albanese Labor government working to take housing pressure off Australians by building more homes more quickly?</span>

I know she has a great interest in housing and homelessness issues in the great state of Victoria. Of course, today the government has announced investment in more than 13,700 new social and affordable homes across Australia. It shows that the Commonwealth is back in the game of directly supporting new housing rights right across the country. After a decade of the coalition failing Australians at the Commonwealth level, this is the biggest investment in social and affordable housing in over a decade. We want more homes because that will reduce long-term rental queues across the country and make renting more affordable for everyone. We know the importance of having a roof over your head. Our Prime Minister is a testament to that story. His entire life was changed by his ability to access secure housing.</span>

The federal government, through the Help to Buy scheme, is ensuring that people on lower and middle incomes can come up with that deposit sooner and get their foot in the door of their own place sooner. These are the early childhood educators, the cleaners, the paramedics, the carers—everyone who we rely on on a daily basis. This is about getting them into their own home. So I say to the coalition and the Greens: let's get this done. Let's help 40,000 lower- and middle-income Australians get on the ladder. Let's do it right now.</span>

Geoffrey Watson SC's interim report investigating unlawful behaviour into the CFMEU, released this morning, has confirmed the recent revelations of corruption, criminality, violence and intimidation on CFMEU worksites. Australian taxpayers and homebuyers are paying more for infrastructure and apartments as a result of the CFMEU's behaviour. The investigation found CFMEU officials had switched employment from the union to paid employment with employers and 'remained on the same sites with more or less the same authority'. If the CFMEU management has lost control of the union, why does the CFMEU boss, who opposed the administration, still have his job at the union?</span>

I would also make the point that we have asked the Fair Work Ombudsman to undertake a targeted review of all enterprise agreements made by the Victorian branch of the construction division of the CFMEU that apply to big build projects. We have requested the AFP investigate recent allegations and work cooperatively with state police to investigate and prosecute any criminal breaches, and we will use procurement powers to ensure that enterprise agreements on government funded projects are genuine and that workplaces are free from coercion and intimidation.</span>

It was the ABCC which was in place during the period that the sorts of issues that you're referring to continued to worsen, as Senator Cash's question today demonstrates. What I would say is that the administrator has sacked a dozen people. We've seen other places where action has been taken. I've outlined certain funding arrangements which we are putting in place, and we will continue to do what this Prime Minister has been very clear about, which is that we will stand up against corruption, intimidation and organised crime inside the labour movement.</span>

The senator is providing some real representation for people in regional Australia. We know that homeownership has long been a dream for many Australians, but for many right now it is becoming harder, especially after a decade of neglect by the coalition. When we came to office, new home builds were at their lowest level in nearly a decade, and Australians are still paying the price for this absence of action under the coalition. It means that Australians are facing immense stress about where they're going to live and what they can afford to pay. And what it means particularly for regional communities is that people are being priced out of their home towns, and skilled workers, who could be filling skills shortages, are unable to move to the regions, because there is nowhere for them to live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this problem began under the coalition government, and under the Albanese Labor government things are beginning to change. Today's Housing Australia Future Fund announcement will see 3,000 social and affordable homes built outside of Australia's capital cities. It's part of the largest investment in social and affordable housing in a decade, and we're helping regional Australians whether they're renting or buying. We've supported more than 18,000 regional Australians to buy their own homes, including 13,000 who have accessed the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee. We've made the biggest increases to rent assistance in more than 30 years, which is providing relief to more than one million households, and we're strengthening renters' rights through what we're calling a better deal for renters. After a decade of inaction by the coalition, our government is getting building moving again, especially for people living in our regions.</span>

There have been many questions on housing that have not gone specifically to it during question time; however, the question just asked does specifically go to it and goes to that scheme at a time when it is before the chamber on this very day. So, whilst this standing order might be quite narrowly interpreted, I believe it is definitely within the grounds for you to interpret this question as being out of order. </span>

What have they done to help families in places like Cairns, Nowra, the Hunter and all those other parts of regional Australia? They've done absolutely nothing. They have voted against our Housing Australia Future Fund, they've voted against rent assistance and now they're trying to prevent people buying— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Of course, the Greens party, we know, are more interested in grandstanding than delivering real change, more interested in social media than social housing and more interested in clicks on social media than bricks on slabs. They've been campaigning against new housing developments in Brisbane, and now they're campaigning against housing legislation down here in Canberra. Again, we see the Greens in league with Peter Dutton and the coalition to block young renters from buying their own home.</span>

And every time the Greens party joins with the coalition to attack and undermine Labor, they block housing and they help Peter Dutton. That is what you are about: blocking housing, making life harder for young people and helping the people over there.</span>

The motion you've just moved is usually in response to an explanation. I'm advised that you did not give my office notice of this, as is the usual practice. I have asked you for the courtesy of responding to you and providing an explanation before you then proceed to the next stage. If you don't wish to provide that courtesy, so be it, but that is a courtesy that has been extended by people at that end of the chamber and by the opposition to governments regularly. I've indicated to you that I will provide an explanation as quickly as I can. If you wish to move that motion, so be it, but it is frankly a lack of courtesy to the chamber and usual practice.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Senate estimates, the 2024-25 budget estimates, were my first experience of estimates as a senator. I thought it would be an excellent opportunity to get to the bottom of some of the really integral questions raised by stakeholders across a range of issues: cheaper child care, fee increases, community childcare fund, preschool reform agreements, childcare fees, inclusion support programs, childcare refugee and asylum seeker issues, issues really important in my local community of Macnamara around the closure of a post office without adequate information being provided, Indooroopilly roundabout project funding discrepancies—a huge range of issues that stakeholders and the public are expecting answers to and thought that they would have received by now.</span>

I look forward to seeing the information being provided by the relevant portfolio holders and ministerial departments. This information is really important, and we need to have adequate lead time leading into the next round of estimates to be able to interrogate this information further and provide what I think is information that is in the public interest that we have a right to expect in a timely fashion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  I move:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of answers given by ministers to all questions without notice asked today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that concern me the most is the ongoing challenges in relation to the cost-of-living crisis in our country and the ongoing challenges that everyday Australians have in relation to inflation, which is really problematic. Senator Birmingham asked the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Gallagher, a really important question: for how many quarters has Australia been in a per capita recession? That is a very simple question to answer. It takes about five or 10 seconds, maximum. But for two minutes we heard a narrative around what was inherited by this government. We heard a narrative around a scare campaign that the government is running in relation to what the opposition may or may not do when they are next in government. So, instead of actually answering the question and talking about what this government is doing to solve these problems, they keep pointing back to the opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The answer to the question is six—six quarters of per capita recession. It's a pretty basic answer, a standard answer, a one-digit answer to the question Senator Birmingham asked. It's curious to me that Senator Gallagher didn't want to answer the question. It would have been simpler to just answer it and then go on to the next question. But I think it's reflective of the problem we have in this government in that there is, for whatever reason, an inability to answer or a decision actually not to answer questions that are asked, which further compounds the problems we have, for two reasons: (1) if you won't acknowledge or address that you have a problem, you can't fix it; and (2) you then have a complete loss of confidence from the Australian public in your ability to fix any of the problems we currently have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Birmingham asked more questions in relation to that, and again Senator Gallagher didn't answer. She spoke about sensible investments, and I need to point to the energy rebate of $75 a quarter. I don't think that is a sensible investment. I don't think it is sensible that in a cost-of-living crisis every household in this country gets a $75-a-quarter discount on its bill. People for whom $75 doesn't matter at all get a rebate, and then we have families where $75 is really important and something that helps them make ends meet. So it's not, in my view, a sensible investment to give $75 a quarter to super-wealthy people who don't need it. I was glad, though, to hear Senator Gallagher confirm that we are in difficult times and that we do have an inflation challenge. I think that's a really important acknowledgement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hume also asked some questions in relation to the government's spending. Again, Senator Gallagher spoke about investments contributing to the continuing growth of the economy. Well, in fact it's not growing. We have had six quarters of per capita recession. Senator Gallagher acknowledged that population growth is contributing to what she called growth of the economy. So the reason we didn't have the recession that we didn't actually speak of is record migration levels. We are in fact experiencing six quarters of per capita recession in our country. It is something this government doesn't want to acknowledge. If they don't acknowledge it, if they don't speak of it, they can't plan to fix it, and if they don't plan to fix it then they won't fix it at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last piece I want to speak about is around Senator Cash's questions to Senator Wong in relation to the CFMEU. This is really disturbing, particularly in relation to how long our Prime Minister knew about the issues that were afoot at the CFMEU. Whilst there may be a narrative about what was publicly disclosed and what wasn't, it's important to understand that during this period this government continued to take donations from the CFMEU—over $6 million worth of donations. If you believe that there is something wrong and that funds are potentially the proceeds of crime, you should not be taking them. But this Prime Minister continued to take those funds, and there are some serious questions we need to ask. When did the Prime Minister know? Why did he keep taking the money, and did anybody encourage him to stop taking the money?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator URQUHART</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  Senator Gallagher, in her answers, talked about making sensible investments, and part of those sensible investments that she spoke about was to help people with the cost of living. But, while we've been making those investments to help people with the cost of living, we've been getting the budget in better shape, and Senator Gallagher also talked about that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Gallagher talked about how we have ensured that we've had a surplus. In fact, she outlined very clearly that, during the period of time that we've been in government, we've had two surpluses and that those opposite weren't able to have one surplus in the decade that they were in government. She also talked about how strong population growth and sensible government investments have ensured that our economy keeps on growing. It's certainly strong population growth and sensible government investment that have made sure that our economy keeps growing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The primary focus of the Albanese government is to ease the cost-of-living pressures for Australians, but, at the same time, we are fighting inflation in our economy. We recognise that people are under the pump, and we're doing something about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that Senator Kovacic talked about the energy rebate and how she felt that the manner in which it had been delivered wasn't sensible. I'm not sure how many constituents the senator has spoken to out there since that energy relief has come through, but I know a number of people have come and talked to me when I'm out and about in the community, have rung the office and have come into the office to thank the Labor government for that initiative, which has really helped them in terms of their cost of living. I guess there are two lots of people that we're talking about here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're already rolling out tax cuts for every taxpayer and energy rebates, as we've spoken about, for every household, and there will be more that will continue to be rolled out over the months. We're making rents cheaper for nearly one million households. We're finalising the rollout of 60-day dispensing for additional medicines. We've already had one lot of 60-day dispensing, with a lot of opposition and carrying on from those over on that side, but, I'll tell you what, the pharmacies are doing okay. They're doing really well, and the constituents who are on the receiving end of those savings from that 60-day dispensing are thanking us for that initiative. They are thanking us because we are helping them with the cost of living and the costs of their medicines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're indexing payments for people on JobSeeker, the age pension, the disability support pension, the carer payment and the parenting payment, as well as the Commonwealth rent assistance. But we're doing that in a responsible way that helps fight the fight against inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that those on the other side have opposed all of this. They opposed the 60-day dispensing. They opposed the energy rebate. Whatever we put up, they're opposing it. They're still opposing it. The housing bills that we've got currently on the table to get through this place so that people can get assistance to purchase a house, they are opposing. They are definitely the 'no-alition'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They say that they will cut $315 billion from the budget, and that includes all of that cost-of-living relief that I talked about. It beggars belief that, at a time when so many Australians are under pressure, they want to take away this help. That is their mantra. We've brought in lots of initiatives that will help people with the cost of living and help them meet daily living expenses. And what are those opposite going to do? They're going to take it all away—and other things as well—because they're going to cut $315 billion from the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are also going to lower wages. It's in their DNA. We know that; they've said that for a very long time. They would pull the rug out from under people at this very important time. It's the worst possible time that people could have their cost of living relief attacked by those opposite. Their cuts would leave the economy in a critical condition. That's what the facts are. They don't want to fight inflation; they want to fight an ideological battle against the Australian people, when we are working hard to cut the cost of living and help people save.</span>

We are seeing almost the embodiment of that principle across the other side of the chamber. The answer to these six consecutive, I think, quarters of recession in this country is not to just keep blaming those before you or getting out the big novelty cheque and running it around. That's just not the way this is done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm old enough to remember what the product of these types of policies, this so-called progressive agenda, was. I don't know why it's always called 'progressive'. You wouldn't want to progress too far, if this is where we're going; we'll progress right off a cliff if we continue to take this path. But I can remember what this was like. I had a very early introduction to this, as a young man, an adolescent, going to Victoria in the early nineties and seeing the product of a very socialist Victorian government, on top of the always socialist Labor government, here, federally. Seeing what that did to the state of Victoria—in particular, to the city of Melbourne—was a very early lesson for me as a young person. So, when I come into this place and hear these excuses and these harebrained political schemes, it's often something that I look back on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is, of course, a government whose Prime Minister made a solemn promise to the Australian people that Australians would be better off. Well, that is extraordinary. We've had, I think, something like nine quarters since the federal election in May 2022. Six of them have been in recession; I think six out of nine have been in recession. That doesn't sound like a country that, ultimately, is better off, frankly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you drill down into the statistics on this, it becomes even more alarming. The price of gas in this country is up 33 per cent. The price of electricity is up 14 per cent. The rental prices in this country are now up 16 per cent across the country. On healthcare costs, we hear all the time about how that side of the chamber is doing it for the man on the street, but in fact these are the sorts of things which actually hurt—an 11 per cent rise in healthcare costs. Education is up 11 per cent. Food is up 12 per cent. And insurance, the sleeper—this is the one that gets business, of course, all the time—is up 17 per cent since this government came to power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are actually some of the worst national account figures since the early nineties—the slowest GDP growth, in fact, since the early nineties. Australians ultimately are experiencing a decline in their living standards of something like 8.7 per cent in real disposable income in per capita terms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can hear about how people walk into the offices of those opposite, thanking them for giving them their money back in terms of some offset. But what people really want is a government with a plan. This government doesn't have a plan. It's written on a piece of paper. It's like <span style="font-style:italic;">Run</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Spot, Run</span>. It's not a plan; it's just a whole lot of words jumbled together with the word 'progressive' tacked onto them. It's not going to take us out of this. This is a product of Australians putting their trust in this government that has breached that trust.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even the Salvation Army now are talking about the catastrophe. There was a story that they recently put up on their website about how 40 per cent of Aussie households have struggled to afford household basics in the last few months, and over half of Australians now say that they won't be able to pay an essential bill over the next few months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the Australia that this Labor government has created. This is the Australia that it has given us, on top of ambit promises—simple-word statements like 'a future made in Australia'. Well, what does that look like? What's this country going to look like if we go through another three or four years of this? It's going to look like Venezuela. It might even look like Somalia. Who knows? We are constantly finding out things we didn't want to know about how government can be run, and that masterclass is being put on by those opposite.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="257613" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GHOSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:30</span>):  The coalition try to score political points here today over slow or soft growth in the Australian economy, but one of the problems that they face, and one of the problems that sit at the heart of their lack of economic credibility, is that they are against one of the measures that are driving up economic growth in our economy at the moment, and that is public spending. The coalition have indicated that there is $315 billion in public spending, mainly cost-of-living measures and investments in economic infrastructure, that the coalition would not have committed to, and they have indicated that they will take hatchets to parts of this spending. Well, that's going to have a negative impact on economic growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second criticism that was levelled heavily today is that this is a government that doesn't have a plan. Well, that's simply inaccurate. The coalition members are not listening. There are three aspects of the government's plan to support economic growth that I want to talk about today. The first is competition reform, the second is investment in skills and training in Australia and the third is our paid parental leave reforms. But the reality is that economic reforms and policies that support growth and support improvements in productivity in our economy take time to implement. You put in place the reforms, and the dividends of those reforms come a bit later on. That's essentially why the government is making the investments that it's doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first is in relation to competition reform. Assistant Minister Andrew Leigh recently released a consultation paper on revitalising national competition policy. The original national competition policy, a child of Paul Keating and an economically reformist Labor government, was a driver of economic growth and proactivity in Australia. Competition drives firms to innovate and to make positive changes internally. It can also incentivise the flow of resources to more productive outputs. Competition is a good thing in our economy, and the original National Competition Policy aided economic growth in the 1990s. In a report published in 2005, the Productivity Commission estimated that the gains from the policy reforms that flowed from the National Competition Policy led to a permanent increase of 2.5 per cent in Australia's GDP. As Dr Leigh recently observed, in contemporary terms that lift equated to around $50 billion a year, or $5,000 per household. By revitalising national competition policy, the government is putting in place measures that will improve productivity in Australia over time and will ultimately be drivers of economic growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second aspect of those investments is investment in Australia's human capital through education and training. That goes back as far as early childhood education, the proper and equitable funding of Australia's public schools and investments in vocational education and training, including fee-free TAFE programs. This government has invested $500 million to create 320,000 new places in TAFE over the next three years. Five hundred thousand Australians have enrolled in fee-free TAFE places. The government has invested $30 billion in the National Skills Agreement, where, together with states, we're seeking to expand vocational education and training in priority areas. That includes TAFE centres for excellence in critical and emerging industries. There's also $600 million invested into skills growth and development in clean energy, construction and manufacturing. These are things that will form foundations for economic growth in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The final aspect I'd like to talk about is changes to the Paid Parental Leave scheme. These changes have increased the period for which paid parental leave will be paid from 20 to 26 weeks over the period from July 2024 to July 2026. It expands and makes more flexible the circumstances in which paid parental leave can be accessed by parents of both genders. That radical organisation the Business Council of Australia itself supports the reforms on the basis that they are going to increase workforce participation among women and, it's thought, will also result in positive productivity gains in the long term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A former French premier said, 'To govern is to choose,' and ultimately this government has made choices that will yield long-term economic benefits for Australia. The same cannot be said for those opposite, who are yet to release serious policies about which of the spending proposals and cost-of-living measures will be cut, how they would change Australia's tax system, or which of the industrial relations reforms that are driving wages up and improving workplace conditions they would strip away. </span>

                  </a>  The government are so sensitive and so embarrassed about their terrible failure on housing that it seeks to obstruct debate. The reality is that after 2½ years Labor have failed on the supply side and the demand side. The Australian dream is slipping away from younger people, which is why under-40s are going crazy about this government's failure to build houses and help younger people get into their first home. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that there are fewer homes being built under this government than there were under the last government and there are fewer first home buyers getting into those few houses that are being constructed. So, after failing to legislate their key demand-side policy for more than 800 days, they now want to come in here and ask us to vote on it. Maybe it's because the election is approaching and they are embarrassed that the next time they have a campaign launch they'll be launching the same policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last 2½ years, the government have had a handful of policies on housing. One of them is what I call their 'corporate' housing policy, which Senator Gallagher loves, which is where the super funds and the foreign fund managers are given tax cuts and incentives to build, construct and own houses and then rent them out to Australians like they're serfs. This is part of their 'rent forever' plan, which is now underwritten in the budget in perpetuity. But what you never hear the government talk about is lending policy, banking policy or how we can help people get a first mortgage. The government never talk about that, even while banking policy is within the preserve of the Commonwealth government. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing you never hear them talk about is super, other than how they can help the funds own all their houses and become landlords. They never talk about people's lived reality, which is that we're living in an age where, because of compulsory super, a large group of people now have super as their biggest pool of capital. So, unless you have the access to the bank of mum and dad, which is now the sixth biggest lender, this is your best chance of getting into a house. The key determinant of your success in retirement is not your superannuation balance; it is your home ownership status. That is why we make no apology for allowing people to use their own money, unlike Labor, who see people using their own money as 'raiding'. It is a bizarre world they're living in.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer from the Minister for Emergency Management (Senator McAllister) to a question without notice I asked today relating to energy policy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My question was quite simple: how much is the government's net zero policy going to cost just for firming? Firming is the provision of what used to be called stable, synchronised baseload power to keep the lights on when the wind isn't blowing and the sun isn't shining. Firming wasn't needed when we had coal power because coal plants provide stable, synchronised baseload power day and night. Solar and wind don't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">AEMO estimates Australia will need 65 gigawatt hours of firming to guarantee grid stability. Depending on the time of year, that storage will need to be refilled each day to get the grid through the next night, including most of the evening and morning peak hours. Australia's energy consumption in 2023-24 shows that, in summer, for the morning peak hours we needed 36 gigawatt hours of power and for the evening peak hours 28 gigawatt hours. So AEMO's figure of 65 gigawatt hours of firming is about right. The $64 billion expense will be added to every Australian's power bill, or it will go onto your taxes. Either way, under the Albanese government you will pay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The $64 billion cost is just for one night. These batteries need to be refilled the next day with power from the grid. That means that every day we need a huge amount of solar and wind just to charge the batteries. One wet day preventing large-scale generation from solar and wind means the batteries will not be recharged, resulting in blackouts and energy management that I'll discuss tomorrow. It's clear that 65 gigawatts of capacity at $64 billion is not enough to avoid blackouts. We'll probably need twice that, as well as having to build extra solar and wind just to charge the batteries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyday Australians are up for hundreds of billions of dollars just for firming. That's in addition to the electricity needed on any day. This is an insane impost on every Australian struggling with paying for their groceries and insurance and with the cost of living under Labor. End the net zero mandates now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have been calling for changes to our donation laws for decades, and in this parliament it's clear that Labor would have the numbers, with the Greens and the crossbench, to progress genuine electoral reform. So I asked the minister whether he intends to keep the commitment this government made prior to the election to improve democracy and to reform our electoral laws, or whether, instead, he's seeking to stitch up a deal with the coalition that will benefit their own two parties but throw democracy under the bus. Well, I did get an acknowledgement from the Special Minister of State that we still haven't seen a draft bill and that it's taken longer than he had hoped it would, but unfortunately that was about the extent of the information that I received in relation to that question. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I then asked about fossil fuel companies, who are donating millions of dollars to both the large political parties, and in return, of course, those companies get billions of dollars of public money in fossil fuel subsidies, accelerated depreciation and cheap diesel fuel. That's simply turbocharging the climate crisis. So I asked the minister whether he would ban donations from fossil fuel companies and other sectors that try to buy influence, and I said that, instead, we could reform laws so that we act in the best interests of the community here rather than that of the highest bidder. But I didn't get much of a response to that either. I pointed out that twice now I've introduced a bill to ban donations from fossil fuel companies and other sectors with a track record of trying to buy influence, but there hasn't been any interest from either of the major parties in progressing these reforms. Why? It's not in the interests of their donor mates. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, the Minister for Resources tabled a provision that would have given her, rather than the environment minister, ultimate authority for offshore gas project approvals. Now, that proposal to bypass environmental approvals, which thankfully the Greens stopped, followed revelations that Minister King had received a request from the CEO of Santos to gag First Nations groups and to fast-track new offshore gas. Let me say that again in another way: Santos asked for the laws to change to bolster their own profits. We FOIed the letter. We have seen the receipts. Presumably Santos thought that its $110,000 donation last financial year made such a direct request to the minister perfectly reasonable. Who is this government working for—the Australian people or the fossil fuel industry?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens want to see electoral reform so that politics can work for the public interest and not for the highest bidder. Prime Minister Albanese made big promises about transparency and accountability before he came into government, but we've been waiting for over two years now and we are still yet to see or be meaningfully consulted on any electoral reform legislation from this government. The Special Minister of State keeps saying that people can talk to him; we're waiting for you to brief us on what your proposal is. Months and months on, we still have not seen the bill that you keep promising.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year I joined with crossbench colleagues to introduce an electoral reform bill that would improve transparency, introduce truth in political advertising, reduce the influence of lobbyists, level the playing field and increase territory representation. We have that bill ready to go. You can have the numbers to pass it. The Greens are ready to work for genuine electoral reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People are desperate for a parliament that's more diverse and more representative. They don't want the Coles and Woolies of Australian politics anymore and are sick of not being able to tell the difference between the two big parties on the issues that really matter to them. That is why support for the big parties is falling and it's exactly why the government has a choice. Do they want to stitch up a dirty deal on electoral reform with the Liberal Party so they can keep the donations rolling in from coal and gas, or are they going to commit to general electoral reforms that actually improve electoral outcomes? Only time will tell.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Greens Competition and Consumer Amendment (Make Price Gouging Illegal) Bill 2024 amends section 46 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Competition and Consumer Act 2010</span> (the Competition Act) to prohibit a corporation with substantial market power from abusing that power by charging an excessive price for a good or service, otherwise known as price gouging. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill is based on recommendation 1.5 of the February 2024 Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) Inquiry into Price Gouging led by former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Chair Professor Allan Fels, and recommendation 2 of the May 2024 Senate Select Committee on Supermarket Prices, initiated by the Greens and chaired by Senator Nick McKim. Both reports recommended amending Section 46 of the Competition Act to make it illegal to charge excessive prices in terms similar to the European Union provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Bill, the ACCC will be able to apply to the Court for an order where it believes a corporation has abused its market power by price gouging. If a corporation is found to have illegally price gouged, the Court can then impose orders under section 76 of the Competition Act, which include a maximum civil penalty of $50 million. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under section 87B of the Competition Act, the ACCC can also require enforceable undertakings by a corporation. The undertakings the ACCC may impose are sufficiently broad to allow the ACCC to require a corporation to lower the price of a product to the price it would cost if it was sold in a competitive market, for a specified period of time while guaranteeing supply of the product. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In effect, this means corporations that engage in illegal price gouging are not only liable for a significant civil penalty, but the ACCC and the courts can intervene to lower the price of a product, directly supporting people and communities who rely on that product. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To determine whether a price is excessive, the Bill requires the Court to consider the price of the product if the corporation did not have substantial market power. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The definition of an excessive price is deliberately kept broad to provide the courts the discretion to determine whether price gouging has occurred based on the circumstances of the case, noting that different industries will have different thresholds for what is considered an excessive price. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, it is recommended that in making a determination, the courts consider: </span>

                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Whether the price is excessive relative to the economic value of the product provided</span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Whether the price is excessive compared to if there was greater competition in the market </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Whether a corporation has used the cover of an unusual event that has led to a shortage of a good or service or where there is excessive demand for a good or service, to increase prices above what is required to cover an increase in input costs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also exempts small businesses, defined as a corporation or body corporate with less than $10 million annual turnover. It is unlikely a small business would meet the threshold for substantial market power under the Bill. However, as a precaution, small businesses have been made exempt from the contravention, as the aim of this Bill is to stop massive corporations from price gouging, not target small businesses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill responds to the urgent need to rein in corporate price gouging and profiteering to bring down the cost of goods and services across the economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's economy is getting much less competitive as top firms hold a high and growing share of market power. Lack of competition allows corporations to take advantage of their dominant market power to hike prices above what would be required to meet increases in their input costs. Corporations are incentivised to price gouge as it boosts profits and the pay and bonuses of their executives. Yet price gouging drives up the cost of essential products, inflicting pain on everyday people and worsening inflation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Reserve Bank Governor, Michelle Bullock, and economists across the world, including at the OECD, the IMF, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve, and former ACCC Chair Professor Allan Fels, agree that some corporations are taking advantage of their market power and using the cover of inflation to push up prices. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since the Labor Government came to power in 2022, the cost of food is up by 10.5%, rents have gone up by 31% and the average mortgage payment has gone up by $1,667 a month. Power bills, insurance costs and medical bills have all increased significantly. While costs of essentials have soared, wages have not kept up, making it even harder for millions of people to make ends meet. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Meanwhile, the country's biggest corporations are raking in massive profits off the back of the community's pain. Australia's biggest energy retailer, Origin, reported an almost one third jump in profit to $1.2 billion in the 2023-24 Financial Year. Supermarket giant, Coles, reported an 8% jump in profit to $1.1 billion. The country's biggest insurer, Insurance Australia Group, posted a $900 million profit, up 8% on the year before, off the back of rising premiums. While people's rents and mortgage repayments have skyrocketed, Commonwealth Bank raked in a whopping $9.48 billion profit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The dollars extracted from price gouging consumers flow to corporate CEOs too. Recent analysis by the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors shows chief executives of Australia's largest corporations take home on average 50 times the pay of a typical worker. In the early 1990's, top bosses earned about 17 times average earnings. We know from the Senate Select Committee on Supermarket Prices that Woolworths CEO, Brad Banducci, received $8.65 million in 2023, around 127 times the full-time pay of a Woolies shop-floor worker. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The share of income going to big corporations has never been higher while the wages share of total income hasn't been this low since 1964. Wherever you look, massive corporations and their CEOs are profiteering from people's pain and making the cost-of-living crisis worse. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This has to end, which is exactly why the Greens have introduced a Bill to make price gouging illegal. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Banning price gouging should not be radical or controversial. The UK has banned price gouging since 1998. Canada amended its competition law late last year to specifically prohibit price gouging. The European Union has banned price gouging since 1958 through the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Several states in the US prohibit price gouging during emergencies, and Vice-President, Kamala Harris has promised, if elected, to enact a federal law against supermarket price gouging. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many jurisdictions have successfully used the price gouging provisions in their competition toolkit to crack down on corporate price gouging and protect people from unfair prices. For example, in 2020, the European Commission analysed the accounts of pharmaceutical giant, Aspen, and found Aspen had used its market dominance to impose an unjustified price increase of up to several hundred per cent on critical cancer medicines. The Commission ordered Aspen to reduce the net price of the cancer medicines by 73% for ten years, with guaranteed supply for 5 years. Italy's national competition authority also fined Aspen $5 million euros for abusing its market power by charging excessive prices. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Yet here in Australia, the Albanese Labor Government and the Liberals won't even admit corporations are price gouging, let alone do anything to stop them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ACTU Inquiry into Price Gouging led by Professor Allan Fels recommended amending section 46 of the Competition Act to make it illegal to charge excessive prices in terms similar to the European Union provisions. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The report states: </span>

                    </span>
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">Despite the fact that the greatest concern of economists with monopoly or market power is harmful high prices, high and unfair prices are not prohibited by competition law [in Australia]. There has been an ideologically-driven resistance to competition law addressing this feature of monopoly behaviour in Australia and in North America. </span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is clear there is a massive gap in Australia's competition law which allows corporations with market dominance to price gouge—unchecked. As long as the Labor and Liberal parties accept millions of dollars in political donations from their corporate mates each year, they will continue to put the interests of massive corporations ahead of everyday people and communities. </span>

                  </a>  The entire purpose of this motion, as I understood it, was to put a very clear timetable on the response to the royal commission. This is in circumstances where, as the royal commission itself noted, countless previous reports with hundreds and hundreds of recommendations have not had even close to a substantive response. With the amendment that has just been passed, the very purpose of the motion has been defeated. Veterans are asking themselves what commitment they have that this will be any different to any of the other recommendations or reports. The whole purpose of the motion has been defeated by this amendment moved by the government and supported by the opposition. For those reasons, the Greens will not be supporting this amended motion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  Today marks two years since the killing of Mahsa 'Jina' Amini at the hands of the Islamic Republic of Iran regime. Her tragic death sparked the Woman, Life, Freedom protests, which saw so many Iranian women, girls and young people bravely put their lives on the line to challenge a deeply misogynistic regime which uses fear and violence to maintain its grip on power. The astounding courage that Iranian women showed to stand up and challenge the regime by refusing to cover their hair, as the IRI regime demands that women and girls must, was inspirational but also profoundly shocking to those of us who are fortunate to live in countries where this kind of repression is almost unthinkable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Woman, Life, Freedom movement in support of Iranian women spread around the world. Here in Australia, tens of thousands of people attended vigils and protests calling for action by Western governments to hold the IRI regime accountable for its abhorrent actions; to hold them accountable for Mahsa Amini's death and the death of so many other protesters and civilians; to hold them accountable for the gross violations of women's human rights in Iran; to hold them accountable for the terrorism which they support—terrorism which is designed to help spread the evil ideology of the Islamic Republic to neighbouring countries; and to hold them accountable for the deaths, the sexual violence and repression of women and girls that their ideology and their terrorism causes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Senate has on a number of occasions joined together to condemn unreservedly the killing of Mahsa Amini and the appalling mistreatment of women and girls by the IRI regime. In doing so, the Senate agreed unanimously to a Senate inquiry into the human rights implications of the regime's violence. The inquiry, which I was privileged to chair, reported at the start of February 2023 and made 12 recommendations for urgent action by the Australian government. Among those crucial recommendations were that the Australian government should take the steps to enable a terror listing of the IRGC and that the relevant ministers should report to parliament on the intimidation and threats by the IRI regime, something that has been confirmed is occurring. We recommend that the government should minimise relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran regime in recognition of the appalling behaviour of that regime. And we recommend any Iranian officials in Australia considered to be involved in intimidation, threats or monitoring of Australians be expelled. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two years on from the death of Mahsa Amini, how much has really changed? Women and girls in Iran continue to suffer violence at the hands of authorities. The IRI regime has dramatically expanded its terrorism in the Middle East, including by funding and supporting Hamas to carry out the horrific October 7 attacks in which more than 1,200 innocent people, including defenceless women and children, were slaughtered in cold blood. The IRI regime continues to move closer to developing a nuclear bomb. It continues to increase its support for and delivery of weapons to Russia and it continues to threaten, intimidate and spy on critics around the world, including here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to acknowledge that the IRI regime have been allowed to develop a model in which the worse their behaviour is the more we are told we cannot afford to take action to hold them accountable. We still have not listed the IRGC as a terrorism organisation nor taken any steps to do so. We still have the Iranian ambassador openly advocating extreme antisemitism and the eradication of a democratic nation. We still have Australians living in fear that the regime is watching them and threatening their families. If the Islamic republic regime is able to get away with its human rights abuses and terrorism, others will continue to follow. Look at what is happening once again to women in Afghanistan right now under Taliban rule. How long until we hear how important it is to engage and to have dialogue with the Taliban, as we are told that we must with the IRI regime?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We owe it to Mahsa 'Gina' Amini and to the women of Iran and to the women all around the world, oppressed and mistreated by those in power, not to move our attention onto something else and in doing so normalise and accept this behaviour.</span>

                  <a href="281503" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CICCONE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  I am also rising to add a contribution to the MPI brought forward by Senator Chandler. From the outset, I pay my respects on the second anniversary of the death of Mahsa Amini, whose Kurdish name was Gina. Her death rightly received widespread global condemnation and generated months of protests in Iran which were brutally suppressed by Iranian security forces. According to the United Nations, at least 551 people were killed during these protests, including 49 women and 68 children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amini's tragic death was infuriating when it occurred and it remains so today, but let me be clear; her death will not be in vain. And this is the view of the Albanese government, who wholeheartedly endorses the sentiment. A lot of her family and friends are committed to seeing change within Iran. The government has repeatedly raised concerns directly with Iran's diplomatic representatives and continues to apply pressure on the Iranian regime. In fact, our government has taken stronger action against Iran on human rights than any previous government in this place has. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Penny Wong, also today announced that the Australian government is imposing additional targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on another five Iranian individuals. This includes very senior security and law enforcement officials who have been involved in the repression of protests in Iran. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In late 2022, I served as the deputy chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, which had an inquiry into human rights implications of recent violence in Iran. At the time, I reiterated the government's condemnation of the violent measures that were employed by the Iranian government against those who had been protesting the oppression of its own citizens. I again place my solidarity with the Iranian people on the record here today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The appalling conduct of the IRGC and the threat it poses to international security and Iran's own people cannot be ignored. The IRGC must be held to account, so I understand why people rightly are seeking every possible way to take action against the IRGC. The Australian government is very much focused on taking meaningful steps to increase pressure on the IRGC and to hold them to account. This is why the government has now sanctioned 195 Iran-linked individuals and entities, including almost 100 individuals and entities that are linked to the IRGC, since the protests began back in September 2022. Federal Labor's concern about the conduct of the IRGC predates the ongoing protests, which is why the former Labor government sanctioned the IRGC as a whole in 2010. In fact, it is the only government—a federal Labor administration—that has put sanctions on the IRGC. Unlike previous governments who spent almost a decade talking about action and did nothing about it, federal Labor is the only party that has taken decisive action against the IRGC. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The strength of the Woman, Life, Freedom movement has grown since the death of Jina. Sadly, however, the human rights situation in Iran remains deeply concerning, especially for women and girls. Earlier this year, Iranian authorities launched new measures to enforce compulsory hijab laws through increased surveillance cameras and harassment for women who fail to comply with this dress code. No-one anywhere in the world should be discriminated against on the grounds of their gender, and it's incumbent on the government to hold Iran to account for its violations of human rights. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the extraordinary courage of those in Iran and abroad who continue to express their fierce opposition to the oppressive practices of the Iranian government, often at great risk. Iran must uphold the fundamental rights of all citizens, and our government stands united with Iranian women and girls in their struggle for equality and empowerment. </span>

I want to read from a release put out by the United Nations Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Islamic Republic of Iran on 13 September 2024. It's titled 'Update on the situation of women and girls in the context of the September 2022 protests and the "Woman, Life, Freedom" movement in the Islamic Republic of Iran'. I quote:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just reflect on that. These are Iranian families who've lost family members who died as a result of these protests and as a result of the actions of the Iranian regime, and now these family members of protesters who've been killed are themselves being subject to persecution, particularly in Iran's minority provinces, including Sistan and Baluchestan, Kurdistan and West Azerbaijan.

                <span class="HPS-Small">On this day, the Mission reiterates its call to the Islamic Republic of Iran to investigate and prosecute crimes against protesters, including women and girls … In light of ongoing persecutory acts against women and girls, coupled with the absence of meaningful justice and accountability for protesters and their families within Iran, States must continue to place the situation of women and girls in the Islamic Republic of Iran high on the international agenda.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to some of the courageous women who continue to fight for freedom within the borders of Iran. I speak of Zhina Modares Gorji, a Kurdish women's rights activist who was arrested by plain-clothes agents in September 2022 and was sentenced by the Revolutionary Court to 21 years in prison and internal exile for her public support, including on social media, of the Woman, Life, Freedom movement. I pay tribute to Sharifeh Mohammadi, a labour activist originally from East Azerbaijan province and residing in Rasht city, who was sentenced to death by branch 1 of the Revolutionary Court for armed rebellion against the state, based on allegations of membership of an opposition group. I pay tribute to Pakshan Azizi, a Kurdish activist, who was the second woman sentenced to death in July. On 17 July 2024, branch 26 of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran sentenced Ms Azizi on charges of so-called armed rebellion against the state—again, for her alleged membership of the Kurdistan Free Life Party. I pay tribute to Varisheh Moradi and Nasim Simiari, two women activists who remain at serious risk of the death penalty, having been charged with the same national security offences. And I pay tribute to Nobel Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, who has continued to advocate for equality and freedom as part of the Woman, Life, Freedom movement while she has been in custody.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This chamber will continue to advocate to support those seeking freedom within the borders of Iran, and we will continue to advocate for and show solidarity with our wonderful Iranian diaspora across the whole of Australia. I say to the Iranian government and to the Iranian regime: any threats, any persecution or any attack on those within our borders who form part of the Iranian diaspora is an attack on this institution, an attack on our freedoms and an attack on every single elected member of parliament. We are watching, we are supporting our Iranian diaspora and we support Woman, Life, Freedom.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:34</span>):  Today I too want to address the ongoing and grave situation in Iran as we mark the second anniversary of the tragic death of Mahsa Jina Amini. I begin by highlighting the decisive steps the Australian government has taken in response to Iran's continued human rights violations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this government, we have taken stronger action against Iran on human rights than under any previous Australian government. We have imposed targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on 195 Iran linked individuals and entities, including almost 100 associated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. This action underscores our commitment to holding the Iranian regime accountable for its severe human rights violations against women and girls and against free speech. Just today, my colleague Senator Wong, Minister for Foreign Affairs, has announced additional targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on an additional five Iranian individuals. As mentioned earlier by Senator Ciccone, these are senior security and law enforcement officials who have been directly involved in the violent repression of protests in Iran. This strategic action is part of our broader commitment to challenging the regime's ongoing abuses and ensuring those responsible face consequences. It also sits alongside the Australian government's internationally known stance for strong, evidence based advocacy on the abolition of the death penalty. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has expanded the scope of the Iran autonomous sanctions regime specifically to address the oppression of women and girls in Iran and the general oppression of the population. On this two-year anniversary of the horror that has unfolded, let's remember: Mahsa Jina Amini was a young Kurdish Iranian woman arrested in September 2022 for improperly wearing her hijab. Her arrest, alleged torture and subsequent death in custody sparked a wave of protests, driven by a demand for justice, equality and fundamental freedoms. The Iranian regime's response to these peaceful demonstrations was brutally repressive, with security forces violently quashing dissent and causing the deaths of more than 500 people, including women and children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two years on from Mahsa Amini's death, the human rights situation in Iran remains deeply troubling. We have seen escalating violence against these extraordinarily brave activists, who are standing up in defiance. Yet they are showing unbelievable courage in rising up against the sort of oppression that we here in Australia could never imagine. Earlier this year, Iranian authorities intensified their enforcement of mandatory hijab laws, using increased surveillance and harassment to control women's choices and suppress dissent. The regime has also escalated its use of the death penalty, with over 400 executions recorded this year alone, including of 15 women. The oppression extends to ethnic and religious minorities, arbitrary detentions and the persecution of human rights defenders. The regime's actions have a chilling effect on free expression and basic human rights both within Iran and beyond its borders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In stark contrast to the Albanese government's proactive stance, the previous government took no significant action against the Iranian regime. During their nine years in office, they did not impose a single new sanction on Iran, nor did they challenge Iran's position on the UN Commission on the Status of Women, despite the regime's record of human rights abuses. I am proud that our government has been at the forefront of international efforts to remove Iran from the Commission on the Status of Women. We have consistently raised our concerns directly with the Iranian government, demonstrating our commitment to human rights and justice. The opposition may criticise our approach, but, when we look at their record, the facts speak for themselves. Over nine years in government, we saw their inaction and silence. There was not a single new sanction on Iran. There was not one word of complaint when Iran was elected to the UN Commission on the Status of Women, a committee they were a member of. This government has demonstrated a clear and unwavering commitment to holding the Iranian regime accountable and supporting the brave individuals fighting for their rights in Iran. We use actions, not just words.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we reflect on Mahsa Amini's legacy today, along with the continuing acts of bravery by Iranian women and other people, plus others around the world in defiance through their various acts of resistance, we reaffirm our support for the people of Iran, especially the activists—the women and girls who continue to show immense courage in their struggle for equality and freedom. This government stands in solidarity with them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  On 8 December 2022, a young man, Mohsen Shekari, was hanged in an Iranian prison; he was taken to the gallows. Witnesses said he cried out, 'I sacrifice my life for Iran.' This young man was the first known execution triggered by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini. Her crime was not wearing her headscarf properly and joining protests demanding more freedom for women in Iran. According to Amnesty International, women and girls are being imprisoned and assaulted in increasing numbers for not wearing a veil or for driving a car without a man, and the parliament in Iran is close to passing laws that will make it easier for police and security services to oppress, arrest and imprison women and girls. It is disgraceful, and Iran should be called out for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank Senator Chandler for bringing on this important matter today. It's nice to see the Australian Greens senator, Larissa Waters, also speaking up for women in the Middle East. That's not something they've been making a habit of this year. I was waiting for them to bring on a motion about what the Taliban is doing. The Taliban have cooked up more laws that not only tell women they have to hide their faces and their bodies but that also tell women they are now not allowed to use their voices outside their homes. They're not allowed to go to school beyond sixth class, and women aren't allowed to work or go to gyms or parks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think the Greens might have more to say about this, but the Australian Greens haven't brought a single motion forward in the 47th Parliament about the treatment of women in Iran and Afghanistan—not a word about the Taliban and not a word about Iran. Do you know why? It's because they are hypocrites. They choose which groups of women they're going to help and which they're not. This is how it works. We've seen this with the footwear and textile ladies in the CFMEU. They would rather stand up for the bullies of the CFMEU. They're happy to whip up hate and division, but they're not happy standing up for the rights of women in the Middle East. Today is just not going to do it at all.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  It has been two years since the death of Jina Mahsa Amini, and Iranians are still subject to violence and terror. In the first half of this year, 249 people were executed by the Iranian regime. Last year, Iran committed 74 per cent of all recorded executions in the world. Iranians are being subjected to what human rights groups are describing accurately as 'sham trials' for crimes such as peacefully protesting or improperly wearing a hijab as a woman—the same crime that Jina was accused of. These trials are too often resulting in people being subject to arbitrary sentences of arbitrary length or, indeed, death sentences. Too many innocent Iranians are losing their lives, are being subject to oppression and suppression, and are simply being silenced. Too many families have experienced pain and loss under this regime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Australian Greens welcome the sanctions put in place by the government, there is still so much more that can, and must, be done. The Iranian people are calling for the Australian government to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation. I am in awe of the courage that has been, and continues to be, demonstrated by women's rights activists who are right now conducting a hunger strike and protesting in prison these disgraceful policies. We are in solidarity with these brave protesters. Women, life, freedom. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is a terrorist organisation.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHARMA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  Two years ago, Mahsa Amini was killed in the custody of the Iranian state. She had been arrested by the morality police for not complying with Iran's strict and sexually based dress code. At the time, her death appeared to mark a watershed in Iranian political life. Young people, elderly people and people from the cities as well as from rural and non-urban areas took to the streets demanding that the state at last respect their dignity and their fundamental human rights. Chants of 'Women, life, freedom' echoed through the streets of Tehran and other major cities in Iran. Mothers protested alongside their daughters, and farmers alongside university students. It was a period of immense optimism, and the courage shown by those who took to the streets to defy the heavy hand of the state remains an admirable study in courage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'm sad to say that two years later—two years to the day after the death of Mahsa Amini in custody—that small candle of hope that burned for a time in Iran has been extinguished. We have seen at least 551 people killed during those protests. We've seen thousands arrested. We've seen at least 10 that we know of executed in connection with the protests. And the heavy hand of the Islamic Republic of Iran has come down mercilessly on those who simply sought to protect their own freedoms. The morality police are back on the streets enforcing the dress code. The future of Iran's people remains as hopeless as ever. Iran continues to support terrorism and to foment instability in the region. Iran continues to funnel weapons to terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis in Yemen—even to Russia, in its war with Ukraine. And Iran continues to execute people at a simply barbaric rate. According to international reports, there have been 345 executions in Iran already this year. There were 853 people executed in 2023. This is industrial-scale use of the death penalty. Iran is one of the most flagrant abusers of the right to life—one of the most excessive users of the death penalty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's indicative of a state that is bereft of any moral legitimacy or moral authority. It is a state for whom the instilling of societal fear is the only way for the regime to hold on to power, because the promises of the Islamic revolution have simply not been met. Iran's people are frustrated. They are denied economic opportunity. They continue to be discriminated against on the basis of their gender, their ethnicity or their religion. And they continue to be denied basic and fundamental freedoms and human rights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are chilling reports, even now, of family members of those who were killed or executed or punished during the protests now themselves being harassed, arrested and punished by the regime to perpetuate intergenerational trauma, if you like, on people who were only standing up for their basic civil liberties—Mashallah Karami, for instance, the father of Mohammad Karami. Mohammad was executed in January 2023, aged 22, for his involvement in the protests. His father, Mashallah, who has simply campaigned on the behalf of his son's memory, was sentenced to six years in jail in May, and then, in August, sentenced to another term of nine years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This, frankly, is a rogue regime. Iran cares nothing for the welfare of its people. It cares nothing for its neighbourhood. It is a repressive regime that uses the tools of terror, fear and intimidation to keep control of its society.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What do the billionaires who run the world do when we, the people, realise how much has been stolen from us—how much money, how much sovereignty, how much opportunity?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the next few minutes, it will become obvious what this has to do with the misinformation and disinformation bill—'m-a-d' or 'mad', for short. The world's predatory billionaires do not wield their power directly; they hide behind wealth funds such as BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street and First State. These funds act in concert with political change agents, including large superannuation and sovereign wealth funds such as Norges. The racket these subversive elements are running really is racketeering. They use their wealth to buy shares in companies that are then required to follow the agenda. This is not my opinion; these are the exact words of BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Buying out Western civilisation is an expensive business. The never-ending quest for more money, more power and more control is being noticed and resisted. Much of that resistance has been as a result of Elon Musk buying X and allowing the truth to live in one mainstream forum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minute the BlackRock racketeers walk into a boardroom, any notion of public interest is abandoned. A case in point is Coles and Woolies, who used to pride themselves on providing the necessities of life—food and clothing—at the lowest possible price through competition. With the presence of an almost complete set of predatory wealth funds on their share registers, Coles and Woolies no longer compete against each other. Instead, they collude to pursue a pricing strategy designed to maximise profit from our necessities of life—profit that's sent overseas into the coffers of these sovereign wealth funds, leaving Australians permanently poorer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2022-23, around an election, Woolies donated $110,000 to the ALP. In 2022-23, other industries under the control of these predatory wealth funds, including the big pharmaceutical industry, donated a million dollars to the ALP. What do they get for their money? Last Tuesday, I spoke in favour of the report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee inquiry into a prospective terms of reference for a royal commission into the COVID response. Despite me simply agreeing with the committee report and despite my using only peer reviewed and published science to support my position, Senator Ayres from the Labor Party chose to describe my words as—listen to this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… damaging misinformation and disinformation … there is a reason why the ASIO director-general highlights the role of extremist misinformation and disinformation in terms of its corrosive effect. It does lead to some of the acts of violent extremism here and overseas, motivated by the same vile conspiracy theories that we've just heard …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wow, what a rant! No data, no argument; just empty labels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our New Zealand friends started their royal commission into COVID in December 2022. New Zealand has now decided that the royal commission unearthed so much behaviour that was cause for concern they've expanded the royal commission to include looking into COVID in much greater depth, including vaccine harm. The New Zealand royal commission now closely resembles the royal commission the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee recommended following their inquiry initiated on a One Nation referral. For Senator Ayres to say this is extremist misinformation and disinformation likely to lead to acts of violent extremism is a complete slap in the face to New Zealand's royal commission and one that Senator Ayres would be well advised to reconsider.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the trouble when the government panics that $1 million in donations is at risk and brings on a bill that will shut up any opposition to the rule of the billionaires through their front companies—in this case, pharmaceutical companies—a rule that is, quite simply, a threat to the future of our beautiful country. With total clarity, Senator Ayres has drawn the battle lines here. What is the truth in the New Zealand parliament is 'extremist misinformation and disinformation' in Australia, if the Ayres government says it is. This bill has no protections and no checks and balances—it should rightly be renamed the 'crush any opposition to the billionaires' bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Labor Party's desire for totalitarian censorship is no surprise, the people need to be aware that the Morrison-Littleproud Liberals and Nationals introduced this bill. Opposition leader Dutton makes no indication of whether he intends to oppose the bill, I guess because when he gets in he'll be happy to use its onerous provisions. While I don't have time to go into the Liberal Party's donations from companies under the control of the world's predatory billionaires, the same issue affects both parties. The Morrison-Littleproud government kept the COVID vaccine contracts hidden despite our requests to make the contracts public for those who paid for the injections—taxpayers. The temptation to have extra money to spend in an election campaign has proven far too much for the major parties, and their independence, objectivity and common sense have been compromised. The world's predatory billionaires' downfall will be their hubris. The question is: who will go down with them?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'SULLIVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  I rise today to speak on this very important matter. I think we can all agree that Australia is the greatest country in the world. It didn't become that by accident and it will not remain this way by accident either. We as Australians must continually make active decisions to fight for, protect and defend our freedoms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Someone who understood this in their time was German theologian and pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was well known for his resistance to the Nazi regime in World War II. He was a key figure in the Confessing Church, which opposed Adolf Hitler's control over the German Church. Bonhoeffer was eventually imprisoned and executed. In his influential book <span style="font-style:italic;">The Cost of Discipleship</span>, he introduced the concept of cheap grace. By 'cheap grace', Bonhoeffer meant a grace that demands nothing from the believer. It's cheap because it costs nothing and asks for no change or commitment. In a similar way, Australia risks adopting a mindset of cheap grace with regard to its freedoms. Many Australians enjoy freedoms like freedom of speech, assembly and religion, and they often take them for granted, expecting that, without fulfilling the accompanying responsibilities, these rights would follow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">True freedom, like Bonhoeffer's idea of costly grace, requires active defence, accountability and sometimes sacrifice. Without this commitment, Australia risks devaluing the freedoms that are so essential to its democracy. Winning the lottery of life and growing up in Australia means you have a leg up compared to so many other places across the world. Yet it seems that this Labor government is set on restricting freedoms for some while enhancing the rights for others, undermining our fundamental freedoms. We saw it with their divisive Voice referendum, an attempt by the Prime Minister to divide Australians on the basis of race. What happened to advancing Australia fair?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, we have also seen the attack on religious freedoms, through their proposed religious discrimination bill. The Australian Law Reform Commission has recommended the repeal of section 38 of the Sex Discrimination Act. Doing so will make it illegal for faith based schools to uphold their principles by choosing only to hire teachers who affirm and support the ethos of their school. Justice Rothman, the author of the ALRC report, disclosed that he was constrained by the terms of reference set for him by the Attorney-General. This alarming revelation underscores the government's active role and desire to repeal section 38. The Albanese government, through their commissioned ALRC report, want to throw the majority of Australians under the bus to pander to a fraction of the population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the latest census data, over 54 per cent of Australians identify as religious; 95 per cent of private schools are religious; and, nationally, those religious schools make up over 30 per cent of schools in Australia. That's 1.5 million students and tens of thousands of teachers that support them. The removal of section 38 will remove the current protections allowing schools to maintain their values and faith. It's not just schools; it will open up religious institutions and places of worship to further attack. The erosion of these freedoms is not only concerning, but it sets a dangerous precedent where the state is given too much power to dictate the boundaries of legitimate expression and assembly. We now have the Prime Minister's misinformation and disinformation bill. The original draft was a disaster to our freedoms, and, at first glance, the latest version seems to be no better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The pace of the advancement of the opponents of freedom has accelerated in recent years. We need to boldly stand up against it before we lose our advantage completely and, importantly, to reclaim what's been lost. As that great freedom warrior of the 1980s President Ronald Reagan once said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. The only way they can inherit the freedom we have known is if we fight for it, protect it, defend it, and then hand it to them with the well fought lessons of how they in their lifetime must do the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like Reagan said, now is the time for us to fight for freedom, to protect freedom and to defend freedom.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:58</span>):  The Albanese government is committed to a robust discussion of diverse views and opinions as a necessary part of a vibrant and effective democracy. Freedom of expression and peaceful assemblies are protected in Australia by domestic and international law, and implied freedom of political communication is enshrined in the Australian Constitution. That implied freedom can be limited or burdened but only by laws that are reasonably appropriate and adapted to serving a legitimate end and in a manner which is compatible with Australia's system of representative and responsible government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The right to freedom of expression is also recognised in article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia is a party. Article 19(2) protects freedom of expression in any medium. That includes written and oral communications, the media, public protest, broadcasting, artistic works and commercial advertising. While the right extends to the protection of unpopular ideas, international law recognises that freedom of expression carries with it special responsibilities and may be restricted on several grounds when necessary, such as the protection of the rights or reputations of others, national security, public order or public health.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The right to peaceful assembly is recognised in article 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The right to peaceful assembly protects the rights of individuals and groups to meet for a common purpose or to exchange ideas and information, to express their views publicly and to hold peaceful protest. The right extends to all gatherings for peaceful purposes, regardless of the degree of public support for the purpose of the gathering. However, the right applies only to peaceful assemblies and not to those involving any violence. The government is committed to upholding Australia's laws and its international commitments protecting freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.</span>

Unfortunately, Labor and Liberal both lean toward censorship. They both lean toward the desire to silence Australian citizens. It was, after all, the Liberal Party who created the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, an office which has only been emboldened by the Labor Party. It was also the Liberal Party who originally gave us the misinformation and disinformation bill under the tenure of former communications minister Paul Fletcher. When it comes to the stifling of people's rights to speak freely, both major parties are on a unity ticket.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If freedom of speech is not protected, then our government could become, as former NZ prime minister Jacinda Ardern said, our sole source of truth. Without the ability to speak freely and to raise a dissenting voice, we would all have to believe that men who consider themselves women are in fact actually women. That's the government line, and everyone knows it's ridiculous. Without the ability to speak freely, we could be forced to believe that immigration is not out of control or that there is no housing crisis at all. We would be made to sit and listen to politicians spouting nonsense while disbelieving our own lying eyes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember when the government told us that the COVID vaccine was safe and effective? The ability to call BS on official advice is not only an Australian trait but also a vital human trait. To ban the public from looking government in the eye and calling out its bureaucratic spin is to enslave the population to propaganda. It is also to transform our free country into a dystopian, autocratic nightmare. The government can wave around their misinformation and disinformation bill all they like, but I deserve my right to say that your health advice is unhealthy, your immigration policy is garbage, your climate catastrophism is laughable, your energy policy is just fantasy, your misinformation bill is fascism, your abortion policy is murderous, your eSafety Commissioner is tyrannical and your fluid definition of gender, which even a child knows to be wrong, makes you look like a bunch of silly idiots. Long live free speech.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:03</span>):  Before I respond in detail to the motion, I'd like to clarify something. While the Greens agree with the thrust of it, we should be clear that, yes, these rights are inalienable at their core, but that does not mean that they cannot be subject to such restrictions as are necessary for the safety of people, including to prevent vilification and hate speech, and we've just had a short demonstration of why that's important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no coincidence that the antiprotest laws are increasing right as global temperatures are. It's no coincidence that attempts to clamp down on dissent on university campuses and in the streets are increasing as global injustice shows its real face. It's no coincidence that antiwar protesters are being met with violence and that those standing for peace face brutality. Responding to threats of environmental catastrophe and social upheaval by more policing and harsher laws, which is the Labor and coalition trend, is a disturbing global trend, and the creeping patchwork of authoritarian state laws is chipping away at a fundamental political right in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last decade has seen governments across the country start pulling apart the right to protest, empowering police and criminalising dissent, and it's getting worse. Laws are limiting the right to publicly disagree with governments in real and meaningful ways, and we need to resist those. We all know that protests, strikes and other forms of collective action are how rights have been gained, from a five-day week to workers compensation, voting rights and, more recently, key environmental protections and marriage equality. The streets have been places of political action. They've shown politicians the strength of public will, and they've forced places like this to make changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Protest isn't incidental to democracy; it's a necessary feature of the system. The right to freedom of assembly is contained in international laws that Australia is a party to, and it is at least to some extent, a very marginal extent, ingrained in the Constitution through the implied freedom of political communication. Antiprotest laws have been used to target climate campaigners and certain locations, have expanded police powers to unprecedented levels and have led to more search-and-seizure powers and harsher penalties almost across the board in this country. Those in the major parties talk big, opposing crackdowns on protests overseas, but they are steadily slicing away at the very same right in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about freedom of speech, we need to also talk about whistleblowers. We talk about those who told the truth about war crimes in Afghanistan, like David McBride, who's right now in prison a few short kilometres from this parliament, while those in charge at the time are resting at home and shining their medals. We've also seen the very real penalties—in their employment and out on the streets—faced by those speaking the truth on the genocide in Gaza. Here, too, the need for the protection of freedom of speech is real. But many of those who advocate for their right to freedom of speech fall silent here. We won't be silent. Free Palestine. Free Gaza. Ceasefire now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:06</span>):  I thank Senator Roberts for bringing this urgency motion to the Senate, and I stand to speak in support of it. The rights to peaceful assembly and protest are freedoms that form the bedrock of our democracy. They have been the driving forces behind significant progress throughout our history. Environmental conservation, women's suffrage and the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have all been advanced through protest. Yet today the right to peaceful protest is under unprecedented attack. We are seeing laws and regulations being enacted to limit and suppress the voices of Australians seeking to exercise their right to protest. This not only threatens our ability to gather in peaceful protests. It threatens the very foundation of our democracy, because peaceful protest is more than just a public demonstration; it is an act of civic engagement—a way for people to voice dissent and demand change when traditional political channels fail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent times we have seen the criminalisation of peaceful protests on major roads, with criminal penalties of up to two years in prison. We have seen penalties for merely obstructing public places increased from 750 bucks to $50,000. Even more concerning is the normalisation of repressive tactics. Climate activists are now facing legal action from major corporations in the form of strategic lawsuits against public participation, referred to as SLAPP lawsuits. These lawsuits aim to intimidate and silence activists through costly and time-consuming litigation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why we must act now to protect these rights before they are further eroded. We need clear legal frameworks that prioritise human rights, not laws that restrict them—because protest is not a disruption; it's democracy in action. It is how citizens hold power to account and ensure that governments serve the people, not the other way around. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rights to peaceful association and protest are too important to be left undefended. We must stand up for these rights now, before they are lost. Most importantly, we must ensure that future generations inherit a democracy where every voice can be heard and where peaceful protest and non-violent direct action are not only protected but celebrated.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:09</span>):  A few years ago, former prime minister Scott Morrison responded to police violence towards peaceful protesters by telling people that they were lucky their protests were not being met with bullets. This year the current Prime Minister watched on as Victoria Police, armed to the teeth, descended upon antiwar demonstrators like an army in combat, shooting civilians with their hands up with rubber bullets, pepper-spraying old and young alike, throwing stun grenades and running people down with police horses.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Peaceful protest is crucial for realising all human rights. Many of us, including First Peoples, owe our human rights more to protests than to the goodwill of politicians. Around the world, from Ukraine to Palestine and the streets of Melbourne, the right to protest is being questioned and challenged. This is a human right that is protected by international law. Instead of questioning whether or not protesters deserve to be violently attacked by police, we should be questioning why it is that police have these weapons in the first place. We should be asking why police forces are becoming increasingly militarised and using weapons on civilians that were previously promoted at the very weapons expos people are protesting against.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the military-industrial complex showing its power and influence over our daily lives. From fuelling genocides across the globe to arming police forces, the militarisation of police in this country is accelerating alongside the increased criminalisation of the right to protest. The state is using laws and powers against human rights defenders, those protecting against violence, war, ecocide and genocide. Investing in war and weapons does not keep us safe. It does the opposite. Yet our tax dollars are being used to protect the merchants of death, arms manufacturers and governments, who will use their purchases to commit war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of giving billions of dollars to corporations profiting off war and genocide, we could be directing those funds to health care, education, housing and essential services. Again, I give a shout-out to pro-Palestine protesters who are out there every day, putting their bodies on the line against genocide. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:12</span>):  I rise today to speak in favour of Senator Roberts's motion that freedom of speech and peaceful freedom of assembly are inalienable rights which the Senate must defend. I'll touch on the freedom of assembly first of all. I know that we had a very big rally here a couple of years ago at the front of Parliament House. I think we had well over 100,000 people here. That was a very peaceful assembly, and I acknowledge everyone that turned out that day and travelled from across the country to attend that rally here in Canberra. I must admit that at the start of that day I thought we'd be lucky to get through this without some arrests, but my understanding is that they got through the whole day without any arrests—there may have been one, at worst.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, yes, freedom of speech is very important. As we found out last week, that itself is being attacked by the Labor government through the misinformation and disinformation bill. I'll always say that we must treat people with respect—that is very important—but we also must defend the right to debate different points of view in a respectful manner. This misinformation and disinformation bill is not even a cloak-and-dagger type bill. It outwardly says that governments, the media and education institutions are all exempt from the bill. Well, that in itself raises the obvious questions: why are these particular organisations exempt from the bill, and, in particular, how are you meant to raise objections against the government of the day if you can't criticise it for the information that it puts out?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole point of a democracy is, effectively, to protect free speech and protect people's rights to engage in conversation. It's also about accountability of the bureaucracy within that government. If you're not allowed to criticise the government, because they claim that this may be misinformation or disinformation, how are we meant to properly scrutinise the government? Of course, there are the usual qualifications in there which say you can't question the health advice. I've touched on that so many times I won't bother raising it again, but, long story short, we were banned on social media for saying that the COVID vaccine didn't stop transmission when, in actual fact, it didn't stop transmission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that really caught my eye over the weekend was the fact that you've got to be careful about criticising the banking sector and the financial markets. I'm absolutely intrigued as to how that little provision got in there, because the day you can't do a bit of bank bashing is the day that Australia loses its culture indeed. There's no more Australian a pastime than bashing the banks. I think we are pretty much on a 'uniticket' there. I know that, during the recent Senate RRAT inquiry, all the parties were into bashing the banks. So it's a crazy bill but definitely a great motion.</span>

Those are the six sectors that are best positioned to support Australia's transition to net zero emissions, but none of us should ignore what's happening around us, in Australia but also around the world, as this report is handed down.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report is being handed down as Australia records its hottest ever winter temperatures. Just three weeks ago Yampi Sound, in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, broke the previous national winter record when it reached 41.6 degrees. That is not just impacting on climate. It's not just impacting on ecological systems and processes that underpin that complex, beautiful web of life that exists on the planet. It's not just impacting on the health of all the places that we love so much—even some of the places we might not love so much. It's impacting on the health of people around the world. We're already seeing an increased number of deaths from climate related circumstances right around the world, including heat stress.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This report rightfully acknowledges that working to reduce emissions now is far more efficient and effective that waiting and hoping that bigger breakthroughs will do all the work, but we all know, in this place, what we need to do to rein in emissions. We all know that we need to stop approving new coal and gas mines. We all know that we need to stop logging our native forests. We know these things. This is not an issue where lack of knowledge is holding us back. This is an issue where lack of political will is holding us back.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we had more people in this place who were prepared to stand up and fight the big fossil fuel corporations, who were prepared to fight to defend nature and defend our native forests from the ongoing destruction that is enabled by the complicity of the establishment parties in this place, if we had more people who were willing to fight in this place and demand real climate action, we could actually do the things that need to be done to rein in our emissions and make sure we have a safe and livable planet, not just for humans but for all the myriad species that rely on our climate and our ecological processes.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you know the quickest, simplest way to get more people into this place who are prepared to do these things? Vote for the Greens. Put Greens in this place. We are not beholden to the big polluting corporations. We are here to defend nature. We are here to defend the complex, beautiful web of life that exists in our forests. We are here to rein in emissions. We will not be bought out by the political donations—the institutionalised bribery from the big corporations—as the major parties are. Just last week, the establishment parties in this place colluded to vote down Greens legislation to end the logging of native forests in Australia. Why did they do that? They did that because they are captive to the native forest logging industry, in the same way that they are captive to the fossil fuel corporations.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been in politics for over two decades and, for the entirety of my political career, I have watched Labor and Liberal get together to ensure the ongoing destruction of our forests. I have watched Labor and Liberal get together to facilitate the ongoing operations and the ongoing profits of big fossil fuel corporations. I know how this story goes.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:24</span>):  I too rise to take note of document No. 1, the Climate Change Authority's <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ector pathways review 2024</span>. The latest quarterly emissions data, horrifyingly, shows that emissions have risen 2½ per cent from December to March. That's even higher than it was in the final days of the Morrison government. Emissions are not coming down, and it's putting a safe climate out of reach. There were 438.4 million tonnes of emissions released in the year to June 2022—the last quarter of the Morrison government—and they sit at 440.2 million tonnes per annum in a quarterly report released with this CCA pathway review, which shows no real progress. In fact, it's higher. Emissions in electricity are up for the quarter and are worrying because increased energy demand was driven by living in a hotter climate. Modest changes to electricity emissions over the year, driven by renewables, is not enough to decarbonise. The government needs to drive out fossil fuels everywhere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor, more coal, oil and gas means more pollution. Labor has approved 23 new coal and gas projects since coming to office—23 new coal and gas projects when we are in a climate crisis and all of the science says that we need to be exiting out of fossil fuels and onto clean renewable energy as quickly as possible. But, no, you take the donations from the fossil fuel sector, and—hey presto!—out come the approvals for 23 new fossil fuel projects. It's no wonder that fugitive emissions from coal are up 0.8 per cent for the quarter. LNG exports have driven the largest sectoral increase in emissions, a tragic 23 per cent increase since 2005, and yet still the Albanese government pushes a future gas strategy beyond 2050. Transport emissions are continuing to rise rapidly, with a 2.6 per cent increase. Labor must do more to drive the uptake of electric vehicles and public transport, including more incentives, rapid-charging infrastructure and targets for the phase-out of new petrol cars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The figures in this report show that at the current rate there is no prospect of Australia cutting its pollution consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 or two degrees—the goals that were enshrined in the Paris Agreement. And even Labor's weak targets, which blow us out past two degrees, are under threat from stubbornly high gas pollution. Emissions would need to decline an average 14½ million tonnes a year to meet Labor's inadequate 2030 target, with the easiest and steepest cuts occurring right now. Instead, the data shows that emissions reductions have stalled since Labor came into office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To make these emissions figures worse, the Albanese government is seeking to expand coal and gas past 2050 as part of their Future Gas Strategy and their Future Made in Australia plans. Well, it's a future made for fossil fuels under this government, who said that they were going to take action on the climate crisis. And what have they done? Roll out the red carpet for the fossil fuel megacorporations, who, of course, make generous donations to their political party and to the opposition's political party. Perhaps that's why they've got 23 new approvals for coal and gas projects under this government, who said that they'd be different from the last.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is getting increasingly difficult to tell the difference between the two big parties in this place, and that is why support for both of your parties is on the wane. People wanted climate action. They acknowledge we're in a climate crisis. They can see the potential and the jobs creation in clean renewable energy. And yet you're on the take from the fossil fuel industry, and the confetti of approvals just continues. Meanwhile, the climate is cooking. We're losing jobs on the Great Barrier Reef. We're seeing agricultural productivity decline. And there are so many missed opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This report is tragic reading; it catalogues all of the failures and all of the broken promises from this government. This emissions data spells disaster. Emissions are not coming down, and your commitment to coal and gas will see Australia blow any chance of meeting safe climate targets. At this rate, you're not even going to meet your own unscientific climate target, let alone what's actually needed to tackle the climate crisis. Gas is as dirty as coal. Climate pollution from gas is rising. But, instead of cutting it, 23 coal and gas projects have been approved as part of Labor's Future Gas Strategy to run beyond 2050. For shame!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:29</span>):  I rise to contribute my thoughts in relation to the Climate Change Authority's <span style="font-style:italic;">Sector </span><span style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span style="font-style:italic;">athways </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eview </span><span style="font-style:italic;">2024</span> and, like Senator Waters, I am extremely disappointed. All the promises that were made by the Albanese government to take climate change seriously and to act seriously are becoming harder and harder to believe every time this government approves the opening of a new coalmine or gas mine. There have been 23 so far under this government, yet we know that, if we are to arrest dangerous global warming, we have to stop making the problem worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The International Energy Agency, the United Nations and every expert around the world—the scientists, the energy experts—are all telling governments like Australia's that you can't keep opening new coalmines and gas mines and you can't keep creating new fossil fuel industry if you want to stop global warming. You can't keep putting petrol on the fire. This is just unthinkable, frankly. We need to be reducing carbon pollution. We need to be reducing emissions, but emissions are higher than they were under the Morrison government. What? This is crazy! This is dangerous. This needs to be reversed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's as if the Albanese government is hoping everyone has forgotten the promises that were made at the last election. It's like the Prime Minister is hoping that no-one has noticed that, despite promises that they would do better on climate and the environment, the government is dropping the ball, seemingly dragging its feet and making things worse. It is just unacceptable in 2024, when we are having record temperatures here in Australia and around the world, that this government is approving new coalmines and gas mines and that the environment minister is signing off on new coalmines and gas mines and giving them a big green tick. There's nothing green about new coal and gas. There is nothing environmentally sound about expanding the fossil fuel industry in 2024. There is nothing that supports the idea that a government can just make the situation worse and expand fossil fuels. It is the exact opposite of what science requires.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last election, more candidates with a climate and environment policy were voted into this parliament for the first time than ever before—across the crossbench and across the Greens, and there were even some on the Labor Party benches. The government had a mandate—the parliament has a mandate—to do more, not less. Instead of doing more, the Prime Minister today has told the parliament to get out of his way so that he can continue to sign off on the opening of new coalmines and gas mines. He doesn't want any type of climate assessment in environment law. The Prime Minister has told the parliament to get out of his way so he can keep letting the gas industry, the coal industry and other big polluters open up, keep going, keep burning and keep polluting. It's simply unacceptable, and it needs to be called out.</span>

Remember two years ago, when we legislated a 43 per cent emissions reduction target, equivalent to a two-degree warming from preindustrial levels, significantly below the ambition of the Paris Agreement? The government kept saying: 'That's the floor. We intend to do a lot better. You watch. We're going to bring in policies and fund initiatives to reduce emissions across other sectoral pathways.' Well, here before us, in the Climate Change Authority report, we have a plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to highlight one of those pathways in particular, which is the circular economy. This is an issue that all Australians care about. It might be at home—what they put in their bin that goes kerbside. No-one wants to see a mountain of waste. Everybody wants to see more recycling. Everybody wants to see taken out of our waste stream problematic, single-use plastics that are made from petroleum. Everybody wants to see big producers of plastic pollution, big retailers of plastic pollution, like Coles and Woolies, and food manufacturers that use plastic take responsibility for the products that they sell and put out into the marketplace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Have you noticed over the decades how the industry has really cleverly put it back onto consumers to 'do the right thing', 'put it in the bin' and go through kerbside recycling? Guess what? That's not working. Every day we get more and more waste—more and more waste going to landfill and more and more litter leaking into our rivers, our streams and our oceans. We've got plastic all through our food chain. We've got plastic all through our human bodies, including in our brains, according to the latest research. It should be—pardon the pun—a no-brainer to act on plastic pollution. And here we have the Climate Change Authority saying to us, 'Here is a pathway to build a circular economy.' But you know what? That's going to take a bit of courage. That's going to take a bit of leadership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a Senate inquiry before us right now that's looking at where the government is at with building a circular economy. They've talked a big game since they came to government, saying that they were going to step in and regulate the packaging industry. Let's be honest; packaging is a big, big source of our problem. Did you know that plastic production just on its own is 45 per cent of the petrochemical sector around the world, which is projected to account for a third of the growth in oil demand by 2025? That's the demand for oil and gas exploration at one end, leading through to the production of plastic, with our rampant consumption of this kind of packaging. So we're supporting more oil and gas exploration, it's worse for the climate, it's increasing emissions, and we know what we can do about it—that is, actually tell these companies, 'You can't sell anything that can't be recycled, reused, composted or refused.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seriously, why are we letting these companies get away with producing so much rubbish that is just so damaging to our environment but also, as we're discussing here today, is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions? It's no wonder multinational oil and gas corporations are eyeing a rapid expansion in the production of plastics to generate the demand for fossil fuels in a decarbonised world. They will get away with it if we don't do something about it, and here before us is some advice for that sectoral pathway in the waste and recycling industry—what we need to do. So I'd ask senators to read the report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's our job to put pressure on the government to make sure we lift our ambitions in this place. A 43 per cent emissions reduction target by 2035 is not ambitious. It was sold to us at the time by the government as being a start, and I have yet to see the action in other sectors to reduce emissions. We know the most recent data on emissions is that they are continuing to rise here in Australia. Meanwhile, the planet continues to warm, and we don't take the action that is necessary. Is that because we refuse to stand up to big corporations? Yes, it is. On this particular issue with waste, Australians want to see action. No matter what their political colour, no matter where they live, they want us to do the right thing and build a circular economy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  I too rise to take note of document No. 1, the Climate Change Authority's <span style="font-style:italic;">Sector </span><span style="font-style:italic;">pathways review</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> 2024</span><span style="font-style:italic;">.</span> The report considers the emissions pathways for six sectors, including electricity and energy, and what is required for Australia's transition to net zero emissions. As this review states, every sector of the economy must play its part in the transition to net zero emissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the transition to net zero, we must not forget the workers and the communities that have powered the country. We owe coal workers a debt of thanks for powering our country. We don't need to choose between taking urgent climate action and supporting coal communities. We can do both. Where I live in Central Queensland, coal and gas workers tell me that they know their jobs are on the way out and that they're sick of governments pretending it isn't happening. They want honesty and they want a plan. There is so much opportunity in the coal regions, but we really need to get on with it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unions, workers and communities have been campaigning for this for a long time, and it's long overdue to have a plan in place for these workers, who are going to be hit hard. The Greens went to the last election as the only party pushing for a statutory authority to support coal and gas workers. The Liberals kept their head in the sand, and the Labor Party were too timid to include it in their Powering Australia plan. During discussions with the government on the climate change bill, the Greens pushed for an independent statutory authority to look after coal and gas communities as the world transitions. The Net Zero Economy Authority Bill, which passed this place recently, explicitly relates to employees of coal- and gas-fired power stations and coalmines. However, the legislation does not make mention of gas and oil extraction, reflecting the federal government's broader reluctance to constrain an active policy support for the expansion of Australian LNG exports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a trend with this government of announcing a piecemeal, underwhelming legislative or policy effort with regard to climate change or the environment and immediately following it up with plans for further expansion of the gas industry. Labor's Future Gas Strategy locks us into gas past 2050. It shows that they are a party fundamentally unserious about reducing emissions, fundamentally unserious about acting on climate change and fundamentally comfortable with condemning Australia to even more bushfires, droughts, floods and killer heatwaves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's industrial history is littered with moments in time when communities faced rapid and unprecedented changes, a moment of deindustrialisation or of boom and bust. Many of these moments demonstrate how poorly the transition has gone for workers and the communities that they live in. There is immense opportunity for the government to engage in community building. Governments don't make communities, but assistance schemes can provide the basis for stability, longevity and ultimately self-determination and freedom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's hard to overstate the importance of getting this right for communities like mine in Gladstone. Industry transition in the face of global and national trends toward a net zero economy has incredibly visceral local impacts—impacts on neighbours; on families; on children; and on the supporting community of people and professions that make up our cities and towns, essential workers like teachers, nurses and aged-care workers. The shape and feel of our communities are affected. The global trade winds that blow into town and bring with them jobs and localised employment just as quickly drift away and take the promised prosperity with them. This has been the history of industrialisation, and for so long we have struggled to find a better way, not because we didn't have ideas of how to do better. Communities and workers have called for just and fair transitions for decades. No, they have been callous actions by governments and industry that have left workers behind and decimated communities. This is the fear that communities like mine face. It's why we must get organised and fight for a fair and just transition—because no coal worker should suffer the anxiety and financial insecurity that comes from losing their job suddenly. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:45</span>):  I rise to take note of the Climate Change Authority's <span style="font-style:italic;">Sector </span><span style="font-style:italic;">pathways review 2024</span> and add my support to the comments of the colleagues who have gone before me. This review considered the pathways for six sectors—agriculture and land, built environment, electricity and energy, industry and waste, and transport and resources—to decarbonise. The review found that there are many pathways to achieve emissions reduction, with existing, mature technologies such as solar and wind for electricity generation and batteries for energy storage getting Australia much of the way to net zero. Opportunities also exist with the rapid development of emerging low-emissions technologies such as hydrogen and engineered carbon removals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While this review is encouraging, I do not have hope that the Labor government will act on its findings. Since Labor have been in government, we have seen them continue to approve new coal and gas mines. We have seen them attempt to water down proposed environmental legislation and dodge any responsibility for this climate crisis. We are in the midst of a climate emergency. Without an urgent reduction in our carbon emissions, we risk catastrophe. To do nothing is to risk everything. You only need to be reminded of that when bushfire survivors for climate action come through your office and tell you about losing everything, from their homes and their livelihoods to their friends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, the Labor government released its Future Gas Strategy, where it talked up the crucial role of gas through to and beyond 2050. What kind of a sick joke is this? And then, on forests, the report highlights the importance of protecting forests as vital carbon sinks. Australia's native forests are unique and beautiful and home to some of our most iconic wildlife. They are unceded country for traditional owners, with precious totems and songlines woven through them. Despite that, Labor and Liberal governments have permitted and overseen decades of native forest logging that destroys our environment and releases over 11 million tonnes of carbon each year. Any path to decarbonisation must include an end to native forest logging.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch on an issue close to my heart in this discussion around decarbonisation, which is the Pacific islands. I recently had the opportunity to join a climate focused parliamentary delegation, with Save the Children, to Vanuatu. The delegation travelled through the country. We met with families, communities and village chiefs to learn about some of the positive impacts of Australia's financial aid, but, more importantly, the climate catastrophe and the impact it has on their ability to sustain their livelihoods and continue to stay on the land where they have lived for generations and generations. They spoke about the immense grief they're experiencing in already having to move away from areas and in losing the language, culture and traditions that their ancestors have passed on to them for generations. We visited a hospital where water is now lapping at the doorstep because of rising sea levels. What the government describes as our Pacific family is astounded that, in the face of this climate ruin and of them being designated climate refugees from their own countries, our government is approving new coal and gas projects and fuelling the fire, the floods, the storm surges and the sea level rise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I ask: when will the Labor government learn that new coal and gas projects are a pathway to environmental collapse? When will the Labor government learn that doing deals with the coalition to weaken our national environmental laws is exactly the opposite of what is needed to avoid mass extinction? When will it learn that, unless it starts to show leadership on climate and biodiversity protection to rule out new coal and gas projects, protect our forests and create a pathway to a hundred per cent clean and renewable energy, it is doomed to career towards electoral oblivion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The time for climate action is now. The time for climate leadership is now. No more weasel words, no more faux outrage from backbenchers fighting for their political lives—it is time for true, meaningful climate action: an end to coal and gas, an end to native forest logging and giving us a bit of hope that future generations can live and raise families on a safe planet.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  I rise to speak on the document produced in response to order for the production of documents No. 200. This order relates to the MRH-90 Taipan helicopter crash in Jervis Bay in May 2023. The helicopter with the call sign Bushman 82 was hovering low above the water on a training exercise, with divers suspended below, when it experienced a catastrophic failure of its left-hand engine. The helicopter ditched into the water—in a stroke of luck, without any fatalities. Just one month later, Defence gave the MRH-90 helicopter a completely clean bill of health and authorised it to continue flying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate agreed to this OPD in May 2023, requiring Defence to hand over any safety reports and documents in relation to the crash. We wanted to know how Defence had certified the helicopter as safe so quickly after such a significant incident. In defiance of the order of this Senate, the Minister for Defence refused to hand over any documents, citing an ongoing internal investigation, despite the helicopter already being back in the air, threatening lives. The government and Defence advised that that investigation should conclude in October 2023.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In June 2023, a month after, the Senate reiterated its order for the documents in motion 243, with a new deadline of November in accordance with the advice of the government. We gave them a go. They failed to produce even a response to that order until the Senate sought an explanation in December of 2023. We can see how time marches on and is irrelevant to Defence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we fast forward to September 2024, 18 months after the crash and nearly a year after the government promised to respond. We finally have a response and documents, yet it is not a compliant response. It's a redacted version of an executive summary to a single report. The order very clearly specified 'all incident reports, safety evaluations, briefing notes, correspondence and information held by the Department of Defence, the defence minister or the defence minister's office'. The executive summary to one report clearly doesn't satisfy this request.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, where are your briefing notes? Where is your correspondence? Are you telling the Senate that you and your office had nothing to say about the Jervis Bay ditching? The executive summary is dated 2 August 2024. That's three months and two weeks ago. Did Defence sit on this report before giving it to the minister? Why the delay? The six pages of redacted executive summary we do have are from the Defence Flight Safety Bureau's aviation safety investigation report. From what we do have, a few things are clear:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The engine failure was caused by the rupture of Blade 34 from the High Pressure 1 (HP1) wheel in the High Pressure Turbine (HPT).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They know the cause. Another quote reads:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… in 2017, as a result of several HP1 failures across the global fleet, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) issued a NH90 Service Bulletin  recommending that operators … replace HP 1 blades with modified blades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another quote reads:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The investigation highlighted that there was no definitive evidence of the completion and recording of hazard analysis and safety risk assessments related to HP 1 failures during MRH-90 PCS operations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence decided to keep flying the helicopters without the modified parts and eventually get around to it while failing to consider and document the risk that these things would lose an engine during low-level flight because of this. In 2023, five years after the bulletin was given to Defence, Bushman 82 was still flying in Jervis Bay without the recommended modified parts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report, while not compliant with the Senate's order, is important because it again demonstrates Defence was willing to overlook serious risks when it came to this helicopter—risks involving lives. How many other problems with the MRH-90 helicopter did Defence overlook? How many times did they allow this thing back in the air, knowing it would unnecessarily put our defence personnel at needless risk? How many potentially catastrophic issues, like the TopOwl headset, were supposedly mitigated? How many did Defence just explain away?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These documents are important because this helicopter should have been pulled from service a decade ago. The MRH-90 should have been permanently grounded after Bushman 80 ditched into Jervis Bay—the latest, at the time, of a series of incidents. It wasn't pulled from service, and, four months later, Bushman 83 crashed in the Whitsundays, resulting in the death of four personnel: Warrant Officer Class 2 Joseph Phillip Laycock—Phil, as he was known; troop commander Captain Danniel Lyon; Lieutenant Maxwell Nugent; and Corporal Alexander Naggs. May they rest in peace. Blood is on the hands of the defence leadership and successive defence ministers who kept this helicopter in the air when it belonged on the ground. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:56</span>):  I take note of the government's response to order for the production of documents No. 592, which relates to visas issued to Palestinians. We know why the opposition is pursuing this, and that's because the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Dutton, and his colleagues in the Liberal and National parties intend to make race a central theme of their election campaign. Of course, that is going to be extremely harmful and hurtful to millions of Australians who identify as something other than Anglo, who have black or brown skin, who come from non-Anglo cultures. It's going to be a really difficult 12 months for those people, because, whether or not they're ready for it—and many of them aren't—this is going to be an election campaign where the opposition parties seek to place race and culture at the centre of their campaign.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are going to see is more of this manufactured outrage that we've seen from Mr Dutton. For example, he raised the issue of these so-called Sudanese gangs who were, apparently, according to him, prowling the streets of Melbourne, making it unsafe for people to go out for dinner. Even when Victoria Police came out and said, 'There are no Sudanese gangs in Melbourne,' that didn't dissuade Mr Dutton from his harmful and hurtful race based agenda. Of course, we know what Mr Dutton has built political career on. He has built his political career on demonising people from other cultures and people with non-white skin colours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I made visits to Manus Island, and I acknowledge my friend and colleague Senator Hanson-Young here, who visited Nauru. Both of us went over there to have a look at the offshore prisons that Australia established in Papua New Guinea and Nauru. I know from my observations in the Lombrum detention centre on Manus Island how many white-skinned people there were incarcerated over there: absolutely none. That was, in effect, a racist detention system established by the opposition, contrary to our commitments to the refugee convention, which we were and are a signatory to, because of course that convention does not permit signatories to discriminate against people based on their mode of arrival in a country. Of course, what Australia's laws did and still do, shamefully, is discriminate against people based on the fact that they arrived here by boat, not my plane—a clear contravention of the refugee convention. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This order for the production of documents relates to advice provided by the Department of Home Affairs to the former Minister for Home Affairs, Ms O'Neil, and the former Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Giles, relating to the issuance of visas to Palestinians in response to the Israel-Hamas conflict. I just want to say a few words about what is actually going on in Gaza at the moment. The Gaza ministry of health has just released a 649-page report, and that report has the name, age, gender and ID number of every Palestinian killed in Gaza from 7 October to 31 August this year. Brace yourselves, colleagues, because I'm going to tell you something really tragic and so profoundly distressing. The first 14 pages of that report are people between the ages of zero and one who are dead. The first 14 pages are the babies who've been slaughtered by the government of the State of Israel. They are the innocents who are dead in a genocide. There are 14 pages of them—their names, their ages, their ID numbers—tiny children who never even made it to their first birthday because of a genocide that Australia is complicit in, that Labor is complicit in. That is because we are still exporting weapons components to the State of Israel, including a weapons component that actually opens the bomb doors on the F35 jets that are dropping the bombs that are killing these babies. How does it feel to be complicit in a genocide? That's a question that Labor needs to ask itself. It's also a question that the opposition needs to ask itself. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember that motion that came into this place shortly after October 7 last year that still remains—the motion that said, 'We stand with Israel,' the motion that the Australian Greens tried to amend to take out those words but were unsuccessful at doing so. 'We stand with Israel,' says that motion. We didn't support that motion because we didn't stand with Israel then, and we don't stand with Israel now. But the Labor and Liberal parties do. I say to them: How can you continue to be complicit in a genocide that has slaughtered tens of thousands of people? How can you be complicit in a genocide that has killed 14 pages worth of babies who never made it to their first birthday? How can you be complicit by providing weapons components and military components to the government that is carrying out a genocide like we're seeing in Gaza? It is profoundly distressing. It is utterly, utterly tragic. And here we are today. The Greens have fought for this parliament to take a more balanced position. We have fought for the government to end its complicity in this genocide. We have fought for Labor to cancel those export permits that relate to military hardware that's being used by the State of Israel in a genocide. And we'll keep fighting. Don't worry about that; we will keep fighting for those things. But the Australian people need to understand that, when the two establishment political groupings in this place get together and share complicity in a genocide, and when the two establishment political parties just become harder and harder to tell apart on this issue and a range of other issues, change is possible in a democracy, but you can't keep voting for the same old rubbish and expect to get something different.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want change, you have to vote for it. If you want to put people in this place who will fight against a genocide, as the Australian Greens have done and are doing and will continue to do, you've got to vote for us to get in here, because voting for the establishment parties is just going to deliver more of the same. It's going to deliver more motions through this place that say that, collectively, we stand with Israel, when in fact the Australian Greens did not at the time and have not done between then and us having this debate—and we're still not going to stand with Israel until they end the genocide and end the illegal occupation. Those are the things that the Australian Greens stand for. We stand for an end to the tragic, awful, profoundly distressing genocide in Gaza.</span>

                    </a>  I withdraw. Of course, the request for these documents came from the Dutton coalition because the Dutton coalition are interested in trying to whip up as much fear and hatred as they possibly can in the lead-up to the election. And why? Why? Because they've got nothing else going for them. They've got nothing else going for them. When you don't have any positive ideas and you can't deal with all the mess internally in your own state and territory branches, what do you do? You race-bait. That is why the Dutton coalition continue to try and whip up hate and fear in relation to refugee visas here in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Peter Dutton has not put forward any positive plan about what his government would do if he were to win the election. All Peter Dutton does is drag people down, whip up fear and throw mud—and there's nothing like a little bit of dog whistling and race-baiting. Peter Dutton reverts to type every single time. That's why these documents were asked for, not because the opposition actually care about the details. They use it as an opportunity to whip up fear, hatred and race-baiting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, none of this is new. This is what the coalition do election after election. And none of it is particularly original either. It's not just here in Australia that the rabid right-wing thugs like to whip up fear and hatred of migrants and refugees. It's happening at the moment in the US, in the US election. It won't be long before we have Peter Dutton telling people to lock up their pets. This is the level of stupidity. This is the level of nastiness that comes from the Dutton coalition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all might have a little chuckle at how ludicrous and stupid these points of debate are in the United States from Donald Trump, but you watch—as we get closer and closer to the election, and Peter Dutton is desperate for power, desperate to sow those seeds of hatred and fear in the community, he will start to use those Donald Trump lines. And there will be several on the crossbench here, over on the right-wing corner, who will start using them as well, because they can't think for themselves. They've got no originality. All of this stuff is just imported from the US. They use the same memes; they just put a different head on. That's the thing about people who race-bait—they're not very original. They've been doing it for generations. It's the same old, tired arguments, and it degrades all of us. It degrades the culture and the national spirit of our country. We are a proud multicultural society. Our country is made up of people from all parts of the world, and most of us are proud of it, but not if you're a rabid right-winger wanting to win power, because that's all they've got. And Peter Dutton will revert to type over and over again in the lead-up to this election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge the Labor Party: don't get fooled by the nasty politics of the nasty party. Don't get dragged down into the gutter with them. Don't get dragged into the gutter by the nasty party. Stand up for what makes our nation great, and it is being an inclusive, compassionate multicultural society, one of the most successful in the world. Don't get dragged down into the gutter by Peter Dutton and the nasty party. Don't think you have to match in this race-baiting race.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Peter Dutton gets pretty upset when people call this out. He's got one of the most fragile glass jaws of all. He's thin skinned and can't take it. He can dish it out to everybody else, but he can never actually stand the heat when it comes directly to him. You watch—this election is going to be pretty horrible, because the only thing that Peter Dutton has going for him is being nasty, dirty and thuggish. That's the only thing that this opposition have going for them, and they won't even come up with it themselves. They will borrow the memes, the lines and the vibe from Donald Trump. Australia is not the United States. We don't need a Donald Trump here. We need leadership that is transparent, that has integrity, that cares about people and that deals with the real struggles that people are facing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason Peter Dutton talks about the fear of migrants and blames migrants for everything is that he does not have a plan for tackling the cost of living. He doesn't have a plan for dealing with the price gouging of our supermarkets. He doesn't have a plan to deal with housing affordability. He doesn't want to talk about that stuff. He wants to blame migrants and refugees for everything because he's lazy. It's lazy politics. It's nasty politics. It belongs in the gutter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge the Labor Party: don't get tricked, and don't fall into the trap of thinking you have to be in a race with him to the bottom. We've seen it happen before and we don't need to see it again. We know how this story goes. Show some spine, show some courage and stare the nasty party down. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="296215" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COX</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:16</span>):  I rise to make a contribution to the motion to take note of the response to order for the production of documents 601, on the McPhillamys Gold Project, and the statement of reasons. Again we see this come back, yet it's under another name. Every day we turn around and there's another name. There's the McPhillamys gold mine. Last week was the disallowance motion around the declaration on the Belubula River of Kings Plain. We always have a new name for it. But the name that should be put to this is why the opposition are going on a witch hunt to look for the statement of reasons for why the environment minister has made a ruling under section 10 to protect Aboriginal cultural heritage in this country. She has made, for once, a decent decision to protect country—to protect the freshwater area at the headwaters of this river in New South Wales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My colleague Senator Shoebridge, who is also here tonight in the chamber, made a contribution to the debate on the disallowance motion last week and spoke very clearly about the New South Wales land council act, under which people are claiming they have the cultural authority to speak. It will be no surprise to those here in this chamber tonight that not all blackfellas agree. There are people sitting on opposite sides of this chamber and here on the crossbench who all have different opinions and have all had different experiences. That is why we can't go on a witch-hunt looking for a statement of reasons. The reasons are clear. If you are to talk to the traditional owners and not use them to discredit each other, attack each other and defame each other about the true Aboriginal cultural heritage that exists in this area, you must sit and listen. The environment minister has done that. Minister Plibersek, from the other place, has done that. She has done her due diligence in asking for what the dreaming story, the creation story—men, women's and everyone's story—is for this area. There is history of this recording of another section 10.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But in question time last week the opposition came in. The coalition and most of the crossbench had been put up to this. They came here with questions about why this decision was made. It's like a broken record. You need to let this go. This is about a tailings dam. It is not about McPhillamys gold mine being stopped. You are gaslighting everyone by saying that. It is about the tailings dam, which can be moved. Everyone in this place is just so outraged that this has happened to the poor Regis Resources goldmining company from Perth. They're not even from the east coast. They're from my home state. And yet Juukan Gorge happened to the PKKP people. There was international outrage about what Rio Tinto did, and everyone in this place went: 'Oh, jeez! A mining company does that, blows up some caves, and tries to destroy Aboriginal cultural heritage.' I sat on that committee and listened to the traditional owners and those around this country that are constantly fighting for land and sea country—constantly—because none of this is being identified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister McAllister is here tonight. She knows that I will get up at every Senate estimates and ask the same question: where is our Aboriginal cultural heritage standalone legislation? I'm sure she gets sick of me asking that question, because I am not letting that go. I am not letting go of the fact that this government agreed to have standalone cultural heritage legislation and to strengthen our environment laws and it has done neither. In fact, we have the Prime Minister today skipping to the tune of the Western Australian government and the big gas corporations in my home state of Western Australia, saying, 'We will follow their lead.' Whatever they write, this government will skip to their tune.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Protecting cultural heritage is everybody's responsibility in this country. It is the first chapter of the story of this country. When I brought to this parliament the Truth and Justice Commission Bill 2024, that was what we sought to record—the first chapter. The second chapter is about the colonial story. The third chapter is about the multicultural society that we live in and should be proud of. As Senator Hanson-Young said before, the continued race baiting, dividing and dog whistling that is happening about race in this country must stop. It must stop now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we go to an election, we must reflect on where we've come since last year. This time last year, we were looking at a referendum where we would recognise First Nations people as the first peoples of this country. First Nations people are saying, 'We want to continue this journey with truth-telling, and we want to continue this journey to get a treaty in this country.' We over here in the Australian Greens will continue to pursue that, and that is my job as the First Nations portfolio holder, along with making sure that the resources companies in this country absolutely put free, prior and informed consent front and centre and absolutely make sure that their monitoring and surveys of heritage are done properly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As for the review that this government is doing on native title, I look forward to seeing how that detaches and decouples heritage from existing native title laws, because that's where the problem is. We get to identify, and we continue to have to call on the legal systems in this country to prove who we are and prove that sovereignty was never ceded in this country but that it was part of an invasion process. Colonialism still continues today. As long as the environment laws which house the laws for Aboriginal cultural heritage in this country remain rigged in favour of developers and resources companies, we will never get ahead. We will continue to have High Court challenges. We will continue to have inquiries on this, because those laws need to be fixed. They need to be fixed to be consistent with the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. That's why we have it. That's why we signed up to it. But we still haven't ratified it, because this government refused to. They refused to hold the inquiry that was put forward by Senator Thorpe about ratifying that document, enshrining it into Australian law and adhering to it. Until we actually get that, it's lip service that we get in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Activists continue to stand on the front line to protect country, defend country and hold close the stories that they have, which have been passed down to them for many, many generations. You might sit over on the opposite side or even on this side of the benches and think to yourself, 'Well, they're all just made up.' I've heard that more than once. People on Sky News and in the Murdoch press want to come out and say that things are made up. You might not have had that experience. You might not have been told that. It doesn't mean it's made up; it means you don't know about it. So how about you get out in the community and go and speak to the people who can tell you the statement of reasons that the opposition are wanting in this OPD?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They're looking for this wonderful gold gem that they're panning for. It's like panning for gold. That's what they want to do. They want to find that one little nugget that's going to give them a sense of hope that they can continue to race-bait and divide people in this country. It's not going to happen, because he people who claim that they have the cultural authority in this country don't. Under the New South Wales land act, a landholder, by accident, can be a traditional owner. It is not native title. It is not the federal process. So using that as your baton is not going to work. You can pass that down the line all you want and try and pass that off as some level of cultural authority. The hide of people sitting on those opposition benches coming in here and saying, 'Let's listen to the land council'—what, because that's convenient for you, you're trying to use that now? Last week we were in here voting on a land council inquiry to bring them all round the front and ask them questions because that's what you wanted to do. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="169119" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHOEBRIDGE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:26</span>):  I rise to speak to the UNRWA funding document that has been tabled. I would have liked to contribute on the Palestinian visas matter, but I understand the ruling. This document tabled in relation to the UNRWA funding agreement has come in the context of some fairly appalling politics, both globally and within Australia, in relation to UNRWA funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Astoundingly, on the basis of unverified allegations from the State of Israel, the Albanese Labor government cut funding to UNRWA entirely following the outbreak of the appalling war in Gaza. We found out in the days and weeks that followed the cutting of UNRWA funding that the foreign minister, Senator Wong, had decided to cut UNRWA funding on the basis of mere allegations, which had been reported largely in the media, of UNRWA staff and officials somehow colluding with or working for Hamas. Anyone who's followed Israel's attack on UNRWA over the last decades would have heard these repeated allegations from increasingly right-wing Israeli governments that have been aggressively trying to shut down UNRWA, which is an absolutely essential lifeline for the people of occupied Palestine, as well as for those refugees in countries that surround Palestine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Without UNRWA, Palestinian people would starve. Without UNRWA, there would be no schools and no education for millions of Palestinians. That is a fundamental fact. As I said, it has now been a project of increasingly extremist governments in Israel to shut down UNRWA as part of the ongoing attack against the Palestinian people. If that were ever permitted to happen, it would mean that the schools would permanently be shut and that the food supplies, the medical supplies and the essential support to keep Palestinian people alive would be shut down. This awful political project, from successive Israeli governments, was given a boost by the Albanese Labor government when they uncritically accepted these allegations from Israel about UNRWA officials and employees having connections with Hamas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, the funding having been cut—that lifeline to millions of Palestinians—we got close to radio silence from the Albanese Labor government. They refused to explain what information they had relied upon or to articulate what they understood to be the evidence supporting their decision. As pressure was applied to not just the Australian government, which had cut funding, but European governments, the UK government and the US government, which had also cut funding, it became increasingly apparent that absolutely no evidence had ever been provided to the Australian government or to other governments to back the political attack that had come from the State of Israel. Indeed, investigations that have happened before now about these unsubstantiated allegations by Israel have repeatedly found them to be false allegations, weaponising a narrow subset of global opinion against UNRWA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my travel to Israel and Palestine and in my travel into the occupied West Bank in 2016, I had the privilege of visiting the UNRWA offices. I heard firsthand about the incredible struggles they were facing back then to just do their job and provide schools, food and essential support for the people of Palestine. The repeated, unsubstantiated allegations that were coming from Israel at that point, some eight years ago, and the repeated administrative, border and military barriers that were being put in front of UNRWA, when what it wanted to do was educate Palestinian kids, feed kids that didn't otherwise have a meal, and provide food aid and essential medical support for Palestinian people who had had their economic future shut down by an illegal occupation of their country and their homeland—all of that was apparent to anybody who was willing to look in 2016.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was even more apparent in 2023 and 2024, once this appalling conflict had started. And what did the Albanese government do? Without asking for evidence, without testing the assertions, without caring what the impact would be on the people of occupied Palestine, they just cut UNRWA funding. They followed the US like a polite little puppy dog, following the US in the attack against UNRWA, because that's what the extremist Netanyahu government had been demanding of them. You could not see a worse abandonment of principle. It was an abandonment of the Palestinian people at a time when they were more desperate than ever and more in need of the UNRWA's services than ever, when they were facing the bombing and the violence and the further repression in Gaza. The Albanese government walked away from them, without evidence, because it was politically convenient at the time. It was appalling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, months and months later, when the lack of evidence was apparent and other countries were finally moving to reinstate UNRWA funding, the Minister for Foreign Affairs came in and wanted us to celebrate and thank her for restoring the modest amount of funding that had been put in place, an amount of funding that was no larger than what had been given under Dutton's leadership. It was exactly the same as the coalition was giving. They restored funding that should never have been cut, and I still remember Foreign Minister Wong coming in here and suggesting that somehow or other the Greens and the Palestinian diaspora and the broader community should be grateful because Labor restored funding back to what it had been under Morrison and Dutton and co.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was hard to stomach at the time, but it's part of a pattern where the basic political direction of the Albanese government on this appalling conflict in Gaza has been directed either by the United States' foreign policy settings or by an ugly fearmongering political campaign that has come from Mr Peter Dutton and his team. It has been one or the other that has been leading the Albanese government in their response, and it was a combination that got them to cravenly cut UNRWA funding without evidence, knowing, as they did, the history, knowing the repeated disingenuous attacks that the increasingly radical right-wing Israeli governments have been making against UNRWA, and knowing full well, as the foreign minister must have known, that, when you take funding from UNRWA, you're taking education from Palestinian kids and you're taking food from the tables of Palestinians who have no other way to support themselves because of the illegal occupation. It was shameful then. It remains shameful now.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Naval Nuclear Power Safety Bill 2024<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>makes clear the activities that are to be regulated. There are three types of regulated activities:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(1) Facility activities—that relate to particular facilities in Australia that are relevant to AUKUS submarines; </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(2) Submarine activities—that relate to AUKUS submarines themselves; and </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(3) Material activities—that relate to certain material, equipment and plant that emit or produce radiation and is from, or is for use on, AUKUS submarines. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While 'regulated activities' are relevant to AUKUS submarines, this Bill would not apply to conduct on board UK and US submarines. The focus of this Bill is on regulating activities associated with facilities in Australia that will be supporting Australian, UK and US submarines and eventually Australia's own conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under this Bill, regulated activities can only occur within 'designated zones' in Australia or in relation to Australia's conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines, wherever they are located. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is necessary for zones to be designated so that it will be clear where the boundaries lie between Australia's existing civil nuclear safety framework, established by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998</span>,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>and the new arrangements under this Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Two zones will be designated initially, one at HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Stirling</span> in Western Australia and another at the Osborne Naval Shipyard in South Australia. The limits of those zones will be prescribed in regulations that will be made after the commencement of this Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In response to the Senate Committee's Inquiry Report, the Government has amended the Bill to require the Minister for Defence to consult on the boundary of any future designated zones before regulations may be made or amended, prescribing that designated zone. This would not apply to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Osborne designated zone</span> or the <span style="font-style:italic;">Stirling designated zone</span>. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The consultation requirements at subsection 143(2) are not intended to be exhaustive or constrain the Minister for Defence from undertaking any other consultation or notification activities the Minister may consider necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government has been clear that Australia will only be responsible for managing its own spent nuclear fuel, which isn't expected to occur until the 2050s, the Bill puts beyond doubt that Australia will not store or dispose of spent nuclear fuel from non-Australian submarines, including US or UK submarines. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under this Bill, there are to be nuclear safety duties that apply to people when they undertake a regulated activity. It is necessary to impose duties on persons undertaking regulated activities because it is those persons who bear prime responsibility for nuclear safety. For example, a person must ensure nuclear safety so far as reasonably practicable, and must be authorised by a licence. A person who is a licence holder must also establish, implement and maintain a nuclear safety management system to ensure nuclear safety. A licence holder would also be required to report nuclear safety incidents and to ensure that persons who are authorised by a licence have the appropriate expertise, training and information to ensure nuclear safety. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under this Bill, a person must comply with the conditions of a licence. Work is underway to develop regulations that would, amongst other things, specify the conditions applicable to particular licences that would be required. The regulations will draw on Australia's experience in ensuring civil nuclear safety and relevant international best practice—which includes the International Atomic Energy Agency—as well as the measures applied by the United States and the United Kingdom. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the primary purpose of the Bill is the promotion of the nuclear safety of activities relating to AUKUS submarines, it is necessary to establish a range of significant civil and criminal penalties for contraventions and offences—including breaches of licence conditions and contraventions of nuclear safety duties. These have been benchmarked against other offences in the Commonwealth statute book, and certain penalties contained in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Act 2023</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will also establish a new independent regulator, the Australian Naval Nuclear Power Safety Regulator. This new Regulator would work with existing regulators to promote the safety of our submariners, Australian and international communities, and the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Regulator would have a range of functions, including considering applications for licences that would authorise regulated activities. The Regulator would only issue a licence where it is satisfied the statutory criteria are met, including that the applicant will be able to comply with the conditions of a licence.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The powers of the Regulator and its inspectors are comprehensive and are first directed towards promoting nuclear safety. The powers include entering monitoring and investigation areas, conducting searches, operating equipment, and securing or seizing evidence. Inspectors may also give directions, improvement and prohibition notices, and make certain requirements of persons. </span>

The new requirement provides that a person must not be appointed as, or remain, the Director-General or Deputy Director-General of the Regulator if they served at any time in the previous 12 months as a staff member of Defence or the Australian Submarine Agency. This strengthens the independence of the Regulator by ensuring an appropriate separation period from any service in the Australian Defence Force or Australian Public Service employment in the Department of Defence or the Australian Submarine Agency.</span>

The Bill has been amended to insert a new definition of 'Defence staff member' to include ADF service chiefs, ADF members, APS employees of the Department of Defence and Australian Submarine Agency, in addition to the Secretary of the Department and the Head of the Australian Submarine Agency. This is an additional measure that will ensure the independence of the new Regulator. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill provides the Minister with a power to give the Regulator a direction about the performance of its functions and the exercise of relevant powers. This power would only be exercisable in exceptional circumstances, where the Minister is satisfied that it is necessary to give the direction to the Regulator in the interest of national security and to deal with an emergency. Should the power be exercised, the Bill would require that the Minister must table, in each House of Parliament, a statement that such direction was given to the Regulator.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">First, by establishing a new Governance Board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will be comprised of the Governor, Deputy Governor, Chief Operating Officer and 6 external members, and it will strengthen oversight and management of the bank to better manage risk and drive necessary change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It will have no role in the Bank's monetary, financial stability or payments policy.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government intends to appoint the RBA Governor as the inaugural Chair of the Governance Board, to ensure continuity as we implement these changes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">But the Bill allows any member of the Governance Board to be appointed chair, ensuring flexibility for future governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Second, the Governance Board will replace the Governor as the Reserve Bank's accountability authority, so a board, rather than an individual has collective responsibility for corporate governance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Bringing the RBA in line with most other corporate Commonwealth entities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The changes outlined in the Bill will commence around the middle of next year and members of the existing Reserve Bank Board will be asked to serve the remainder of their terms on one of the new Boards, for continuity during the transition.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have undertaken deep and thorough consultation in the development of this Bill, and I acknowledge the work of the RBA review panel as well and everyone who took part.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Reserve Bank has been a critical economic institution in this country for more than six decades.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The changes outlined in this Bill make sure that the setting of monetary policy is done effectively now and into the future as well, equipping the Bank to serving Australia effectively in an increasingly complex and challenging economic environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They are about ensuring we have the right economic institutions and the right frameworks in place, to support a stronger economy and a better future.</span>

It was a Labor government who created Medicare, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Labor governments delivered no fault divorce, the single mothers benefit and the child support system.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Then, earlier this year, we passed legislation to increase the length of the scheme. From 1 July 2024, we added two more weeks of payment, expanding the scheme from 20 weeks to 22 weeks.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">All these changes combined mean Paid Parental Leave is now more accessible, flexible and it encourages shared care. It supports parents to take a step back from paid work and provides critical financial support at such an important time.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill I am introducing today, the Paid Parental Leave Amendment (Adding Superannuation for a More Secure Retirement) Bill, is the third significant improvement the Albanese Government has made to Paid Parental Leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Through Paid Parental Leave, the Government supports parents to take time off work after the birth or adoption of their child. Through this bill, we are taking action to support them at retirement as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Through this bill, we are investing $1.1 billion over the forward estimates to pay superannuation on Government Paid Parental Leave from July 2025.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Women make up the majority of primary caregivers in this country, leading to what has been referred to as 'the motherhood penalty', where they face greater economic insecurity because of time out of the workforce to care for children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The effect of lower income compounds over time, increasing the gap between men and women's superannuation balances at retirement. The data is clear- women retire with around 25 per cent less super than men.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Paying super on Paid Parental Leave is a positive investment into the future of working women and in the broader economy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">For babies born or adopted from 1 July 2025, this bill delivers all eligible parents with an additional 12 per cent of their Paid Parental Leave as a contribution directly to their super fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This super contribution will match the Superannuation Guarantee rate as at 1 July of the financial year the PPL is taken. It will rise with any future increases to the legislated Superannuation Guarantee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The contribution will be made annually by the Australian Tax Office after the end of each financial year. It will include an additional interest component to address any forgone superannuation fund earnings as a result of the payment not being made more regularly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Most parents won't need to do anything further to receive their superannuation payment and the claim process for Paid Parental Leave will not change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Around 180,000 families will benefit from the changes. Once the PPL scheme reaches 26 weeks in 2026, and based on a Superannuation Guarantee rate of 12 per cent, the maximum amount a family would receive in superannuation contributions is around $3,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill, and our two PPL laws before it, send a clear message that the Government is committed to a stronger parental leave system, and we want to see this reinforced throughout workplaces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government payment is a minimum entitlement, designed to complement employer-provided leave.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Paying super on Government-funded Paid Parental Leave will continue to normalise parental leave as a workplace entitlement, like annual and sick leave.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2022-23, 63 per cent of reporting employers offered employer-funded paid parental leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This positive trend demonstrates employers increasingly see themselves as having a role alongside Government in providing paid parental leave.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We know that when businesses offer their own employer-funded parental leave entitlements, it is a major way to attract and retain staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While we encourage employers to do this, this bill is about strengthening the Government scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to adding super to the Government payment, this bill will ensure the parental leave framework in the Fair Work Act complements the Paid Parental Leave Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unpaid parental leave in the Fair Work Act is an entitlement that supports parents to remain connected to paid employment while they care for their child.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill includes minor technical amendments to clarify drafting to ensure parents can access 'keeping in touch days' during a period of continuous unpaid parental leave to remain in contact with their workplace and help facilitate their return to work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="310860" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HODGINS-MAY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:45</span>):  We are in the midst of a housing crisis, one of the worst Australia has ever seen. Rental prices are at an all-time high and are only set to increase, leaving over 640,000 households needing social housing they just can't get. At the same time, we know that 122,000 people experience homelessness in Australia on any given night. Our housing system is broken. An urgent and transformative change is needed. Yet the only solution the Labor government is offering in response to this crisis is its Help to Buy scheme, a scheme that in its current form will screw over 99.8 per cent of renters and see the housing crisis get worse. This bill and Labor's so-called Help to Buy scheme offer up to 10,000 people the chance to have the government purchase 30 to 40 per cent of a private home. A person will only be eligible if they earn below $120,000 for a couple and $90,000 for an individual and if the house price is below a certain amount, depending on the city or region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The intent of the policy is to reduce the amount of money a renter needs to purchase a home and the ongoing cost of a mortgage by allowing the government to own part of the home. However, in effect, all this scheme does is establish a terrible housing lottery where a maximum of 0.2 per cent of renters will get to access the scheme every year while the other 99.8 per cent of renters will find it even harder to buy a home. Throughout the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill, expert witness after expert witness made clear that the Help to Buy scheme would only drive up housing prices. We live in one of the wealthiest countries in the world. To have hundreds of thousands of people without shelter or in severe rental stress is completely inexcusable. So why then is the only legislation Labor is putting forward this year in response to the crisis one where the majority of people lose? What is even more astonishing is that Labor seem to have no concrete understanding of their scheme's impact. Evidence provided to the Senate inquiry into this bill revealed that the Department of the Treasury had not undertaken any modelling on the effects that this scheme would likely have on housing prices. Whether small or large, any increase in house prices hurts renters who are trying to buy a home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Failing to get proper modelling of the impact of the scheme is deeply irresponsible but perhaps not surprising for a government that blindly hands out massive tax breaks to property developers year after year. From the moment that this bill was introduced, the Greens have been willing to pass Labor's Help to Buy scheme if Labor negotiated with us on negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts. These handouts, as many witnesses to the Senate inquiry said, systematically disadvantage renters by collectively pushing up the price of houses. With the money saved from phasing out the big tax handouts for property investors, we could fully fund the Greens' plan to establish a public property developer to build 610,000 good-quality homes to be sold and rented at below-market prices. But Labor is refusing to listen to us or the experts about what is really needed to fix the housing crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, as you cozy up to property developers, banks and investors, that housing crisis is having real and painful consequences on everyday people. Each day, my team and I hear stories from people in Victoria who are having to make impossible decisions about whether to buy food and medicine or pay their rent. We are hearing from people who are living in properties not fit for winter or filled with mould because they are scared that they won't find a property if they leave, and from people having to move back in with their parents because they simply can't afford to pay rent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to share a story I recently heard from Sonya Semmens, the Greens local candidate for the federal electorate of Macnamara, an electorate where 19 per cent of residents are experiencing rental stress. While Sonya was out doorknocking, she encountered a young woman carting all of her belongings onto the nature strip in front of a house. When she asked why they were doing this, the young woman told Sonya that they had to move out of their home because they had recently received a 64 per cent rental increase, one they simply couldn't afford. Let me repeat that: a 64 per cent rental increase. How is that even legal? While Sonya was helping these women move their belongings onto the nature strip, she asked them where they were going to move to. They told her that they had nowhere to go and their only option was to sleep on friends' couches. In a wealthy country such as Australia, this is absolutely devastating. Couch surfing is a form of homelessness, and it is because of the broken housing system, where a 64 per cent rent increase is legal, that they were forced into this situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to share some other stories from Victorians struggling to survive because of the housing crisis. These are stories from <span style="font-style:italic;">Everybody's home</span>, the final report from the People's Commission into Australia's Housing Crisis. Christopher from Collingwood said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The story of my last 18 years of survival is harrowing and heartbreaking. I'm broken. I'm burnt out. I'm furious that my chances at improving my life have been hampered at every turn by government inaction and cynical policies… I could have been something … Instead I've been unable to study or work or hold meaningful social connections because I've been struggling to keep a roof over my head.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Pauline from Frankston told the commission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I spent last winter, one of the coldest on record, in a unit with a leaking roof, mould and fungi growing in my bedroom and without a working heater leading to me suffering a heart attack. I am trying to move but I cannot find another rental within my price range. I have been on [the] priority over 55 housing waiting list since 2016.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amanda from Geelong shared:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I have been on a public housing waiting list for over 10 years in regional Victoria. I was told by a housing officer that by the time my name would be called off the list l would be dead as the wait list is so long … All l want is a safe affordable place to call home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Petra from Bundoora told the commission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Long waiting lists for public housing combined with limited supports able to help, my only option, which I'm very grateful for, is private rental however at great expense financially, emotionally, mentally and physically. [I] have no choice but to use buy now pay later for essentials. Accessing food relief which is soul destroying but still not able to have regular healthy meals which impacts overall wellbeing. [It is] impossible to have a haircut, see a dentist, replace old and worn clothes … [I] have had to ask [a] neighbour for toilet paper, it's absolutely devastating and no way to live. Actually it's not living, I wouldn't even call it surviving.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These stories, along with the stories from my home electorate of Macnamara, are harrowing, but they are all too common. Tell me, Labor, how is your Help to Buy scheme supposed to help these people and the hundreds of thousands of other people across the country in extreme rental pain?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the last month, we have seen Labor grandstand about their decision to lift wages of early childhood educators an extra 15 per cent. While this decision was an important step and long overdue, the stark reality is that, even with this pay rise, it would take an educator 31 years to save the deposit for a mortgage. Early childhood educators are being priced out of local housing and rental markets and forced to find jobs elsewhere. This is having an enormous impact on regional and rural communities, where often there are more than three people per childcare place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I visited Castlemaine and talked to some local families who told me they have been on waiting lists for years for early childhood education. One woman had been waiting for three years. She was on the waiting list when she was pregnant and her child had just turned three and she still hadn't been offered a place. She said she had $50,000 in her superannuation and couldn't go back to work. She was so anxious. She was pregnant and anxious about what future lay ahead for her. As a result, parents—mainly mothers—are unable to go back to work, because they can't get their kids into care.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When speaking to the local community, a key reason for the lack of child care was that educators couldn't find affordable housing. Unlike in metropolitan areas, essential workers in the regions can't be easily replaced from neighbouring suburbs. Early childhood education and care is a fundamental right. All kids should have access to high-quality, free, universal early years education. It's shameful that the lack of access to affordable housing is holding kids back from crucial early development and preventing parents from finding and maintaining work. While Labor is trying to say that their Help to Buy scheme will help early educators and other essential workers buy a house, the reality is that this bill in its current form will help only 0.2 per cent of renters. Without scrapping tax handouts and stopping unlimited rent increases, the Help to Buy scheme will do very little to help educators find housing and families living in childcare deserts to get the care that they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On public housing: this bill will also do nothing for the hundreds of thousands of people seeking help from homelessness services every year. They are in desperate need of public and genuinely affordable housing that simply isn't available. While the additional funding for the HAFF gained through the Greens negotiations last year was an important boost in funding for genuinely affordable housing, it still falls well below the funding needed to fill the massive shortfall of affordable housing in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If Labor phased out tax handouts for property developers and investors, they could expend billions of dollars building public housing and build around half a million homes. That would come close to ending the shortfall of public housing in this country. Think about the millions of lives that we could change right now if the Labor government had the guts to stand up to the banks, property developers and massive property investors who benefit from our broken housing system. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese often speaks of growing up in public housing, yet it seems he is pulling up the ladder behind him as his government simply tinkers around the edges of this broken system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be very clear: this bill and Labor's Help to Buy scheme in its current form will see the housing crisis get worse. We cannot fix the housing crisis by pushing up housing prices and making it harder for 99.8 per cent of renters to buy a home. Labor, you will not fix the housing crisis by giving a lucky few more cash to bid up the price of housing at auctions. You will definitely not fix the housing crisis without touching negative gearing and the capital gains discount, the massive tax handouts for property investors that are denying millions of renters the chance to buy a home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have a clear plan to make the transformative change needed to fix the housing crisis. We want to establish a federal housing trust to build a million public homes and social homes across cities, towns, regions and remote areas over the next 20 years. We want to slash the public housing wait list and end homelessness by building 875,000 good-quality public homes across Australia. The Greens also want to strengthen renters' rights by capping rent increases, ending no-grounds evictions once and for all, giving renters the right to longer leases and giving tenants the right to make minor changes. We also want to create a national renters protection authority to make it easier for renters across the country to advocate for their rights. Importantly, we want to ensure our tax system is no longer stacked in favour of wealthy investors. The Greens want to phase out negative gearing for people with two or more investment properties and wind back the capital gains tax discount. These changes are supported by many renters across the country, and we know that we can deliver the change necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2022, before being elected, Anthony Albanese made a clear promise that his Labor government would leave no-one behind and hold no-one back. He touted an ambitious plan for a better future for all Australians, yet here we are, nearly three years later, when rents are increasing at nearly double the rate of wages, and the best that Prime Minister Albanese can do is the Help to Buy scheme, a scheme that will effectively screw over 99.8 per cent of renters and make housing less affordable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, no-one is buying your meaningless rhetoric anymore. People want real action, particularly the five million renters in this country who know the system is stacked against them. The Greens are offering real solutions, and come the next election I think Australia is going to vote based on who is actually representing their interests, not those of property developers, moguls and banks. Labor, if you aren't willing to come to the table and negotiate with us on real solutions that benefit most renters, not just 0.2 per cent, then be ready to face the consequences at the next election. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEWART</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  The Albanese Labor government wants more Australians to be able to get into the housing market sooner with smaller deposits and lower repayments. We want the dream of homeownership to be not just a dream but a reality, and that's exactly what this scheme will do. Help to Buy is a transformative proposal which will help tens of thousands of Australians reach that dream of owning their homes for the first time. How incredibly life changing. It will give a hand up to so many working families and take hundreds of dollars off their mortgage each month going forward. Under this scheme around 40,000 Australians—that is no small number—will be able to finally get ahead and buy their first home, with a supporting contribution from the government to make homeownership a reality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Eligible Australians will be able to apply for the government to provide an equity contribution to their first home of up to 40 per cent of the cost of a new home or 30 per cent of an existing home. A lower deposit threshold will take pressure off their mortgages. They'll be able to secure themselves a home in which to raise their families and settle down. It's not just a quick leg-up for families purchasing their first home; it's a long-term solution, ensuring that Australians can have the security of a roof over their heads. Every Australian should have safe and secure housing, and we want to support them in buying their first home. This government wants to see more nurses, more teachers and more early childhood educators take that step and buy their first home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to government two years ago, we've been hard at work building more houses for Australians. We have set an ambitious goal of building 1.2 million homes by the end of the decade and we intend to deliver. We have kickstarted the construction of new houses by freeing up more land for housing and cutting red tape to fast-track the construction of new homes. We can't build all these homes overnight, but we can take meaningful steps to make sure Australians can have roofs over their heads. That includes increasing rent assistance, which the Albanese Labor government has increased by 45 per cent since coming to office, along with the biggest investment in social and affordable housing in over a decade, financing the construction of 40,000 new social and affordable homes across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who grew up in a housing commission house myself, I'm incredibly proud to be part of a government that is investing a record amount of money in this space. These are meaningful steps which have led to lasting impacts on Australians, and the Help to Buy scheme will only add to our record. As we build more and more homes, we want more working families to get a chance to own their own home. But time and time again the Greens and the coalition have come together to block meaningful action in this place, whether it's the Australia Future Fund or the Help to Buy scheme. They take every opportunity to turn their backs on aspiring Australians to peddle their nonsense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When push comes to shove, the Greens and the Liberals do not have your back. They'd rather have a cheap stunt and parade around to their supporters than actually get anything done. The coalition does not have a plan, and the Greens are willingly following them into their 'no-alition' mind state. When the coalition were in power, they were a complacent bunch who rung their hands and sat idly by as housing got more and more expensive and wages stayed stagnant—by design, no less. Instead of offering first home buyers a hand up, they turned a pointed the finger at migrants while ordinary Australians struggled to pull together enough for a deposit. This is who the Greens are teaming up with to block our housing plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now look at the opposition. Instead of helping us build more homes, instead of offering Australians a helping hand, their solution is to raid your super. They want to tank your children's future in retirement with what experts have rightly trashed as one of the worst policy proposals in the 21st century. They cannot pull themselves together to support anything this Labor government has put forward, because the details don't matter to them. Before they've even heard the details, they're happy to say no. They've run out of ideas and they've reverted to their basic programming of wanting to rip money out of your super and blame immigrants, when the truth is that they were asleep at the wheel for a decade. They let housing get away from Australians. The coalition has no plan and no future plan for Australians. We have a scheme which can lower the deposit rate to two per cent for eligible Australians and take hundreds off their monthly payments, but that's too much for the coalition's taste. That's too accessible for them. The dream should only be available to the lucky few, according to those opposite, and the Greens are backing them in that ambition. They have taken every opportunity to stand in the way of building more homes or giving Australians a fair go at buying a house.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's the Greens, who care more about building their social media followers than they do about building homes. They spend more time making TikToks about housing than they do actually voting for it—but, tick-tock, the clock is ticking. Every time this Labor government tries to make a positive difference in people's lives, whether it be through building more homes under the Housing Australia Future Fund or now with the Help to Buy scheme, the Greens take the opportunity to grandstand and block action. Housing affordability is a serious problem which requires grown-up solutions. Clearly there are some people in this place who aren't up to the task. What we do not need in this country is more opportunistic Greens who see people suffering as nothing less than an opportunity to take cheap shots at the government rather than sit down and help us pass legislation that will make a real difference to Australians today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all want what is best for Australians. It is a fact that a shared equity scheme is not a brand-new idea, but it is certainly a popular one. Former Liberal prime minister Scott Morrison himself suggested years ago that a shared equity scheme would help with mortgage stress for first home buyers, before ultimately sticking it to ordinary Australians to get a leg up against Labor. Shared equity is even in the Greens' platform, for all the commentary over here, but they're still going to stand there and vote against it. It's an idea that they had, but they're going to stand here and vote against it, because that's what they do. They're happy to grandstand with the opposition and block meaningful action, because that's what they do. The Greens political party are holding legislation up even if they agree with it. For them, it's not about the outcome; it's about the campaign. Thousands and thousands of Australians will continue to face pressure on their mortgages, unable to access this transformative Help to Buy scheme, all because the Greens political party want to make a political statement. They are literally playing with people's lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the Greens I say that blocking this scheme to help more Australians own a home is certainly a statement, and it's a statement that I'm sure Australians will remember when they go to the polls next year. They'll remember that the Greens political party are not serious about housing. They know that you're a party of protest, not a party of action. Why else would they side with Peter Dutton to block young people from getting into housing if it isn't just about them being a party of protest? Because they are full of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As thousands of Australians call out asking for action on housing, the Greens will say one thing on social media and then vote another way in this Senate. They will turn around and vote down action with the Liberals. That is exactly what they are doing with your future, young people of this country. If the Greens or the Liberal Party were serious about getting housing affordability under control, there is one very practical and pragmatic thing they could do: vote for this bill. Instead of grandstanding or being complacent, they should pull themselves together and vote for something that we can all agree on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Help to Buy scheme is an opportunity for Australians to get ahead and reach that dream. We want more hardworking Australians to have secure roofs over their heads. We want them to settle down and be supported as they raise families, just as lots of people in this place have had the privilege to do. But they don't want that for other people because they are the type of people that, once they climb the ladder, pull the ladder up after them. What a shame. That is exactly what's on display in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With lower deposit rates and even lower repayments on their mortgage, these families have a chance to own a home for the first time in their lives. Yet here we are today, with the Greens political party teaming up with the Liberals to stop tens of thousands of hardworking Australians from getting into the market with this shared-equity scheme. These Australians have worked hard and deserve to own their own home. Help to Buy would go a long way to helping Australians with the cost of living. We know mortgages and rents are the largest costs hitting working families in Australia, so it's a shame the Liberals and the Greens team up time and time again and choose to prioritise political pointscoring over real-world action. Financial security and putting a roof over the head of every Australian is no laughing matter. Political games should not be played. And that is exactly what's on display in this Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With whatever time I have left, I want to leave the coalition and the Greens with this one simple message: pull yourselves together. Get behind this scheme or get out of the way, and let us deliver meaningful action on housing for Australians, as the country expects us to. They want more affordable homes, they want to buy their first home, and they want lower mortgage rates. Stop standing in the way of Australians' aspirations and get behind what could be the difference between tens of thousands of families getting a home and those families missing out again and again thanks to the Greens and the Liberals teaming up in this place. Shame on you!</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:13</span>):  Sometimes it's useful or instructive to look at a piece of legislation when it comes to this chamber and break it down into two simple parts: a policy part and a politics part. I've seen some amazing legislation in this place that's truly driven reform, that's been built on years of evidence and testimony from multiple stakeholders and multiple Senate inquiries, with a lot of hard work by a lot of senators in this place and across political divides, like the original NDIS legislation and the Gonski reforms, which the Labor Party should be very proud they brought in. I've seen the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry deliver significant reform that we've all supported. When you get good policy like that, it kind of drives the politics. Everybody gets behind it. But then you get pieces of legislation, like the ones we're dealing with tonight—the Help to Buy Bill 2023 and the Help to Buy (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2023—where a government tries to drag the Senate by the nose, using politics to get everybody to support legislation when it's not based on good evidence. In fact, the evidence suggests it's actually not good policy. But they try and beat the drum, get up in here and make big statements—very short on any policy detail, I may say, from what I've heard in here tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth having a good look at why the policy is so inadequate, and I would like to start by saying, firstly, that it's not enough. If you want to do something about the rental crisis then you need to do something about the rental crisis. If you want to do something about housing affordability in this country then you need to actually act on housing affordability in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is my 13th year in this place. My colleagues and I, since I arrived here, have repeatedly debated, brought in legislation and initiated Senate inquiries into multiple aspects of tackling inequality in this country, especially around housing. We've continually tried to remove the distortions in our tax system, like negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions, that not only remove billions of dollars of taxpayer funds that should be paying for schools and hospitals but also distort the housing market, make it so unfair for many Australians who are forced to rent and can't afford to buy their own homes, and give a leg-up to wealthy property investors and retirees in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know Mr Shorten announced his retirement last week. Kudos to him. He not only tackled the banks and did his best as opposition leader at the time to get that debate through this place but also tried within the Labor Party to take on these big reforms, which are absolutely crucial if we're going to fix this problem. But no. It's too politically difficult for the Albanese government: 'Small target—don't want to go anywhere near it.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What about other reforms that are necessary, like cracking down on money laundering in this country, something that, once again, my Greens colleagues and I have spent many years working on? I'm pleased to say that at least the Attorney-General is doing some submissions and consulting on the tranche 2 laws, which leave a massive loophole in Australia for accountants, real estate agents and other entities to advise their clients on how to hide behind shell companies and avoid transparency for money laundering. Money laundering is a massive issue in Australia, particularly the dark money that goes into our real estate market, where foreign investors pump billions into Australia, buying properties at auctions and competing against everyday Australians who want to buy their own homes. Why is it that respective governments haven't cracked down on these loopholes in our money-laundering laws when other countries have? I certainly hope Mr Dreyfus finally brings in those tranche 2 laws, because every attorney-general prior to him said they would and then never did.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is so much more that we should be doing on building public housing, but where are the big plans to build public, social and affordable housing in Australia? Across this country, millions of renters are struggling to keep their heads above water. With house prices and mortgages soaring, this scheme that we're debating here tonight just isn't good enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's where it comes to the politics. This is the kind of thing on which the government will go to the next election and say, 'We've acted for Australians to help them get in to buy their own homes and get then out of rental stress, and here's what we've done.' I'm not sure whether the LNP have talked about this, but, as the Senate has heard from my colleagues tonight, this will potentially—I say 'potentially', but in fact it is very unlikely—give a leg-up to just 0.2 per cent of renters in this country. What about the other 99.8 per cent of renters in this country? What are they going to do? Why won't they get access to this scheme? How stingy! Then we're going to see it used as a slick promo going into the next election, saying that the Albanese government has somehow acted on one of the great crises of our time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I need to say that from the moment this bill was introduced the Greens have been willing to work with Labor to pass this scheme if they negotiate with us on the policy that actually matters, like removing negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts and a whole bunch of other really important policies. We've asked, in our negotiations, for them to take action on freezing and capping rents, to end tax handouts for property investors that stop renters buying their first home and to establish a government owned property developer which would build 610,000 houses to be sold at just above the cost of construction and with rents capped at 25 per cent of income.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard Labor senators talk about the fact that the Greens had a shared-equity scheme at the last election. Yes, we did. You can go online and see it. But it was a shared-equity scheme that bought government-built houses under this scheme from new supply, not gave people money to go out and buy existing dwellings, which is only going to serve to push up the price of existing housing and make the crisis worse. Our scheme was specifically targeted at giving people the chance, like we see in Singapore and other countries, to buy a house off the government that they are renting from the government from new supply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has not made a single counteroffer or engaged in good-faith negotiations in any meaningful way. Why not? The last election result was a clear message from Australians that didn't give them the balance of power in the Senate. It meant they had to negotiate with other political parties to get better representation and outcomes for Australians. Why refuse to negotiate with us to get this bill through?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens believe housing is essential and a basic human need. In a country as wealthy as Australia, the government has a responsibility to ensure everyone has an affordable, quality home. In my home state of Tassie, according to the 2021 census data, Tasmania experienced the largest increase in homelessness in Australia in the five years to 2021, jumping by 45 per cent. Also in my home state, the average renter pays $6,240 more to keep a roof over their head than they did in the five years prior to that, according to the Tenants Union of Tasmania's submission to the inquiry on Homes Tasmania in July 2024. According to ABC reports published in March this year, the waiting list for social housing in Tasmania has essentially doubled, and the average time people wait on the list has gone up by a factor of four, from 16 weeks to 80 weeks. That's more than a factor of four.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This housing crisis, fuelled by the tens of billions of dollars handed out to wealthy property investors every year by the Albanese Labor government, is hurting women and children the most. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Somewhere </span><span style="font-style:italic;">to go</span> housing report, led by Impact Economics and Policy, published in November 2023, estimates approximately 604 Tasmanian women are becoming homeless each year after leaving a violent partner, while 330 are returning to one. These are the exact kinds of statistics that the Greens plan to deal with. Our massive public housing build would help alleviate that by providing safe and affordable housing at the scale we actually need, not the fraction and crumbs that the Labor Party is offering with this pathetic bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's as plain as day that renters and first home buyers are doing it so tough in my home state and in other parts of the country, but the Albanese Labor government refuses to protect the tens of thousands of people who rent in Tasmania, by implementing a rent freeze and a cap on unreasonable rent increases. The proposed Help to Buy scheme would only help, as I mentioned earlier, 10,000 of Australia's 5.5 million adult renters per year—0.2 per cent. And that's something to crow about? As a result, overall homeownership rates are lowered as more people are priced out of housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen these shared-equity schemes before. Other examples are the First Home Owner Grant scheme and the coalition's HomeBuilder program. And let's not forget the scheme we got during COVID, giving everybody a bunch of money to go out and do a house renovation. How did that work out? It massively inflated building costs. Actually, I know people who got on that scheme. By the time they had actually got the quote and got around to building or doing renovation in their house, they lost more than 50 per cent of what they would have had had they not taken up the scheme. That's how out of pocket they were, because prices were that inflated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tenants' Union of Tasmania's submission to the Tasmanian inquiry into Homes Tasmania said that the waiting list for social housing in Tasmania has essentially doubled and the average time people spend waiting on the list has gone up by a factor of more than four. What are we doing about that? We're not building any new homes in Tasmania with any federal money at the moment. The proposed Help to Buy scheme is not going to fix this crisis, as we see homeownership rates fall and as more people are priced out of housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to see, and my colleagues would like to see, the government come to the table to negotiate. We would like to see them reform and bring in legislation that all Australians, except perhaps wealthy property investors, would like to see. Now is the time to be courageous. We know costs of living right around this country are a major election issue, if not the major election issue. You only need to go and knock on doors to see how tough people are doing it out there and see how many people are so grateful if their landlord renews their lease. Recently I doorknocked someone, a single mum, who sends a lot of the income she earns—her disposable income, if there's any left at all—to support her mother, who's on a disability pension. She actually cried and got emotional with me when she told me that she was so relieved that, just the week before I knocked on her door, her landlord had renewed her lease for another 12 months—she was that frightened about being put out on the streets. And I know those stories are everywhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it that this is the best we can do when there are so many Australians on waiting lists for public housing, when there are so many women who have been forced back into violent relationships because there are no shelters and long-term housing available for them? Surely we can do better than this? The amount of money that has been appropriated for this is a drop in the ocean. This is about getting our priorities right, not just as the government but as a parliament working together on some significant reform. This is not significant reform. The government can go out and do press conferences every day. They can also put up their social media videos. They can ask themselves questions during question time. But Australians outside this political bubble get it. They want to know why they're not being represented and why these issues aren't being taken seriously, why addressing their hurt and pain is not being prioritised by this government. Well, the Greens will prioritise that, and people will vote for us at the next election if you don't stand up for them.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="250156" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEELE-JOHN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:28</span>):  The housing crisis that our community is struggling through right now is causing so much pain to so many people. In every part of our country, people are having to choose between putting food on their table and paying their rent; being able to support their kids to go to school with something in their belly and the books they need and being able to make their mortgage payment for that month. That's not okay. That's not right. That's not acceptable. In a wealthy country like Australia, that families would have to do this, that grandparents would have to do this and that single parents would have to do this is abominable. It's a national disgrace. Housing is a human right for all people, and this government has a responsibility to ensure that everybody has an affordable, safe and accessible home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed legislation that the government brings to the parliament simply does not, simply will not, address the scale of the crisis that is being experienced by households across this country. When this law was first introduced, so many in the community read its title and felt hope. After all, it was called the Help to Buy Bill. And yet how many people would be helped to buy by this bill? Eighty per cent of renters? No. Sixty per cent of renters? No. Forty per cent? No. Thirty? Not even close. Not 10, not five, but 0.2 per cent of Australia's renters would be eligible to be 'helped to buy' by this bill—0.2 per cent of all of the renters struggling right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's worse—and it is in fact adding insult to injury—is that this program, as minuscule and inadequate as it is, actually risks making other parts of the housing system more inaccessible, more expensive, for the rest of the community. This was given as evidence to us, clearly, in the inquiry. We had some of the best experts in the country—housing policy experts and financial experts—come to the inquiry and give their view. For example, Professor John Quiggin, professor of economics at the University of Queensland, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These schemes have been around forever, but the money is eventually capitalised into house prices, so the beneficiaries gain at the expense of everyone else.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is also a risk that, over time, governments may fuel an 'assistance spiral', where the assistance makes house prices more expensive by increasing demand, prompting governments to increase assistance, pushing up prices further, and on it goes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the committee hearing, the government's own Department of the Treasury acknowledged that demand-side interventions do push up house prices, but the government is still ploughing forward with this scheme. The Senate inquiry was clear: this scheme would benefit only a tiny fraction of potential first home owners, while increasing prices for everyone not lucky enough to win Labor's housing lottery. We can't allow renters to be further locked out of buying a home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now let's talk about what this crisis actually looks like in this country. Rents have increased by 53 per cent since 2020. Renters are expected to cop an additional $5 billion in rent increases this year. Around Australia, only 0.6 per cent of rentals are affordable for someone working full-time earning the minimum wage, and close to zero—yes, that's right; I didn't misspeak; you didn't hear wrong: 'close to zero'—are affordable for people on the age pension, the DSP, JobSeeker or youth allowance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Housing prices have increased by 46 per cent since 2020. None of the most common professions in Australia can afford to buy a home right now. It would take a full-time childcare educator until 2055 to save a deposit. A full-time childcare worker would have to save from now until 2055 to be able to have in their possession a deposit, and then they'd have to spend 92 per cent of their earnings on mortgage repayments. For a primary-school teacher, it would take until 2036 to save for a home deposit. If a primary-school teacher were then to take out a home loan, they would have to pay 53 per cent of their income on home loan repayments, forcing them into severe financial stress. The real kicker is this: for a sales assistant, the most common profession in Australia, data shows that they may never be able to save for a home deposit, due to the growth of house prices at a rate faster than wages. If you are a sales assistant, the system created by the Liberal and Labor parties has effectively forever locked you out of owning your own home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The shortage of public and social housing is projected to increase under this government from an already unacceptable high of 750,000 homes. Over the next 10 years, the federal government will give over $176 billion in tax handouts to property investors through negative gearing and through the capital gains discount. These are policies which overwhelmingly benefit the rich and the influential. Overwhelmingly, in fact, they benefit members of parliament—who would have thunk it!—who, on average, own 2.5 properties each. I wonder why this parliament has never really been able to deal with the tax breaks and the golden parachutes that exist in this system for those who own more than one property. It's almost like it's because this place is full of them!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, specifically in my home town of Perth in Western Australia, the prospect of homeownership, especially for young people, is being pushed further and further out of reach by a rental crisis that this Labor government is refusing to act on. In Perth's inner suburbs, the median weekly rent is nearly $800, and it's rising, meaning that places that young families called home are now completely unaffordable. Bayswater has seen a 15 per cent increase in the median weekly rent in the last 12 months alone. Landlords have used, during this crisis, new state rental laws to punish tenants, with constituents in places like North Perth seeing a 25 to 40 per cent rise in their rents from lease to lease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the Greens have outlined our key asks in return for supporting passage of the legislation. These include action on freezing and capping rents, ending the tax handouts for property investors that stop renters buying their first home, and establishing a government owned property developer that would build 610,000 homes, to be sold off at just above the cost of construction, with rents capped at 25 per cent of income. Labor has not offered a single good-faith response to these proposals. The Greens are fighting for a two-year freeze on rent increases; a phase-out of unfair tax concessions, like negative gearing; and the reinvestment of this money into building beautiful, government built, sold and rented homes that people can actually afford. We need to take the real steps necessary to address the rental crisis. Australians deserve more than a housing lottery bill where 98 per cent of renters lose. This action must be taken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of my home town, the people of Perth, particularly the young people of Perth, deserve a government made up of members of parliament that are willing to engage with the reality that the opportunity to own your own home is being pushed further and further away, that this is a crisis and that the situation, the struggle and the pain being experienced by renters right now is not okay. The increases in the inner west in the inner suburbs of our city that have seen a weekly rent rise to $800 is not okay. That is not okay. If you are a community member in the inner suburbs, you should not have to be paying that much money to have a home. You should not have to be enduring that. If you are a member of the community of Bayswater, you should not have to be in a situation where you have to try to plan for a 15 per cent increase in the median weekly rent over the course of a year. Nobody in this place could do that. Nobody in this place could make that work. Let me tell you right now that there is no budgeting tool, no session of financial counselling and no 'Oh, let's download the app' that lets you, as a single parent, find the money to make the difference when your rent rises 25 to 40 per cent between each lease. It's not possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The failure of places like this, the failure of this government, to tackle this crisis shows just how deeply disconnected both major parties have become from the needs of the community. When you hear—and I know you hear it—the rising sentiment that nothing changes if nothing changes, when you hear that so many no longer wish to vote for the major parties because they know that you can't keep voting for the same two parties and expect to get a different result, this is why. The people of Perth and the people of WA deserve better. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:43</span>):  I rise to comment on the Help to Buy Bill 2023. I want to associate myself with the comments of my Greens colleagues that you've heard in this debate over the course of the day and also some of the outstanding comments—and I will give gratitude where it's due—of some of the opposition members that I have heard speak today in their contributions, particularly Senator Ruston and Senator Bragg. Help to Buy as it stands doesn't deal adequately with the underlying causes of the housing affordability crisis in this country. It is set to only look at a small fraction of the community at a time when we are facing one of the biggest, most widespread and entrenched problems of this generation. It has been referred to as 'the great divide'. It is the great divide between millennials and gen Zs and gen alphas—my children of the next generations, who may never be able to afford a home. The legislation is limited in scope, and it shows that it's a policy designed to make it seem like this government is actually doing something when it's really not. It's window-dressing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aside from the scale of this problem, taking a demand-side approach through a shared-equity scheme is the wrong policy for its time. As everyone keeps pointing out, we have a crisis of supply; in fact, we have an acute shortage of supply. The difference between the major parties and the Greens is that the Labor and Liberal parties want to wait for the market to magically correct itself, while the Greens are arguing for state and federal governments to step in and actually build some houses and get back to what it was originally set out to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to echo in particular the comments of my colleagues, particularly Mr Chandler-Mather in the other place, who is our housing spokesperson, that since this bill was introduced we have been very clear with the Albanese Labor government that our negotiating asks include capping rent increases, a mass build of public housing and scrapping the tax handouts for property investors, who are denying millions of renters the chance to buy a home. But Labor has offered nothing in return. We have a mixed economy, so we need to make the market do its job. It won't while it's being distorted beyond all recognition by negative gearing. These solutions are right in front of us. Negative gearing must be phased out by both state and federal governments in order to get back to the business of building homes. It has worked in the past, and it can and will work again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the contributions my Greens colleagues have made here today, they have all outlined the details of our housing program, which has been costed, along with our other policies, by the PBO, so in this speech I'll concentrate specifically on the question of access. Access to government help can involve lots of paperwork, lots of documentation and proof of ID. The First Peoples of this country, with the history that is attached to that, have plenty of horrific experiences with bureaucracy in this country, so we don't always have access to the kinds of documentation that non-Indigenous people do. We don't always have access to the economic opportunities and jobs that other Australians can easily access. So, at the end of the day, these sorts of schemes—schemes based on shared equity—tend to help the people that are already a little ahead of the game, rather than First Nations people or Indigenous people and others who face barriers of one kind or another. This is not an equitable approach. The people who are the most in need will need something more straightforward—a place they can rent at an affordable rate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is facing shortages of tradespeople and materials at this point. We need governments to step in and make sure that some of the capacity we do have is directed towards building affordable rental properties. That has to be our absolute priority so that the people who are struggling can have an opportunity to get onto the bottom rung of that ladder. We have so many people that that bottom rung is crucial for the whole of our country to ensure that we at least be ambitious enough to get there. It matters for everyone, because people don't just jump from school into homeownership. They don't have the bank of mum and dad, as somebody over that side mentioned this morning. Many people need to rent for a while, particularly while they are younger, before moving on to homeownership. That's even if it's financially possible for them to do that. And, if there's no way into the rental system, how are people supposed to complete that stage of the process before moving on to the point where they might actually even be considering something like the Help to Buy scheme?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As my colleague from Western Australia Senator Steele-John just mentioned, $800 is the average rent for families. This average is out of reach for most people. All over this country we see people who are in overcrowded share houses or staying with their parents well into their adulthood or just flat out becoming homeless because governments just don't get it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we consider the state of housing, particularly in remote communities, we are left with a feeling that governments have absolutely lost the plot altogether. They are completely out of touch. I will give you an example of that. In Martu country, in Newman, Western Australia, there hasn't been a house built since 1986—1986! Don't point the finger to that side of the chamber and say they did this in opposition. Don't point the other way and say, 'It was that side.' It was in 1986 that the last house was built, in Punmu.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The state and territory governments are not doing their jobs when it comes to building social housing, particularly in remote Australia. Even when projects are instigated, they are often poorly planned and with no community consultation. As to the housing type, the locations that would best serve those communities, the energy that is required, climate change—they're the critical questions we should now be asking in some of those remote areas as we go into a housing build.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Western Australia in particular people are being asked to leave country so as to access housing in large towns hundreds of kilometres from their traditional lands, from their homelands. The federal government must take charge of the current housing situation and work with their state and territory partners to create a national set of standards. What we know in Western Australia is that the repairs, the maintenance and the works that operate in housing, in particular public and social community housing, are below standard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to address the comments made in the other place by the member for Perth, Mr Gorman. He stated that this Help to Buy scheme is based on Western Australia's Keystart shared-equity scheme. If that's the case, then it shows us that the Help to Buy Bill is in fact inadequate for the task at hand. The housing crisis in Western Australia is rampant, as it is in many other parts of this country. Keystart does nothing to the scale of what Mr Gorman is claiming. In fact, Keystart home loans are generally more expensive than conventional lending institutions, so we're stitching people up to pay more to a shared-equity scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Presently, you can expect to pay in the vicinity of one per cent more for a Keystart loan than you do for a regular bank loan. For a loan of $300,000, that equates to an extra $200 per month in interest. If you can show me a person in Australia who's a low- or mid-range income earner who has an extra $200 a month to throw around, I will sit down right now. That is ridiculous!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, Keystart loans don't have features like offset accounts and the ability to package your banking products to save money. Therefore, you're likely to save money by refinancing with a more cost-effective product, as well as making your banking life much easier and much more efficient, which, as Senator McKim will tell you, is not our favourite subject to even talk about. People in this place, and across the way in the House, need to understand the scale of what we're looking at instead of comparing schemes that are not doing the action that we actually require.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill represents a deeply unambitious policy, introduced at a time when homelessness is becoming such an entrenched problem. As I said, the cracks were starting to show with the millennials, and now we're asking whether our gen Zs and even our gen alphas will ever be able to afford their own homes. Once homelessness becomes so entrenched in our community, it doesn't just go away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Homelessness breeds all kinds of embedded poverty, because a lack of a home base affects all aspects of a person's life. If you don't have an address, the problem I mentioned earlier—with the lack of documentation—only gets worse. You find yourself unable to make appointments with government agencies and prospective employers because you're permanently looking for shelters and basic supplies. If we think things are bad now, they're going to get 10 times worse if governments do not act in a coordinated way and do not address the deep, core issues across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government faces a massive problem, but it also has an opportunity. If they start working with the Greens and the crossbench right now to address these systemic issues, they could actually make a massive difference. There's also the opportunity to work with our communities to solve the problems for all Australians. Some politicians in this place have ideological problems with things like public housing, so they might rule themselves out of even having that conversation. The vast majority of sensible people agree that something must be done, and the goodwill is definitely there, but tinkering around the edges will not help the vast majority of people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Help to Buy scheme's impacts on house prices will be minimal, but it will increase them, not reduce them. And we need to bring prices down to affordable levels. Public housing brings prices down to the lower end of the market, providing shelter and reducing prices in the private market while, at the same time, leaving the middle and upper markets to operate as normal. The Help to Buy scheme will use resources that could otherwise be directed to more effective solutions to this crisis. Having said that, this scheme could potentially help a small number of buyers, so, as I've already flagged, there is an opportunity. If the government wanted support from the Greens, it could absolutely listen to our solutions to this issue: phasing out negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount for property investors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've said before, this is an opportunity to coordinate a national rent freeze and a cap on increases, and the whole country must increase investment in public housing. The Greens' suggestion of a public developer to direct the building of 610,000 homes over the next decade is a good way to get things done. That's the sort of thing that is needed. That is the scale of what is required. We are in an age where governments have become too scared to do anything meaningful, which is one of the reasons why we have this housing crisis in the first place. We need to take real steps to address the housing and rental crisis. Australians deserve better and need more than the housing lottery bill, where 98.8 per cent of renters lose. We simply cannot afford for this current situation to continue.</span>

Since Labor came to power about two years ago, mortgages have increased by an average of over $1,600 a month. More and more people are experiencing housing stress, and yet, instead of the big, bold, reformist approach proposed by the Australian Greens to respond to this massive social crisis, we're getting tinkering at the margins. What we are getting from Labor is, frankly, a pathetic response given the scale of the crisis. A centrepiece of that response is the Help to Buy scheme, which is basically a lottery that would help 0.2 per cent of renters and put house prices up for the other 99.8 per cent.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:00</span>):  I rise to speak to an important development that happened last Wednesday here in the parliament, where I stood with many of my Labor colleagues and the Minister for Financial Services, Stephen Jones, to announce a ban on life insurers using genetic testing to deny cover or to hike premiums.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put a little bit of a personal spin on this. Often the work that we do here in the parliament is something people don't understand. They often think that we're somehow different from the general community. Certainly I can say when my interest in the area was sparked. It was back in about 2017 or 2018 when, through the inquiry of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into the life insurance industry, I found out that there was a proposal to allow insurers to use genetic information basically to discriminate against Australians and to put the prices of their insurance up accordingly. Our report was part of a body of really good work done by the chair, Mr Steve Irons, who is no longer in the parliament; Terri Butler; Jason Falinski; Jane Hume; Matt Keogh; Chris Ketter; Bert van Manen; Peter Whish-Wilson; John Williams; Nick Xenophon; and me. In it we said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">As the use of genetic testing … in health care increases, concerns have been raised around privacy and genetic discrimination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Small">In response to … concerns over genetic discrimination, several countries have enacted legislation or voluntary agreements to restrict or fully ban the use of genetic information by insurance companies.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can let you know that I worked very hard with my colleagues across the chamber and with the insurance industry, which was covered under the Financial Services Council at that point in time—it's now with CALI, a different entity—to make sure that we got a moratorium on genetic testing. Little did I know how that would actually intersect with my own life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do a lot of work in this parliament that we're called to do. You hope it's going to be of benefit generally, but often you don't expect it's going to benefit you. I'm actually part of a family where I'm the eldest of six children but I have only four siblings remaining because my sister died of acute myeloid leukaemia when she was only 19. Five years later, my father died of a brain tumour. We had a really good run for a long time, with marriages and babies and other celebrations that were really good, but then my niece, who was nearly four, died of liver cancer. Five years later, her father—my brother Sean—passed away with a brain tumour. Sometimes in a family you just think, 'How can we have such misfortune?' But somewhere deep inside you know there's got to be an explanation for this. We again had a really good run, but not so long ago one of my nephews had a lump discerned by a doctor. It wasn't biopsied. But later on he went and got a bit more advice, and he went to a doctor who had a protocol because of genetic testing and genetic medicine. The doctor said, 'When I look at your family history, you might have a genetic mutation.' Instead of being able to get his health treatment immediately, my nephew had to go and get financial advice. He had to go and set up insurance. He had to do all of those things before he could even get a genetic test, because of the way insurance currently works in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why what happened on Thursday last week was so important. I'm so proud of the work that we did right across the political spectrum to raise awareness about this, to hold a moratorium and to continue the work with the insurance sector so that we're now on the cusp of bringing legislation to this place to prevent the kind of discrimination that happens. The last thing you need when you have been through the sort of trauma that my nephew has been through is to have to go and confront that kind of reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many really, really good reasons why this legislation, when it comes to the parliament, should be passed immediately, including the fact that the sort of genetic testing that needs to happen, so that we find out more and more and more, could make a difference. My siblings, my father and my niece who died would have had very different treatment, without radiotherapy, if the genetic knowledge had been there. We need to advance on this. And I'm very proud of the Australian parliament for where we are.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:05</span>):  We're approaching the one-year anniversary of the horrific events of 7 October, and Jewish communities in Western Australia and across Australia are feeling every bit as vulnerable now, as they face a rising tide of antisemitism. Every Australian has a right to reasonable protest, but we don't have the right to harass people, including children and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, that is exactly what happened earlier this week adjacent to Perth's only Jewish school, Carmel School. Students and passers-by were subjected to an anti-Israeli rally, one that knowingly and deliberately targeted Jewish Australian families dropping off their children. That was not an appropriate place for a demonstration. Schools should be a safe and supportive environment, not the scene of angry protests against people trying to go about their ordinary lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">WA Jewish community leaders close to Carmel School have of course been echoing this. My good friend Rabbi Dan Lieberman was quoted as saying, 'Protest where protests are held and leave children alone.' No-one should argue with that, or with a clear line being maintained between acceptable political expression and unacceptable political extremism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In light of this incident, I believe it is important to place a question on the record. What precautions have the WA police, for whom I otherwise have the greatest appreciation and respect, put in place to ensure that something like this doesn't happen again? The officers of the Western Australia Police Force have done an excellent job in the past, ensuring that places like Carmel School and other Jewish community centres are safe for those living, working and, of course, studying there. But this incident should serve as a wake-up call, especially going into the Jewish high holidays in October—an important and holy time for our Jewish community. The diligence of the WA Police Force has been very welcome, but now is a time for greater vigilance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If one Australian is threatened, all of us are threatened. We should be united in supporting the safety and security of Jewish Australians in Western Australia and indeed across the whole nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:07</span>):  Periods, menopause, endo, egg retrievals—we don't often talk about these things in the Senate. That is starting to change, thanks to some work of some excellent colleagues. But we definitely don't talk about these things in workplaces, and that needs to change as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I want to take a little time to talk about an issue that touches every corner of our workforce, regardless of gender, age or occupation, and that's the need for paid reproductive health leave. The It's for Every Body campaign is being led by the Queensland Council of Unions and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and they are seeking to enshrine 10 days of paid reproductive health leave into our National Employment Standards. This is an initiative that is not just about fairness but would be a step towards building a more inclusive, equitable and supportive workplace for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reproductive health issues vary significantly and can affect workers at any stage of their lives. From menstruation to contraception, to menopause, to hormone therapy and, yes, even to vasectomies, these are things that every family has to deal with from time to time. But they're aspects of health care that require time. They require our workplaces to be flexible, to ensure workers are supported adequately.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a campaign that's close to my heart because it would have changed the experience that I had as a mother who accessed reproductive health care to start my family. I also know that there are many families out there—and particularly many men—who go through a difficult and challenging time trying to start a family through IVF.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It really is a time where you go through a process of not talking about it, instead of having the support of your workplace, your family and your colleagues. Now, reproductive leave would provide to women and families the flexibility they need with fertility treatment, chronic conditions, miscarriages and breast screenings. Too many men and women have gone to work in pain or while going through personal and demanding treatments, with a lack support from their employer due to our current leave entitlements and also the stigma that comes with reproductive health care. In the words of Jacqueline King, QCU general secretary:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's time we have a mature conversation about how we can better support workers undergoing these kinds of treatments …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Reproductive health leave as a national employment standard will support a workforce which is happier, healthier, more productive and more inclusive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are the words of Jacqueline King, but we know that reproductive health care is essential and our leave entitlements should be talked about and considered in that context. It's essential for our workforce and for our workplace health and safety to ensure that our communities are thriving and that people get a chance to start a family when they need to. At the moment, workers have to take the gamble of entering a new workplace not knowing whether they will have to negotiate with their employers to receive the support they really need to go through that pretty difficult time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we've seen progress at a state level, with the Queensland government recently introducing 10 days of paid reproductive leave for public sector workers, we need to ensure that this right is talked about as a possible extension for all workers in Australia. The time has come for our workforces to acknowledge that reproductive leave could be a really important opportunity for every worker regardless of their employer or their industry. Reproductive health does not discriminate. Every single family I know has some experience with making those appointments, getting to those doctors and having to be available at certain times of the day and at certain times of your cycle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Men and women of all ages, backgrounds and occupations require flexibility from their workplace to address these types of issues. I look forward to speaking to the Senate on many more occasions about this important campaign. Australians deserve to work in an environment where they're not penalised for their reproductive health needs. I thank the Senate.</span>
