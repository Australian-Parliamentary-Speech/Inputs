         The government is looking at ways to reduce its deficit. We are yet to see how it is going to go about doing that. It could take a responsible course, one that we have been advocating: it could look carefully at reducing government expenditure. I do not pretend that that is easy. We do not believe that that is an easy proposition at all. There are lots of calls on government expenditure; nevertheless, reducing government expenditure is a responsible way forward to attack the budget deficit. This government is clearly a tax and spend government. Therefore, the option least attractive to it will be to look critically at government revenue.

         Having avoided that, despite the calls for a deficit reduction strategy by the Governor of the Reserve Bank on a number of occasions, the government is now about to take the much easier option of increasing taxes. As we pointed out to the Prime Minister in question time on Monday, that is in the context of promises prior to the last election to not increase taxes. No matter how the Prime Minister might want to get around that and argue about the semantics of that, it was very clear to us—I think it was very clear to everyone in Australia—that, prior to the last election, the Prime Minister was saying that there would be no increases in taxes.

         The Prime Minister's whole election strategy was based on criticism of our proposal to bring in what ultimately would have been a much fairer, more efficient and more equitable tax system. The government's whole election strategy was an attack on us. The government went to the extreme of bringing legislation into this parliament which was aimed at convincing the Australian people that its strategy was to match our proposal to reduce income tax. So we had the famous l-a-w tax cuts.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Despite what the Prime Minister said in question time on Monday, the government has reneged on that promise. It has repealed that legislation. The second stage of those income tax reductions is now not to be delivered until some time in 1998, which is a long way down the track. There is no doubt at all in my mind that the tax cuts will disappear completely off the agenda long before that. Rather than have further decreases in income tax, we will see increases in taxes and charges. The opposition is now totally aware, and the Australian people should be aware, that the problem of how to raise more revenue for the purposes of doing what needs to be done—reducing the deficit—is very much on the government's agenda. The government's current substantial deficit is the result of its high spending policies.

         Almost every day in this place a minister comes in here with a new spending initiative, a new program or a new paper of some sort that foreshadows spending. In the end, that is the only thing this government knows how to do—spend other people's money. Much of this money is wasted. Much of it is to solve problems that the government has created in the first place. Its strategy for reducing unemployment is largely based on throwing money at the problem rather than carrying out the fundamental reforms in the economy, which would lead to real job creation.

         That is not a difficult proposition. We on this side of the House understand clearly that to create real jobs we need to make it possible for businesses to employ more people. That is a simple proposition. But rather than go down the track of proper micro-economic reform and proper reform of the industrial relations system, which this government cannot do because it is bound to the rules set up by the unions—it is governed by the unions—it comes in here with all sorts of other panaceas, such as training programs and subsidies to employers. Everything is done back to front. The government always puts the cart in front of the horse rather than coming up with real and, in the end, simpler solutions to the problems of unemployment.

         Let us not talk about increasing taxes, which the government is talking about, to solve the problem. Ironically, the solution to the problem is to reduce taxes and charges. In reducing taxes and charges, particularly on small business, employment will be stimulated. There are about one million small businesses in Australia. It does not take too much imagination to realise that if each of those small businesses employed one more person there would be a significant impact on the number of unemployed.

         When I go out to my electorate, as I have recently done, and visit small businesses, look at what they are doing and talk to them about their problems, one of the problems they raise consistently is the need to get trained staff. They have certainly been let down on that score, with the very low number of apprentices currently being trained. There is a lack of trained staff and a lack of staff who are prepared to work hard. Small business people in my electorate consistently tell me that they would employ one, two, three, four or five more people tomorrow if they could get people who were genuine about seeking work.

         This government has created a system whereby people can actually choose whether to work or not. Despite its attempts in recent times to address the issue of the unemployment benefit being too generous, once again in a bandaid fashion it has simply tinkered at the edges making it possible for people to actually retain their unemployment benefit at the same time as doing some work. Employers in my electorate tell me that people are still saying to them, `I'm sorry. I really think there are some benefits for me in getting back into the work force, but, unfortunately, I can get as much in benefits from the government by the time I add them all up, having three or four children, as the wage you are offering me, even if it is the award wage'—and let us assume that those wages in many respects are very generous—`and it really is not worth my while coming to work for you.'

The government's feeble attempts to solve the problems of this country are not going to work.

         The government needs to be reminded—and I take the opportunity in the context of this debate about government expenditure—that the solution to this country's problems is not to talk about increasing taxes, but rather decreasing taxes.

There is such a diversity of programs—the government is putting money into this and money into that—yet the solutions to the huge problems of our overseas debt and the level of unemployment that persists in this country are much simpler.

         I am very concerned about the prospect of increasing interest rates. I think we are all waiting to see what the result of the meeting this morning will be. We already have very high interest rates in this country. From that base, we are about to step off further onto the treadmill which we have been on before. The Australian people remember very well the promises we have had in the past—in 1985 and beyond. We have experienced this situation before. We were told that everything was under control. We were told budget after budget that everything was fine, that we were going along well, then we had the worst recession in 60 years. We are about to get back on that same track, that same treadmill, that will take us in that same direction.

         Let me remind the House of the impact higher interest rates will have not only on families but also on small business. Many small businesses went broke during the last recession because of not only reduced demand for their products but, initially and subsequently, higher interest rates. Most small businesses rely, to a very large extent, on borrowing money for one purpose or another. They have overdrafts, short-term loans and longer term financing, but they are affected by increasing interest rates. As interest rates escalated rapidly, as they did in the late 1980s and early 1990s, many of them went broke. The effect of that was unemployment. I am very concerned about the prospect of increasing interest rates that we now have on the agenda for this country. Frankly, I do not accept the assurances of the Treasurer that the government has the economy under control. The fact is, and certainly even the government's own advice appears to have been, that it lost control of the economy very early on.

         In the context of this debate, I want to place on record my dismay at the way this government is managing the economy; in fact, it is mismanaging the economy. It has created a welfare system in this country that has pervaded almost the whole of our society. I wonder at times whether that is intentional. It is almost a new form of socialism that has been thrust upon us, a form of socialism that is not as obvious as earlier forms. Yet 4.4 million people in this country are now totally dependent on this government.

         In the early 1970s around 10 per cent of people were dependent on government for their primary source of income. The figure today is closer to 27 per cent or 28 per cent. That represents an enormous cost to government and it ought to be of great concern to people that that is the trend. Average families that previously were not in the government welfare net now find themselves there by virtue of the home child-care allowance.

Hundreds of thousands of people who were never involved with the Department of Social Security before went through the intrusive process of having the Department of Social Security write to them and ask all sorts of questions that were never relevant to the tax office in getting the dependent spouse rebate. That was available to people by a very simple mechanism.

We intend to remind the Australian people, and the government, as we head down the track toward the next election, that this Prime Minister was the Treasurer who consistently told us, in all of those years through the 1980s and early 1990s, that we were on track, that everything was under control.

         We are told by Minister McMullan—in fact, by the World Bank—that implementing the full GATT agreement would increase world trade by $213 billion in the next 10 years. That is a lot of money. But we really have to analyse that against what world trade would be if we did not have GATT. If we did that analysis, we would find that the world trade figures would be about the same. Furthermore, $213 billion is 0.7 per cent of world trade. It is not a very significant amount, but its redistribution could have catastrophic consequences. The Secretary-General of the OECD admits that the figures are highly theoretical and also theatrical. I think it does give us cause for real concern.

         There is no future in going down the low wage route. For one thing, there is simply no end to it. If overnight we were to cut a full 33 per cent off the cost of employing labour in Australia, it would simply mean that our competitors would be able to employ something like 30 cheap labour workers, say, Filipinos or Vietnamese, instead of the 40 or 45 workers they do employ now. If we analyse these figures, we can see it is a very dangerous and foolish road for Australia to go down.

It has always been that way and, as far as I can see, it always will. Free trade does nothing for this industry. It is already there and we are already highly competitive.

         We really have to rethink this issue. Basically, by executive decree, we in the Australian Labor Party have gone down the free trade route. The Liberal Party has no mind; it is simply an amorphous mass. It has this ideological predilection for free trade. It has never bothered to think about the consequences. When people in the opposition prattle on about micro-economic reform, inevitably they mean lower wages. Micro-economic reform is a code word in this nation for lowering wages, it is not the way to go for Australia. I believe there is more to be gained from a study of history than there is from a study of economics. In history, you can see the end product of where the economic actions have taken us in the past. We live in a world in which there has been a revolution in the vocabulary. Words do not mean what they used to mean anymore.

If, however, we join together two countries of equal size which have very dissimilar standards of living, over 15 years those standards of living will equalise. In the case of the United States and Canada, which are roughly equal, joining with Mexico, which has a lower population, we would see a decrease in the standard of living in the United States.

Unfortunately, what continues to be overlooked in the debate is that tariffs are not in themselves the issue but merely a symbol of the problem. In essence, a commitment to tariffs, or non-tariff barriers for that matter, is predicated on the belief that economic sovereignty is essential to any meaningful definition of nationhood—hardly a reactionary or inward-looking view.

Some APEC economies, the Prime Minister tells us, have tariffs ranging from 100 to 300 per cent.

         The Prime Minister has come to sound like a financial shark or con man. He tells us that, under APEC free trade, Australia's real output will rise by 3.8 per cent and real national income by 1.2 per cent and that exports will increase by 27 per cent and imports by 20 per cent. This runs totally counter to the thoughtful intellectual assessment of APEC provided by American academic Chalmers Johnson, who was in Australia recently to deliver a seminar.

Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition has no solutions of his own. All he does is reel out the standard right wing cliches: `lack of macro-economic reform', which should read `taxes are too high for business'; `labour market inflexibility', which should read `real wages are too high'. The problem is that his party is just as committed to simplistic forms of free trade as the Labor Party.

If I had a dollar for every time he used the term `Australia is perfectly placed', I would be able to buy a house as big as the Prime Minister's.

         It is easy to play with figures; in fact, it is an art form in this House. It is always convenient to talk about a manufacturer here or a manufacturer there in someone's electorate who is doing great things. To focus on a small sample or a small number of success stories does not, as the previous figures show, tell the true story. Bell, like many others who are totally frustrated by our obsession with market liberalisation, argues for a serious industry policy—one which contains a supportive nexus between the state and market players, the kind that we have seen in Asia and France, the kind that proponents of market liberalisation fail to acknowledge when they contrast the economic development of Australia with that of the Asian economies. William Mitchell, in an article in the same magazine, produced a set of propositions concerning the distribution of wealth that has accompanied our pursuit of free market economies over the past decade. Mitchell says:

        The facts as presented by Mitchell are, firstly, `Wages, salaries and supplements as a share of GDP at a factor cost level fell from 62 per cent in 1982-83 to 55 per cent in 1988-89.' In the bad old Liberal 1960s, the wages share averaged 56 per cent of GDP. Secondly, `The Accord has been extremely effective in reducing real wages and real labour unit costs and increasing profits.' It could have easily been designed by the coalition. Thirdly, `Between 1983 and 1993, executive salaries far outstripped non-managerial salaries.' But you will not find people in here attacking managerial salaries. They will be attacking the TWU when it tries to get a fair dinkum rise. Fourthly, `Public outlays due to tax concessions at the top end fell from 30 per cent of GDP in 1983 to 25 per cent in 1990 and in 1993 were around 28 per cent.' The government prides itself on its cuts to outlays.

         The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello)—today he is the deputy leader—has been calling for more cuts to outlays. If he wants the Prime Minister to give a commitment to no taxes, he should tell us what government expenditure he is going to cut. Fifthly, `Real wages cuts have not prompted investment in productive capital but rather in speculative ventures.' In the 1960s the investment to GDP ratio was over 26 per cent. In the 1990s it is around 21 per cent. Sixthly, `Australian investors significantly increased their stake in the rest of the world.' We might ask: what is wrong with Australia buying a bit of the world? Nothing if investment was at levels which provided full employment in Australia and if this investment managed to reduce foreign debt. The problem is that it did not.

One of the problems this House faces when we debate the economic side of Australian life is that it is difficult to get an objective assessment. Many jokes have been told about economists on the floor of this House. I just asked the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) if he could provide me with one very quickly, but the honourable member for Wills ended before we could get one out of the box.

         What we have heard from the honourable member for Wills illustrates the point I am making. In this House when we come to look at the economy and make an objective assessment of it, our views are often coloured by our political positions and perspectives. No economy in the world has been able to achieve the perfect scenario. Looking at the macro-economic settings, certain things typify the perfect economy. We would all like an economy that generates high rates of growth and has low unemployment rates. We would like an economy with low interest rates, low inflation, high levels of company profitability, high levels of industrial productivity, low debt levels, a current account that is in balance and low industrial disputation. If we put some of the more esoteric overlays on that, we could draw a picture of the perfect economy, or one that is in perfect balance.

When you put all these factors together, the Australian economy over the past three decades has seen an improvement in its competitive position of about 30 per cent. That is not a mean achievement.

Productivity levels will be maintained. Our micro-economic reform program is continuing. Our access to the international marketplace has broadened with the conclusion of the GATT, and the APEC developments at Bogor in October certainly give us grounds for great optimism.

         It is little wonder that the opposition cannot develop a consistent economic policy, because it cannot even determine a leader. We on this side of the House are very astute observers of leadership changes and are all students of politics. I am very intrigued at the underlying principles that govern the selection of Liberal leaders. It is fairly obvious that one of the underlying principles is not talent, so we have to look elsewhere. I have come up with a theory of my own. To become a Liberal leader in the 1980s and 1990s the initial of your first name has to start with either A or J—Andrew, Alex, or John, John—or you must have recyclable characteristics. They are the two characteristics for Liberal leaders today.

         I went through the potential leaders in the Liberal Party on the conservative side to save the opposition the task of selecting their next leader. There is a field of nine potential candidates: the honourable members for Warringah (Mr Abbott), Wakefield (Mr Andrew), Bruce (Mr Beale), McPherson (Mr Bradford), Mitchell (Mr Cadman), Ryan (Mr Moore), Pearce (Mrs Moylan), Curtin (Mr Rocher) and Fairfax (Mr Somlyay). If you apply that criterion of A or J, any one of those nine could be leader. If you move that criterion to the back half of the alphabet to P, then the honourable members for Higgins (Mr Costello) and Flinders (Mr Reith) come into contention. There is a deadly double, if I ever saw one.

         The Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), in recent times has come under increasing pressure over the leadership. I read the polls the other day. He has really joined the roaring 20s club, that elite band of Liberal leaders who have managed single handedly to drive their Newspoll approval rating below 30 per cent. The approval rating of the honourable member for Bennelong is 23 per cent, the former member for Kooyong, Andrew Peacock, 22 per cent and the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), 22 per cent. In the last poll, the approval rating of the honourable member for Mayo was 20 per cent. The only thing the honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for Mayo have in common is the fact that they have both polled in the Newspoll at around 20 per cent.

         The honourable member for Mayo is the limbo king of the Newspoll. When we move the popularity stakes bar down he still manages to get under it. For us old time limbo dancers, it is really a question of: how low can he go? The honourable member for Bennelong is the man in contention at the moment. He is the friend of the tax bludgers in the 1970s and he is making a sprint for the Liberal leadership. He does not want to wield the knife; he wants to be drafted.

         —In relation to these appropriation bills now before the House, I intend to deal with several disturbing current national security issues about which the Australian people and parliament have a right to know. I will cover a range of issues relating to the management—or rather mismanagement—of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO. In no way am I concerned to criticise the many fine Australians who have worked for ASIO in various capacities and who have, with too little reward and recognition and at some degree of personal risk, served and continue to serve the interests of Australia. However, I am critical of ASIO senior management and the Director-General of ASIO, Mr David Sadleir, who is the wrong man in the wrong organisation at the wrong time.

         I turn firstly to the attack on the Iranian embassy in Canberra on 6 April 1992. This unprecedented attack on a foreign embassy in Canberra was a first-order intelligence failure by ASIO. According to the official report on the attack on the Iranian embassy, ASIO failed to provide a threat assessment concerning the Iranian embassy, despite the fact that nearly 20 premeditated attacks on Iranian embassies in 11 other capital cities were reported in news services prior to the attack on the Iranian embassy in Canberra.

         ASIO's responsibility for securing the embassy was discussed in its annual report to parliament of 1990-91, which referred to its role in warning `various agencies of protection and enforcement so that potentially threatening incidents can be forestalled'. The same report also claimed that `politically motivated violence dominated ASIO's operational and analytical work due to growing tension in more than one ethnic community over events in home countries'. In the event, the Australian government reportedly paid between $10 million and $12 million in compensation and increased embassy protection to the Iranian authorities. The ASIO budget should have borne that cost.

The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has refused a formal request for an inquiry on the grounds that it is not his responsibility. It is the responsibility of the government, however, to reveal why there was, in the words of the Auditor-General's report No. 44 of 1993-94 into the electronic capture of passenger card data by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, `an unprecedented computer breakdown' of DIEA's entry control system at a crucial time—six days after the attack on the Iranian embassy—when an entry control officer attempted to obtain a list of passengers to detain for questioning.

It should be noted that ASIO is responsible for protective and physical security of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which it lists in its 1993-94 report as one of its major external clients. Yet a whispering campaign developed the theme that the fire was deliberately lit as ASIS had a vested interest in having its records destroyed.

         I turn to another vital question: the internal security of ASIO. For ASIO, 1994 has been the year of the spy. The revelations concerning ASIO over the last two years, and in 1994 in particular, point to one irresistible conclusion: that the director-general should resign. In previous speeches in this House, in February and June this year, I pointed out that ASIO's efforts against the KGB and its successor—the Russian foreign intelligence service, the SVRR—had been compromised. Since that time, our security situation has deteriorated even further. ASIO has had to reconstruct its computer and telephone systems as they were believed to have been compromised by Soviet agents. Since that time, ASIO has reportedly replaced the system at an estimated cost of $7 million, although the precise cost is unknown.

         I now wish to examine ASIO's counterintelligence record. It will not take long. ASIO's counterintelligence record—that is, the protection of ASIO against penetration by hostile or foreign intelligence services—can be summed up in one word: failure. Despite the director-general's description of himself in the press in August 1993 as the nation's `top spy catcher', ASIO has not uncovered a single KGB or SVRR agent by its own efforts. Every piece of information concerning the penetration of ASIO by the KGB or its successor, the SVRR, has been supplied by foreign intelligence services.

         In February 1994, the government reluctantly and under pressure publicly revealed that the US Central Intelligence Agency had informed ASIO in late 1992 of the role of several Soviet intelligence officers in Australia. They were subsequently expelled from Australia. The government disclosure was made in February 1994 only after I had informed the House that several Russian intelligence officers had been expelled from Australia. Until that time, Senator Evans had been conducting his own unique form of communication with the Russian foreign minister and the head of the Russian foreign intelligence service, the SVRR, by secret letters—secret, that is, from scrutiny.

Primakov, a wily and former long-time KGB agent, laconically replied to Senator Evans that the expelled officers were `rogue elements' whose activities were not authorised by the Russian government.

        We must also thank the ABC for publicising the fact that six Russian intelligence officers have recently arrived to replace the six officers expelled from Australia in 1993. In an interview on ABC radio on 15 November this year, Professor Desmond Ball of the Australian National University, who is an internationally recognised expert on Soviet intelligence and security and is better informed, frankly, than the government, stated that six Russian intelligence officers had recently settled in Australia to replace the officers expelled in 1993. Further, according to Professor Ball, the six Russian intelligence officers are performing the same espionage functions as the officers who were expelled in 1993. The Russian intelligence officers were all settled in Australia by mid-1994. Yet Senator Gareth Evans assured the media in February 1994 that the Russians had been purging agents from their embassies around the world. I emphasise that, in the period 1992-94, not one of the Russian intelligence officers or KGB or SVRR agents inside ASIO were discovered by ASIO. ASIO management has been asleep.

         I now wish to refer to the Australian Federal Police investigation into KGB-SVRR penetration of ASIO conducted in 1992 and 1993, called Operation Liver. Regrettably, a press campaign has begun to describe Operation Liver as a costly failure. However, this view is certainly not shared by Mr Gerard Walsh, the Deputy Director-General of ASIO. In a speech at a social but secret gathering of ASIO staff late last week, Mr Walsh claimed that Operation Liver was, in fact, highly successful. I will, of course, not disclose the entire contents of Mr Walsh's speech or where it was made. However, I can inform the House that Mr Walsh was so concerned at the morale of ASIO, at the extent of penetration of ASIO, that he requested staff to express the same spirit as that exhibited at the function to the task of assisting ASIO in detecting Soviet agents and not to allow personal loyalties to cloud their judgment.

         Mr Walsh did not state—although he is no doubt aware—that ASIO's records were so inadequate that, in the course of Operation Liver, ASIO could not identify over 20 Soviet agents and assets, detected by the Federal Police, operating outside the Russian embassy, who had contacts with ASIO officers. Once again, these agents and assets had been detected by the Australian Federal Police and not by ASIO. The Federal Police took over the telephone interception of suspected ASIO officers, as ASIO lacked the equipment and resources. Over 40 telephone intercepts were conducted—an unprecedented number, which indicates the seriousness of the investigation. Additionally, four ASIO staff left ASIO without apparent loss of entitlements. Why? Because it could not be proved whether they were wittingly or unwittingly involved in ASIO's most serious scandal to date.

         This is an extraordinary state of affairs. A key statutory responsibility of ASIO is to ascertain the security status of its own staff. The person responsible for ASIO is the Director-General, Mr David Sadlier. Mr Sadlier should resign. In calling for the resignation of Mr Sadlier as Director-General of ASIO, I am not reflecting on his loyalty to Australia but on his competence. Mr Sadlier is a competent diplomat; Mr Sadlier is an incompetent Director-General of ASIO. He does not have the temperament or training to be head of ASIO. He was appointed Director-General of ASIO to improve its relations with intelligence services in our region. Mr Sadlier does not know any Asian language; he is not an intelligence officer. Under Mr Sadlier, ASIO has veered from disaster to disaster. The government is well aware that ASIO morale is at an all-time low. For ASIO the game is up.

         The government should therefore give serious consideration to amalgamating most of the functions of ASIO with the Australian Federal Police—after, of course, the most vigorous vetting. It is my understanding that many ASIO staff would welcome amalgamation with the Federal Police. They realise that ASIO is no longer a viable organisation. They realise that ASIO is not held in high regard by the government or overseas intelligence organisations. They also realise that ASIO is beyond micro-level management reform, re-organisation or even the appointment of yet another new Director-General. Increasingly, even the government is conceding that, given the Iranian embassy fiasco and the cost of protracted investigations and inquiries into ASIO, ASIO is no longer cost effective. The government's continuing inquiries into ASIO are evidence of this belief. From 1987-88 to 1993-94, ASIO vetted over 109,000 Australians; only one adverse and nine qualified assessments were issued. These figures would be laughable, if the situation concerning the integrity and efficiency of ASIO were not so serious. They underline the point that even ASIO's vetting function has become obsolete.

         Last week in the New South Wales parliament, the Minister for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Michael Photios, made a number of outrageous allegations in relation to the Macarthur Migrant Resource Centre. In response to a Dorothy Dix question from the state member for Camden, Dr Liz Kernohan, Mr Photios told the New South Wales parliament that the annual general meeting of the Migrant Resource Centre in Macarthur was the focus of a Labor inspired stacking exercise. He claimed that the Labor candidate for Camden, Mr Peter Primrose, and I conspired with a presumably large number of ALP members to try to overthrow the incumbent management committee.

         He further alleged that I sought to postpone the AGM and that I had threatened to defund the organisation unless I got my way. He alleged that Mr Primrose's campaign director, Mr Wayne Warton, had `orchestrated the whole affair', walking members into the meeting and `running the whole show on his mobile phone'. Mr Photios alleged that most of these people were members of the Camden branch of the ALP.

         As I told this House on Monday in my personal explanation, these allegations are totally untrue and without foundation. They should be treated with the utter contempt that they deserve. However, I will take the time to refute these allegations in some detail because Mr Photios and Dr Kernohan have chosen to raise these completely baseless allegations under parliamentary privilege. That means that those people accused have no opportunity for legal action against those who would defame them and, apart from me and the state member for Campbelltown, Mr Michael Knight, they do not have access to the forum of parliament to respond in their defence.

         To start with, I was at the meeting because I was invited by the President of the Migrant Resource Centre, Sergeant Jeff Trichter, to be the keynote guest speaker, as I had been the previous year, in recognition of my long-term support for the organisation. In fact, Sergeant Trichter telephoned my office on three occasions to check that I would be attending. At the same time, he also invited Mr Primrose, who, as I said, is the state Labor candidate for Camden, and his wife Jan to attend. Both of these people have a record of advocacy and support for the non-English speaking community in the Macarthur area.

But it is here that the minister's allegations can be exposed for the fraud that they are. Firstly, I can hardly be accused of gatecrashing a meeting in which I was invited to be guest speaker.

         I have already dealt with the outrageous claim made by Minister Photios that I threatened to defund the MRC—to take away its federal funding—unless the meeting was deferred. This is a most serious allegation and, as I have said already, it is an outrageous and malicious lie. It is hard enough to get sufficient funding for community organisations.

         This motion to defer the meeting had nothing to do with the question of who may or may not have won a particular ballot in the annual elections. It was moved on the basis of problems arising from the period prior to the conduct of the annual general meeting. The motion requested that the meeting be deferred to allow for mediation in order to resolve matters which were in dispute in relation to the conduct of the annual elections and, further, that the Australian Electoral Commission be asked to conduct the elections.

         This motion was moved at the beginning of the meeting just as I was about to be asked to address the meeting as guest speaker. It was to my great concern and embarrassment that I then became aware that there was a serious dispute within the organisation over the conduct of the annual elections. I am now aware that this involves court challenges and several allegations of improprieties. Notwithstanding this, the move to place the matter in the hands of the Australian Electoral Commission was opposed by Sergeant Trichter and also by several other prominent members of the existing management committee.

I expressed concern at the possible damage to the organisation which could be caused by the escalation of the dispute, especially given reports of the closure of migrant resource centres in other states. This was a reflection of my genuine concern and could not possibly be construed either as a demand that the meeting be deferred or as a threat to defund the centre, as the minister has alleged.

         As it turned out, Mr Knight, in his role as returning officer, found that he could not make a determination of the outcome of the deferral motion due to uncertainty over the membership credentials of some of the people in attendance.

         I now turn to the minister's allegations that the meeting was stacked with Labor Party members to take over the centre. The minister claims that these people were from the Camden branch of the ALP. I myself am a member of the Camden branch of the ALP. As the federal member, you would expect that if there were members of my own party branch present I would recognise them. But, in fact, I can only recall seeing three members of the Camden branch in attendance at the meeting, including me—there were me and two others. As about 100 people attended on the day, I do not think that two could be considered as a stack of an organisation.

It seems that the current executive has a very poor relationship with the staff and other committee members of the Migrant Resource Centre.

In some instances, the standards of management of those organisations do not justify the Commonwealth resources that are provided to them. Without wanting to refer specifically to the organisation he mentioned, about which I have no personal knowledge, I can say that there are sadly many instances throughout the community where factional groups and arguments prevent organisations from carrying out the purpose for which they received the Commonwealth grant.

The $20,000 on a per electorate basis in some sense sounds fair, although it does tend to concentrate the amount of money available in the capital cities where there are a lot of federal electorates and where there will therefore be very large budgets to spend on appropriate commemorations. I have to spread that $20,000 amongst 50 separate towns in my electorate. It is obviously not going to go all the way around. I would very much like to see larger allocations being given to rural, regional and provincial areas. I have probably 20 different RSL branches within my electorate, so sadly the $20,000 will not go around.

I know that comes from a different budget from that of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Sadly, the defence budget has been depleted so much over recent years that there is a limited capacity to do what I think should be done in 1995 to help commemorate Australia Remembers. Many organisations would like to have defence personnel present to help add prestige and a military dimension to their proposed celebrations. In Kingaroy, which is in my electorate, there is a proposal to have an air pageant to commemorate VE day and to particularly mark the role played by Kingaroy in air force training and the activities of the air force during World War II.

The government recently announced new initiatives to assist Vietnam veterans in Australia. I was very disturbed to learn from counsellors who participated in the Vietnam veterans country outreach program that the government is about to axe the program. This seems to be an extraordinary action on the part of the government on the eve of the Australia Remembers commemoration in light of the commitments made by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I am sure in all sincerity, to do more to assist Vietnam veterans.

That is not an enormous commitment from the government, but it seems that the government wants this service to become voluntary. This is a very stressful occupation. It is stressful not only for the counsellors themselves, some of whom are from families of Vietnam veterans, but also for the immediate families of the counsellors because the veterans call in at all hours and the counsellors are called out at all hours. It places a burden on their families.

The government wants these counsellors to perform this highly skilled and very stressful task without any reimbursement. Frankly, that is unreasonable.

         My final point in the area of veterans affairs relates to the Australia Remembers commemoration. There has been a lot of pressure within my electorate—and I am sure in other places as well—for a public holiday to commemorate VP Day. That is a day of great significance for Australia. It was a day of great celebration 50 years ago; it was a public holiday 50 years ago. It would certainly add greatly to the public's acknowledgment of that day if there were a holiday for VP Day again in 1995.

         I know that employers and businesses are reluctant to have more holidays. We certainly have plenty of them in this country, and more than most. Why not in this very special year transfer, say, the Labour Day holiday—a holiday which is celebrated on various days around Australia—to VP Day to mark a very significant event? If the labour movement is reluctant to give away its holiday for one year, perhaps the Queen's Birthday holiday could for one year be on this day to recognise this important event. If that day is not suitable, there are many show days or pupil free days in schools that could surely be transferred to VP Day to help local communities better celebrate this important event.

         Whilst dealing with defence matters, I note also that, despite the fact that we have a hard pressed defence budget and a white paper currently before the parliament which slashes defence expenditure to the lowest level since World War II, the Department of Defence is still going to have to find around $10 million to redecorate the Prime Minister's jet. It seems an extraordinary priority, when we cannot find money to adequately staff the defence battalions and we cannot find money for new equipment, that $10 million is going to have to be found to upgrade the Prime Minister's 707 jet because, apparently, it does not meet his imperial standards.

But even without increasing existing taxes specifically, the government still budgeted on an income tax increase of 8.4 per cent; 5.7 per cent more from the Medicare levy; seven per cent increase in company tax; 27 per cent increase in super funds taxes; and a fringe benefits tax increase of an incredible 131 per cent—all of that without any increases in tax. Sales taxes went up by 7.7 per cent, fuel excise went up by 12.6 per cent and there was a 6.3 per cent increase in other excises. The government reaped that tax windfall without increasing taxes.

         There is no excuse whatsoever for higher taxes. There are plenty of excuses for the government to cut its own expenditure and to cut its own waste. Sadly, in this appropriation bill we are allocating more money for more government waste. There are so many examples of where the government has failed to cut its own budget and where it has failed to draw in its own expenditure. It prefers instead to raise levels of taxes to penalise ordinary Australians, the people who are trying to get their businesses up and running again. Not only do they slave and struggle under increasing government regulation and higher charges and taxes, but they are also never rewarded for their effort. Their reward for higher profitability, for putting in those extra hours, is more taxes.

         As our economy improves, the government should recognise that that improvement is directly the result of the individual efforts of Australian small business and industry. It has nothing to do with any brainstorm on behalf of the Prime Minister or any intervention on the government's part. It is entirely due to the efforts of individual Australians. Those efforts should be rewarded, encouraged and acknowledged—not penalised through higher taxes. The government needs to take that into account in proposing its mini-budget early next year and in its future budgetary planning.

         —As we go through the decade of the 1990s and approach the centenary of Federation, it is appropriate to reflect upon the events of 100 years ago and on how it was that we came to have our constitution, which remains relatively unchanged—very similar to the original document. We should remember that the Australian constitution had its legal entity created with the enactment of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900, enacted by the British parliament. The simple fact is that the act had nine clauses with the ninth clause commencing by saying:

        Our constitution was created as a clause of an act of the British parliament. It is very difficult to imagine in the 1990s how we would go about putting in place a constitution to create the federation of Australia. It is a bit hard to imagine being in the situation of the British parliament, being required to achieve the outcome. That is not to say that we do not need to look at contemporary Australia and to think about those things that are made more difficult because of the constitution being created in the 1890s.

         One of the increasing frustrations that I have as a member of the Australian parliament is that often the things we would like to achieve are frustrated, or made more complicated, because of the need to wend our way through the sensitivities of Commonwealth-state relations. I see the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) at the table. We have a debate at the moment about national competition policy. It is a quite complex and complicated policy on its own without having the difficulties of looking at it in the context of agreements between the Commonwealth and the states. I raise that as one example because I believe there has not been sufficient debate about competition policy arising out of the Hilmer report and that there is perhaps a lack of understanding of its ramifications. When people investigate those ramifications, it becomes even more difficult because it is hard to identify what means will be used to achieve outcomes.

The first part of the article was critical of the Prime Minister for the way in which he has assessed what happened in that important time in our history. I believe that was a little unfair. I will go to the latter parts of his article where he says:

         If we look at some of the pamphlets circulated during the run-up to federation, we see one that compared the proposed constitution with the then fledgling Swiss and American constitutions. This pamphlet made the bold claim that it would be easier, under the proposed Australian constitution, to achieve constitutional change than it would be under the American constitution. I think the history of the past century—in the case of the American constitution, a greatly longer period—proves that the American constitution has proved in its ability to be amended a much more pliable document that can be changed to represent contemporary ideas and views.

         The problems that have been created by this inflexibility and lack of change within the Australian constitution are well known. Earlier I gave some examples, but perhaps the situation was best summarised by a graphic illustration given by then Prime Minister Bob Hawke in 1990. Mr Hawke gave the example of a cargo container being sent by rail between Sydney and Perth that may have been subject to three non-integrated railway systems, four changes in locomotives, five different safe working systems, six different sizes of loading gauge, 10 different engineering standards of basic standard gauge rail track and 12 or more hours at sidings or junctions for crew changes.

Arising out of an Industry Commission report on accident compensation, at the level of COAG we will look at those issues, at our separate jurisdictions, because those matters reside within the powers that were reserved by the colonies back in the 1990s, and at the way in which we can put in place a national policy.

         As Richard White said, the founding fathers, whom I quoted earlier, were often regarded with undue reverence. Back in the 1970s, Don Dunstan pointed out that they were really little more than state politicians protecting vested interests. What we need to do is to ask how, in the 1990s, we can wind back the clock and how we can wind back those attitudes that were motivated by these vested interests so that we can achieve change that focuses on looking at Australia as one nation, rather than looking at Australia as a continuing collection of the six colonies.

         We should realise that the founding fathers knew well that they were condemning future generations. Manning Clark pointed out in his history of Australia that as early as the late 1840s the Whig Earl Grey warned the colonists about the dangers of separate parliaments `legislating on such subjects of common interest as railway gauges'. Clark continues:

        At the time of Federation, those issues were not immediately or magically addressed because of the creation of the federation or the way the constitution was framed. It has taken us progressively over the last century to be able to address the problems that the earlier colonial decisions created. I think it is worth repeating a quote of Don Dunstan: We are now left with results of their work—

And as the years pass the writing of the Constitution becomes enveloped in the mists of time, that well known contagion of Federated States can be seen developing high-minded reverence for the Founding Fathers. Any criticism of their document becomes a kind of political blasphemy. They are even now being seen as far-sighted, despite the fact that when they drew the document up about the only matters they considered crucial to national Government were defence, an end to custom barriers and an efficient post office . . .

        One of the driving forces that moved politicians in the six colonies to agitate for federation was the influence of the French and the Germans in their efforts to colonise our region. For others, it was the concern that they had of either Asian invasion or Asian takeover through migration. In the 1990s we are having debates about free trade throughout the world and, in particular, yesterday's debate arising from the APEC meeting in Bogor about free trade in our region. In that context it is interesting that one of the driving forces for the colonies in getting together to create the Federation was free trade between the colonies.

         So where does that leave us at the moment? It leaves us in a situation whereby, through COAG as a meeting of heads of governments, we are trying to achieve a cooperative approach to the way in which we can tackle the problems that confront Australia. Because of what is sometimes termed `the new federalism', whereby we have to achieve national policies through the agreement of both the national and state governments and national and state legislatures, a great degree of compromise is needed to achieve outcomes. Without suggesting that consultation in any form is a bad thing, to achieve this cooperation—to do it right—requires lengthy consultation, which delays our ability to put in place change and delays our ability to address problems at a national level.

         We have slowly come to grips with the fact that, in economic policy terms, only the national government can give the direction.

There is continuing concern where people are conjuring up this concept of states rights without thinking that we should be talking about people's individual rights and the need for a national direction in those areas of policy.

The problem with his line of argument is that it does not actually help the agenda of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for constitutional reform unless the Prime Minister is prepared to accept that becoming a republic should also include abolishing the states. I would think that that is in fact part of the Prime Minister's long-term agenda, but it is certainly not something that he is prepared to admit at the moment. In fact, at the moment the Prime Minister is saying that if the states did not exist it would be necessary to invent them.

         The member for Scullin has fallen into the trap which so many members opposite fall into—namely, in their desire to bring about certain changes to our constitution, they are rubbishing the entire document. The member for Scullin read articles from some academic who was talking of our constitution as `a grubby compromise'. I would have thought that compromise was part of life. Effective life in civil society means knowing when to compromise, because compromise of some sort is simply inevitable. Putting a pejorative adjective in front of the word `compromise' does not change that fact. He may as well have spoken about `grubby cooperation', but of course he would not talk that way because we all know that cooperation is part of life and it is essential if we are going to have the kind of society that people are happy to live in.

         Yes, documents—even documents like the constitution—do need to be changed from time to time. But the changes must address the real needs of the people and not the imaginary needs and the cheap political interests of certain political sections and ideologies in society. The fact is that, if you look at the constitutions which were changed most often in the modern world, you get constitutions like that of the former Soviet Union. That constitution went through five or six incarnations in 70 years. On paper, the constitution of the Soviet Union was the most relevant and up-to-date constitution in the world, but it did not matter at all as far as protecting rights in the Soviet Union was concerned, because there was no cohesive culture—political culture, culture of human rights—behind it. The fact is that, if our constitution needs to change to serve the needs of the Australian people, it must change. But it must not change simply to serve the needs of the Prime Minister.

The Prime Minister said that the APEC agreement permanently changed our region and the world.

The Prime Minister went round this country saying to the workers of the textile industry, the motor industry and the footwear industry, `Vote Labor, because Labor will protect your tariffs.' Now he is saying that within a few short years tariffs will be abolished, not because we in Australia want them to be abolished but because APEC, apparently, is telling us that they should be abolished. The Prime Minister has forgotten in just a short space of time the fundamental plank on which he fought the last election.

In the 1950s the Prime Minister of India Mr Nehru welcomed Australia's coming closer to Asia. So this idea that Asia was only discovered in December 1991, when the current Prime Minister assumed office, is a myth.

This government has practised hairshirt economics. When times were good back in the 1980s, it put interest rates up to 17 per cent. When times were bad in the early 1990s, it put unemployment up to one million people. Now that times are allegedly good again, interest rates are going up again.

Recent DEET figures show that the number of skilled vacancies in major metropolitan newspapers has risen.

Earlier this year, the federal Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) announced intentions to identify and plan for road and rail links between those two airports. He established the task force to work with the New South Wales government.

         The New South Wales Liberal coalition government has not been easy to negotiate with, stipulating its involvement would be dependent on a Commonwealth government commitment to provide up-front funding of both road and rail links, including a $120 million funding commitment towards the city to Kingsford Smith airport rail link. Wanting to secure cooperation, our Commonwealth government attempted, as much as possible, to develop a good working relationship with the New South Wales government over this issue. But the New South Wales government would not agree to the State Rail Authority carrying out the engineering study for the rail link unless the Commonwealth gave a commitment to pay for the lot once again. Even after the Commonwealth made $200,000 available for that rail study, New South Wales continued to baulk at having any involvement in that engineering study. Eventually, the New South Wales Liberal coalition government reluctantly agreed to participate.

         As well, despite receiving millions of dollars from the federal government to improve our national highways, the financial year of 1993-94 saw the New South Wales government divert some $50 million to non-road purposes. If New South Wales continues to divert a considerable proportion of its discretionary spending to consolidated revenue, how can the federal government treat seriously calls from New South Wales to allocate more money for New South Wales roads.

         The recent outcry about noise and low flying aircraft has certainly sparked a new controversy and debate about the opening of a third runway at Sydney's Mascot airport. Eyes will soon turn to developing the proposed airport at Badgerys Creek in Sydney's west. Certainly building the airport at Badgerys Creek has its attractions. It should lead, as I am informed—and statistics back it up—to the creation of thousands of jobs not only in constructing the airport and transport links but also in the companies that will relocate to our area. It also has scope to increase opportunities in the manufacturing and tourism sectors.

         The federal Minister for Transport recently announced that three route options have been identified for the new national highway link between Prestons and Cecil Park in Sydney's west and that an environmental impact study will commence to determine the best route. The Prestons to Cecil Park link is the southernmost of the three sections of the western Sydney orbital. It is proposed that this new road take long-distance heavy vehicles out of Sydney's local and arterial road system and form part of the link from Kingsford Smith airport to Sydney West airport.

But various people now want that $73 million spending to be brought forward to the next calendar year and another $47 million allocated to the FAC dedicated to immediate construction of Badgerys Creek. I have personally written to the federal Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator John Faulkner, outlining in detail my concerns about all aspects of the proposal and its impact on people in my electorate.

         We cannot fast-track construction at Badgerys Creek without an updated full environmental impact statement on the issue. A very detailed EIS was completed in 1985, and I have read it, but many changes have occurred in western Sydney over the nine years since that EIS was completed. The 1985 EIS suggested a runway of 1,200 metres but in 1991—and I am pleased to say following a great deal of pressure from western New South Wales members—the then Minister for Transport changed the length of the runway to something like 1,800-odd metres. Also, following further representation to our federal minister, we have now announced the construction of an international standard 2.9 kilometre runway instead of the 1.8 kilometre general aviation facility that was originally planned for Badgerys Creek.

The new site for the airport is very close to Horsley Park, Bossley Park, Smithfield, Greystanes and Fairfield—all areas and suburbs within the electorate that I represent.

They should particularly give consideration to take-off and landing in the early hours of the morning and the impact it would have on residents' lives. I wonder whether the planners and so-called experts realise the amount of noise generated by aircraft landing or taking off at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. This is what we must give consideration to.

         I certainly sympathise with those people who are affected by the opening of the third runway. But I will say most sincerely that many people purchased properties in that region knowing the airport was there. Certainly, many have known it has been there for many years. Conversely, though, some people within my electorate had never contemplated having an airport in the area, even though now many welcome it—and certainly our council does. Years ago some made an initial choice to live in the quiet rural areas of the electorate and others, who have moved in since the 1975 subdivision started, would not have had any inkling that an airport could be constructed in the area and that they could end up under a flight path. I think that choice has now been taken away from a lot of people. As an article on flight paths, which appeared in last Saturday's

No Australian has won more Commonwealth Games medals, whether they be gold, silver or bronze, than Phillip. He has been a great ambassador for Australia in pistol shooting. Even as recently as yesterday, we had two Narromine athletes performing well for this country. Glenn McGrath plays cricket for Australia. Who could forget seeing, on our television screens last night, that famous inswinger cleaning up one of the English batsmen? Further, when I got back to the motel and turned on the TV, there was Melinda Gainsford winning the indoor 200 metres, beating even as famous a person as Cathy Freeman. But it is not about them that I want to talk today. I wish to talk about cleaning up drugs in sport. The athletes that I have just mentioned have been exemplary in this regard.

         For some time now, the world has been suspicious that China is guilty of using systematic doping to produce artificial world champions, particularly in swimming—though positives have turned up in drug testing of competitors in canoeing, athletics and other sports. If we look at swimming, we see that, of the world's top 25 rankings for each swimming stroke, in 1991 China had six listings; a year later that had increased fourfold to 24 listings; and a year later, in 1993, that had increased fourfold again to 96 listings. Such a meteoric rise in itself is suspicious, particularly as only one of those listings was a male, with the rest being female. The very top performers won six medals at the world's swimming championships in Perth in 1991; but this year, 1994, in September, in Rome at the Foro Italico pool, they won 24 medals. What is particularly notable is that all the medal winners this year were female; in fact, they won 12 of the 16 gold medals, and not one male Chinese swimmer made a final. That in itself causes a suspicion that they may be taking drugs. Only last month in October at the Asian Games in Hiroshima, the women won all 15 gold medals in swimming.

         With this meteoric rise, there has been the very physical evidence, I believe, especially to the trained eye, of the use of drugs, particularly anabolic steroids, the testosterone derivatives, and human growth hormone. Looking at the female Chinese swimmers, we see about them a lot of non-feminine characteristics. There are the deep husky voices of the girls. At the world championships when Lu Bin came in and won the 200 metres freestyle, as well as being a relay competitor, her deep baritone voice apparently shocked the audience, including the 60 journalists, there. She said that she was not on drugs and that these accusations against Chinese female swimmers were racist.

         But, apart from voice, another characteristic is excessive body hair, where it is not shaved, of course—particularly facial hair. Most alarming is the thickening and protrusion of the mandible, the lower jawbone. I guess equally if not more worrying are the characteristics that we do not see, some of which may not turn up for years—damage done to the liver from trying to detoxify the testosterone floating around in these athletes' bodies; the diabetes problems resulting from it; and, later in life, most tragically of all, the infertility problems caused by damage done to the reproductive systems of these girls.

         Throughout all these accusations, the Chinese officials, including government officials, denied that any doping was going on. The athletes themselves have denied that any doping was going on. The accusers have been called racists. Even Juan Antonio Samaranch, the Chairman of the International Olympic Committee, who supported Beijing against Sydney for the 2000 Olympics, dismissed these allegations and declared China `very clean'.

         The pattern that I have outlined amongst Chinese athletes, particularly the swimmers, is all very similar to what the world went through in the 1980s with happenings in East Germany before the Berlin Wall came down. Only in today's December edition of

         , which has just been released in America, there is a very interesting article showing, from the opening up of the Stasi files—the Stasi, of course, being the East German secret police—that every East German world-class swimmer was doped. The evidence is there recorded. The testosterone levels—the male hormone levels—in those German female swimmers were very great indeed.

         Of course, testosterone injected into females accelerates muscle growth and reduces the recovery times between events. A normal male will have about 40 parts per cubic centimetre of urine. There is some testosterone normally in a female but it is about five parts per cubic centimetre. In a normal individual walking around, the ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone—which is the natural preform of testosterone—is one to one. It can rise, abnormally, in exceptional circumstances to three to one. The International Olympic Committee has set a standard ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone at six to one. So, if people test positive to testosterone, there is no doubt that they take the drug.

So the East German swimmers were a total pack of cheats, nothing more and nothing less.

Her test at the world championships turned up clear but she was tested randomly two weeks later, before the Asian Games, and she tested positive. According to one newspaper report, the

         At the Asian Games, something else happened. A surprise test was done on the swimmers three days before the games, not after, and 11 Chinese athletes turned up positive, including eight female swimmers.

         Le Jingyi, who holds the world record, which she set at the world championships, for 50 metres of 24.51 and for 100 metres of 54.01, was excluded from the eight swimmers who turned up positive. She is the girl we have all been seeing on our television sets in recent weeks. She has very broad shoulders which taper down to a narrow waist. She looks like she has swung out of a tree with a gorilla and she would be the envy of every male bodybuilder in the world. She tested negative, but surely there is no doubt that she also is positive. I might just add that testosterone particularly helps the sprinters—and she is a 50-metre and a 100-metre sprinter—because of the bulk they put on. The benefit gained from using testosterone starts to dissipate when you get up to the distance events, such as the 800 metres.

         It appears that the Chinese athletes have been able to avoid testing positive when they have been tested after the competition events because of such devices as flushing, whereby they use diuretics to flush out of the body the urine with the high testosterone in it so that the urine sample taken later is a dilute one. Apparently they have also been using masking drugs, which block the kidneys from excreting testosterone. By using these flushing and masking techniques, the drugs can be flushed out of the system within 48 hours.

         So it is obvious that it is vital to use random testing of athletes and what is called `out of competition' testing of athletes to pick up this use. In the Chinese program, only about 20 per cent of their total testing is out of competition testing whereas in Australia 50 per cent of the tests fall into this category. We need these tests to be done to establish baseline levels for individual athletes.

         When the Chinese were tested, Lu Bin's level was very high indeed. I guess that the testosterone levels floating around in the bodies of Lu Bin and Le Jingyi would probably be equivalent to the level of the combined teams of the Canberra Raiders and the Brisbane Broncos. I say to the world international swimming community—particularly to the Chinese community—that, if they want their female swimmers to look like males, to act like males and to swim like males, they should ban them from the female events and let them compete in the male events.

         I believe that this is a human rights issue. Perhaps it should be taken up by the United Nations and perhaps education programs for female swimmers should be put in place. Yang, the 400-metre swimmer who has turned up positive, trains under Zhou Ming at the Guang Zhou Military Club, along with sprinter Le Jingyi, who won four gold medals and set four world records at the world titles, and the dual backstroke world champion, He Cihong. I would say that there is no doubt—the circumstantial evidence is very heavy indeed—that the coaches know what is going on with these swimmers, even though one of them did not test positive.

         I would stress that it is not just the athletes who take the drugs but those who administer them who are particularly at fault. The Australian stance on coaches who are found administering drugs to athletes is that they should be banned not just for two or four years but for life. I believe that at present the swimmers are banned for only two years. So they can compete at one Olympic Games, be picked up with a positive test, dry out and compete at another Olympic Games. I believe they should be banned for four years, including one Olympic Games, and that all their medals and previous records should be stripped off them when that happens. I also believe that a country with a large number of athletes who test positive should forfeit its right to compete for a number of years until it can show that particular sport is clean to the satisfaction of International Olympic Committee standards.

         —It gives me great pleasure to speak today on the appropriation bills. As most of the honourable members in this House will recognise, appropriation bills are about money and the funding of government programs. A major issue connected with appropriation and state-Commonwealth funding arrangements is that dealt with by Hilmer in looking at national competition policy and through that at the concept of a national electricity grid.

         While people, in principle, support the concept of a national electricity grid, it is a different issue when the power poles required for that grid are to go through their home and affect their livelihood or, more importantly—as the good citizens of Boonah would argue—they are to go through a recognised scenic rim. Over 200 people attended a public meeting in Boonah last week to voice their opposition to the proposed route for the QEC east link. They have formed themselves into a group called the Boonah Citizens Opposed to East Link.

         It befits the government to listen to those community concerns and to evaluate them so that, if the option is chosen to put powerlines through there, the decision is made with all the facts to hand and taking into consideration all the issues that the community has raised. Many of the issues raised at that public meeting had not been brought to the attention of the QEC.

         The area itself is recognised as being part of the scenic rim. It embraces a number of shires and it has changed from a dairying community to a tourism community. That is particularly important. It has nine outdoor education establishments for school children and it is the largest area that provides such facilities in south-east Queensland. Over 10,000 students per year visit this area to participate in outdoor education pursuits.

         Those establishments have chosen this area because of its beauty and because of its access to both the mountains and the water—although, sadly, there is not too much water at the moment.

Yarramalong advertises indoor recreation with privacy, no overcrowding, and horse riding facilities. The national horse trails go through this area. O'Reilly's mountain resort is there.

All of those operations are placed at risk if the QEC east link connection goes through this area. How on earth can people parachute if they are in danger of falling onto powerlines?

All of us have been made very conscious of what is happening with the use of chemicals, particularly in the international meat market. Not only do farmers lose control over their property, but they have no control over what the Queensland Electricity Commission may be doing with chemicals.

They expressed their very precise and very clear objections to the placement of the QEC east link through their area. They object not because they are necessarily opposed to the QEC east link—although people did raise issues as to whether this was necessary, and whether in fact the kind of electricity that would be generated in the link-up would be important—but because, if they are to survive as a community, they need that area to remain pristine. They need that area to remain as part of our heritage in order to develop their livelihoods through tourism, through outdoor education and, indeed, through the kind of farming to which they have now adapted.

This is the appropriate occasion in the House for that kind of activity. The current situation of the economy is a delightful one, as has been said a number of times in the last day or two from this side of the House. The rate of economic growth is measured at 6.4 per cent and even if those figures have to be revised downward, as is possible because it seems extraordinarily rapid, it is quite clear that the economy is now growing very strongly, that the level of economic activity is high and that therefore there will a strong rate of economic growth and a strong rate of employment growth, which is what we all want.

         The principal problem of the Australian economy at present is the level of unemployment. It has fallen significantly from its peak but it is still over 9 per cent, and we want that to come down rapidly and to remain much lower. One of the principal requirements for that is for the level of economic activity to remain strong.

         The rate of inflation is also extraordinarily low. At less than two per cent, less than half the OECD average, that is less than half also the rate amongst our trading partners, and there is no significant sign of that rate of inflation increasing. It is quite clear too that business investment is growing strongly and that there is also strong growth in many exports. Of course, the drought is retarding growth of primary exports, which is a tragedy for the rural sector. The government has a package in place to try to offset that to a limited extent but the drought is containing the growth of the whole economy and, until the drought breaks, we will not see the uniform spread of economic activity that we want to see.

         We all want to avoid increases in interest rates and taxation but, on the other hand, it is crucial to ensure that this recovery, this strong period of economic growth, is sustainable.

         Many people, particularly from the financial markets, have been arguing that interest rates should be increased yet again. I think they neglect the fact that, since the September quarter increase in the national accounts, there have already been two increases in interest rates, increases totalling one and 3/4per cent, the most recent of which was towards the end of October. It is quite clear that those increases would not have made any impact at all on the activity in the September quarter, and it is therefore appropriate to wait awhile before any further decision is made on interest rates.

         Some of the commentary from the financial markets suggests that the government and the Reserve Bank should act as if what is happening at this very moment, the beginning of December, is what was measured for the September quarter. That is an oversimplification. It is highly likely that the growth rate will remain strong now, but it may be somewhat less than it was measured to be in the September quarter, because of the impact of those two interest rate increases. It is quite clear, for example, that housing activity is already tailing off a bit. I know, from anecdotal evidence, of business people who have deferred investments that they were planning, because of the two increases in interest rates that have already occurred, and because they fear that there may be more in the pipeline and they fear the cost that those increases would cause them if they were to invest further now.

         I think responsible policy would suggest that there should not be any further increases in interest rates for some time, until it is possible to accurately and comprehensively evaluate the impact of the two increases in interest rates that have already occurred, and the consequences of that impact for every part of the economy. It is important to do that, of course, in ways that take account not only of statistics but also of the evidence that comes from the business sector, the housing sector and the consumer sector, in so far as that can be assessed. Of course, since the Christmas period is always a period of very rapid activity—a turbulent period, if you like, in measured terms—it would be wise to leave further decisions until late January or February.

         It is good to see that the Reserve Bank has today decided not to announce any further increase. I hope that it will take no further action for at least a couple of months. One would hope that it would then find that further increases were not necessary. We want to avoid interest increases in so far as we possibly can, because they increase the cost of investment and they increase the cost to home buyers and buyers of white goods and cars, and we want the level of economic activity to remain as strong as is possible. One of the lessons of the last decade was that interest increases can be very damaging. That is the lesson, not only from Australia but also from other countries.

         Therefore, we want to be quite cautious about any increases that occur. The fact that increases are happening in the United States does not mean that they are appropriate policy here, not least because real interest rates in Australia are already—still—well above those in the United States, despite the fact that there have been half a dozen increases there. Because our inflation rate is so low, the real level of interest here is still high, by historical standards and by international standards. We ought to remember that.

         As well, we need to remember that when interest rates rise the exchange rate rises. That has happened in the months that have followed the increases in interest rates here.

         Of course, we have to find ways of containing demand. It seems entirely appropriate for the government to be seriously thinking about very modest, progressive increases in taxation. It is something new in the Australian environment, since the last decade and a half, for there to be serious consideration of what should be done about taxation. During the last decade we had a whole series of reductions in taxation, which were no doubt widely welcomed. But it is responsible, as the Treasurer said yesterday, to use taxation, as well as monetary policy and policy about outlays, as countercyclical policy.

         The question then for the government is how to do that. All of us would have our appropriate suggestions to make, but I would want to emphasise that the changes should be carefully targeted and should be progressive. In other words, they should be imposed on areas where people can more readily afford them; in other words, they should be imposed on high income earners rather than low income earners or middle income earners or perhaps on certain areas in the business sector where they will not discourage investment.

         Such areas are available. Let me mention just a couple. A very obvious area would be to halve dividend imputation. Australia is, I am told, perhaps the only country, but at the very least one of the few countries, with 100 per cent dividend imputation. Most countries in the OECD have half dividend imputation. That is a benefit, of course, only to those who own shares. By definition, that is principally those who are on upper incomes or the more wealthy. To halve dividend imputation would still give them some of the benefit of that policy but it would save about $900 million in revenue forgone. That would be an equitable measure. It would bring us into line with a lot of the rest of the Western world, and it would not discourage the purchase of shares. I think that that is a very serious possibility that ought to be considered.

         Another course which many people mention would be to do away with negative gearing. That too is a tax policy that is of benefit to those who are by definition relatively well off, who can benefit from the effect of their assets on their net income. I think a lot of people judge that abolition of negative gearing would be a progressive policy. Another possibility would be changes to some of the tax treatment of superannuation, particularly for very high income earners.

         Other possibilities are available but those ones would be quite well targeted. They would be progressive policies which would not discourage investment, which would bring us into line with much of the rest of the Western world, which would not be discriminatory and which would be paid for by those who can most readily afford them. It is important to consider those possibilities, as well as the possibility of perhaps a higher marginal rate for people on over $70,000. There is nothing sacrosanct about the upper limit at present of $50,000. That too would make the income tax system rather more progressive.

         I conclude by repeating that what is happening at present is in large measure the result of sound policy over the last few years. The economy is now growing strongly. The problems are the delightful ones of a strong recovery. The issues for the government are how to ensure that that recovery can be sustained so that employment can go on growing in the ways that we all want. Employment growth will occur mainly in the service sector, and a lot of it in the human service sector. To build up the revenue base allows some of that growth of employment to be in the area of publicly provided human services like education and health, areas where there are desperate needs for improvement.

         The example that seems to me to be most powerful is that at the beginning of this year 140,000 people who applied to go to technical and further education colleges were not able to find places. Therefore, it is a very high priority to build up the number of places available so that those people can get the skills that they need for the working life that they want and so that Australia can have the benefit of a more skilled work force.

         For some of the additional revenue to be used for improvements in the number of TAFE places would be welcomed very widely in the community. Since TAFEs are the most widely underfunded areas of education, I think that is one of the highest priorities for use of any additional revenue that is available. No doubt, some of the additional revenue would rightly be used for reducing the deficit. It should also be used in ways that will maximise growth of employment, and the TAFE sector is a particularly good example. I conclude by reiterating the centrality of the employment goal and the need to ensure sustainable economic development in ways that will also include increased equity, which would in turn contribute to making the economy more humane and sustainable.

        This bill, together with the two others that are part of the same package, is to replace the Audit Act 1901. That act is one of the few Commonwealth laws that have operated continuously since they were passed by this parliament in its first session after federation. Its intended replacement, therefore, represents something of a landmark in the history of Commonwealth financial administration. The Audit Act is not being replaced simply because it is old. In fact, it has proved remarkably robust over its 93-year life in providing for the procedural framework for Commonwealth financial administration and for the audit of the Commonwealth's activities. But too many of its basic concepts and structures reflect their 19th century origins to an extent that ignores and in some cases even impedes modern management practice and contemporary expectations for public sector accountability.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         These limitations were recognised by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in the course of its comprehensive inquiry into the operations of the Audit Office. In its report 296, tabled in April 1989, the JCPA recommended that the Audit Act be replaced with more modern legislation, with separate acts to deal with auditing and financial administration. In giving effect to that recommendation, the government believes that clarity would be served best through the adoption of three new acts. It is proposed that there be an Auditor-General Act to provide for the powers and functions of the Auditor-General. In relation to financial administration, however, Commonwealth bodies differ according to the basic legal financial status that each one has—namely, whether the body has the legal capacity, in its own right, to acquire ownership of money and other assets coming into its possession, or whether it acts only as a financial and custodial agent for the Commonwealth, without acquiring separate legal ownership of such money and assets.

         Consequently, it is proposed that there be a Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act to specify certain matters that are to apply to the operations of financially autonomous bodies—that is, Commonwealth bodies that have legal ownership of money in their own right; and a Financial Management and Accountability Act, to apply to the financial operations of agencies—that is, Commonwealth bodies that financially are agents of the Commonwealth in that the bodies acquire no legal ownership of the money that they raise and spend. That money, in the constitutional sense, directly comprises the `Treasury of the Commonwealth'.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, you may recall that, upon introduction of the package of these three bills on 29 June 1994, the House agreed that the legislative package be referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for its consideration and advisory report. JCPA report 331 tabled on 22 September 1994 is the result of that process. I believe that the committee is to be commended for its quality analysis and recommendations, the great majority of which the government accepts. In that regard, I foreshadow that the government will be moving a number of amendments to the bills to pick up the recommendations of the JCPA accepted by the government, together with several other minor changes the desirability for which became evident as a consequence of reviewing the bills to address the JCPA's examination.

         I now wish to provide an outline of the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act. The proposed act is concerned with the regulatory-accounting-accountability framework for dealing with and managing the money and property of the Commonwealth. It will specify responsibilities and powers necessary for the efficient, effective and ethical use of the resources lawfully available to the Commonwealth to carry out its programs; and it will provide appropriate mechanisms to ensure that the stewardship and management performance of those who are responsible for those resources can be made visible and thereby allow them to be held accountable. The proposed law will add substance to the spirit of the public sector financial reforms that have been a feature of this government's administration over the last decade. At the same time, the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act is intended to preserve the traditional strengths of the Audit Act's key principles of financial control and, where possible, to clarify and simplify them.

         The explanatory memorandum accompanying this bill deals comprehensively with its features. There are, however, a few elements that I would like to mention specifically. The definitions of `Agency', `Chief Executive', `official', `public money' and `public property', between them, describe the proposed boundaries of the act's application. Within those boundaries, the principles set down in the act will be fleshed out, where necessary, by subsidiary legislation—regulations and finance minister's orders—to provide procedural substance for the day-to-day application of those principles. Such a legislative framework is patterned on the structure established by the Audit Act for regulations and finance directions, except that, unlike finance directions, which are administrative in character, provision is made for finance minister's orders to be tabled as disallowable instruments. The legislative framework will be completed by instructions which chief executives will be authorised to issue to officials of their agencies.

         The act will preserve the unique role of the Minister for Finance, which is central to the orderly functioning of the Commonwealth's financial administration. The finance minister is, for all practical purposes, the custodian of the constitutional `Treasury of the Commonwealth' so that the range of statutory powers and responsibilities for the proper custody of the Commonwealth's money is vested in that office. The finance minister will retain the sole power to agree appropriate banking arrangements for public money and to make orders concerning the handling of receipts and withdrawals of public money and its investment. The existing power under the Audit Act to arrange overdrafts and advances from banks has been clarified to specifically limit such arrangements as short-term cash management tools—overdrafts on operational bank accounts for up to 30 days; borrowings from banks as advances paid to the Commonwealth for up to 90 days; and other types of credit arrangements, to be prescribed by the regulations, such as those represented by credit card and cabcharge transactions, for up to 60 days. It should be noted that these arrangements confer no power for the Commonwealth to spend otherwise than as authorised by parliament through appropriations.

         One of the most visible changes to be brought about by the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act is in relation to the accounting classifications of money in the Commonwealth's possession. The trust fund established by section 60 of the Audit Act is to be abolished and replaced by two purpose based funds—the reserved money fund and the commercial activities fund. Apart from components of the reserved money fund that may be established pursuant to other enactments, the components of these two funds will be established or varied by finance minister's determinations. The effect of such determinations will be to specify the kinds of money that may be drawn from the consolidated revenue fund or loan fund and credited to the particular component and the purposes on which that money may then be spent.

         Since the spending of money from such a fund is in all respects an appropriation, the proposed act will require that these determinations by the finance minister be tabled as disallowable instruments that do not take effect until the period for disallowance has passed.

         Payments of public money, including debiting a fund against an appropriation, will be controlled by a system of `drawing rights', to be issued by the finance minister. This system is predicated on the fact that the laws made by parliament relating to appropriations, variously compelling or permitting the executive government to spend, always specify the fund being appropriated and the purpose of the spending. Such laws may also specify an amount and a time frame. It would be a breach of section 83 of the constitution for spending to occur in any instance outside of those parameters, so the act will stipulate that the finance minister has no capacity to issue valid drawing rights that are inconsistent with the terms of the relevant appropriation law and will make it an indictable offence for an official or minister to knowingly spend, or seek to spend, otherwise than in accordance with a valid drawing right.

         The present Audit Act is generally silent on matters of management performance. The new act seeks to remedy this through particular responsibilities being expressly placed on chief executives of agencies for which they may then be held accountable. They are to be required to manage the affairs of their agencies efficiently, effectively and ethically to the extent allowed by law. They will also be required to implement fraud control plans and establish audit committees. The accountability mechanisms to mesh with these responsibilities will include powers of the finance minister to obtain financial statements and other reports more frequently than annually from agencies.

         Importantly, it is proposed that chief executives be permitted to subdelegate to officials any of the act's finance minister's powers or functions, unless the minister has imposed a restriction prohibiting or limiting such subdelegation. These arrangements for subdelegating are intended to achieve a major strengthening in the financial framework. Chief executives are better placed than the finance minister to manage, to monitor and to control the activities of those officials who perform the delegated tasks. It will thus be practicable to hold chief executives accountable to the finance minister in these respects, whereas it is currently quite impracticable to do so under the existing Audit Act's delegation structures where thousands of individual officials are directly delegated by the finance minister. The government believes that this proposed law represents a significant landmark in sharpening and strengthening the framework of Commonwealth financial administration.

Performance audits are an extra feature on the accountability landscape peculiar to public sector bodies.

         The Financial Management and Accountability Bill provides stringent new requirements for the handling of Commonwealth funds. Its scope covers the underlying principles that are to govern the activities of persons in organisations that financially are agents of the Commonwealth. The fundamental principles of financial control contained in the Audit Act 1901 have been incorporated in these bills. This bill is intended to improve the quality and clarity of understanding of the Commonwealth financial management framework and to sharpen accountability for financial management performance. This, again, is entirely appropriate.

The Audit Act, which we are now in the process of replacing, was the fourth item of legislation enacted by the new Commonwealth government back in 1901.

         The basic reason for this legislation is that the present act, that act which has persisted with amendments since 1901, has become increasingly less able to accommodate the needs and the realities of the modern public sector. This inadequacy was recognised in the 1989 report of the Public Accounts Committee on the Auditor-General. That report recommended that the act be repealed and replaced with legislation which was more in tune with present day realities, which was more effective in addressing their needs and which allowed greater flexibility in the financial management of public sector operations. The government accepted that recommendation. This legislation is the result.

         That recommendation has been picked up in new standing order 217A. That particular provision provides a more effective mechanism by which legislation can be referred to committees. Since that special provision was made a number of bills have been referred to committees. For example, on 4 May a bill was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, on 11 May a bill was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, on 7 June a bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, on 29 June this package of three bills was referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and on 25 August the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) referred the Employment Services Bill 1994 to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.

         As a result, what we have done is introduce, where necessary and appropriate, a new process into the legislative continuum—the initiation of legislation, the preparation of legislation, the work of Parliamentary Counsel, the political party processes, cabinet consideration and so on. Another stage has been introduced as a result of these changes. I referred to this earlier when I said I welcomed and applauded the change. I think it has been a very desirable change. The effectiveness of that process is reflected not only in the very effective way in which the Public Accounts Committee gave consideration to these three bills but also in the quality of report which it brought down and now, the final stage in this process, the fact that the government has responded favourably to so many of the proposals.

         I mentioned that the opposition was taking up some of the particular items of the Public Accounts Committee report in connection with what it had identified as some of the more important elements of the legislation. Certainly as far as the Auditor-General legislation was concerned, I would agree that they are some of the more significant. The particular recommendations from the Public Accounts Committee report that are picked up in these issues are recommendations 19 and 20, both of which are concerned with the capacity of the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits of GBEs.

         The provision the government has is that the performance audits be undertaken by the Auditor-General in two circumstances: first, if there is a request made by the responsible minister; or, second, if there is a resolution of both houses of parliament. I do not believe that is unduly restrictive. I do not think there would be any difficulty, in the case of a good relationship existing between the Minister for Finance and the Auditor-General, as there should be, with the Auditor-General, if he or she were to become aware of any inadequacies which would appear to justify a performance audit, having some discussion with the responsible minister in connection with any other government authority, agency or entity and seeking that request.

If in a situation of that kind it became apparent to the Auditor-General that some sort of performance audit was necessary or desirable and a request was made to the minister for the request to go back to the Auditor-General, the minister would need good grounds to knock that back. The whole question of public accountability and public transparency in relation to issues of that kind indicates that any minister who sought to refuse a request of that kind would be very foolish indeed if the grounds for the request were clearly sufficient.

We as parliamentarians have a responsibility to our electors to see that ministers and their departments administer funds properly.

         On those two grounds, I think this is an important report and an important response. The government has failed to fully demonstrate its understanding of the need for an independent audit office and of the role of the Public Accounts Committee. If the Public Accounts Committee and the auditor are used properly, they are great tools for governments to be able to disclose misallocation of funds and inappropriate administration. It is a strengthening tool for government to be able to use the Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Committee. No minister should be ashamed of sending something off to the Auditor-General, because that enables the electorate to gain confidence that the right thing is being done. So I cannot understand why the minister is chary about pursuing the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee.

Let me outline some of the problems that the member disclosed in his speech where he sought to say, `The committee is right but I am going to support the government.' Recommendation No. 33 of the committee says that before making a recommendation to the Governor-General the minister must seek the approval of the following: the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives or his or her nominee, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and an audit committee of the parliament. That is a reasonable thing.

         That is a very sensible recommendation endorsed by all parties. It goes to the nub, the very reason, of why we have an independent auditor. Here we have carried it one step further so that the parliament can agree through the political processes to the name of that person. That is one of the processes the government has chosen to reject. Is it because there is a difference of opinion between Mr Taylor and the Minister for Finance, or the Department of Finance? Is it because the minister himself has decided that he does not want an independent auditor, that he wants to be able to put his finger upon the person who becomes the Auditor-General? Is that the reason why the minister will not agree to the committee's recommendations? Why has the minister chosen to ignore this recommendation?

Finally, I believe the opposition's proposal is a strengthening of the committee's recommendation to ensure that the auditor has the right to conduct an audit of the government business instrumentalities at any time of his choosing. I have given the example of the Child Support Agency. Another example is the Australian National Line, where the Auditor-General ought to have the right to move in, select and take up an audit that he thinks needs doing on the efficiency of the operations of a government instrumentality. I notice that the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has just come into the chamber. How could anyone rely upon him to send a reference to the auditor for the administration of the ANL, the CAA or any of those bodies that he is responsible for? He would never do it. The auditor ought to have the right to move in on the minister and say, `Laurie, you are blowing it. I am going to have a look at your stuff and see whether or not your agencies are doing the right thing.'

Minister, did you read and initial on 28 July of this year a private briefing note from your department which stated that local residents and councillors to the north of Sydney airport were `substantially underestimating the expected increases in aircraft movements over their suburbs'? Did the same briefing note say that there would, in fact, be a fourfold increase in take-offs over suburbs to the north following the opening of the third runway at Sydney airport and a 140 per cent increase in overall traffic?  Why did you conceal this from Marrickville councillors when you met them on that same day?  Is it not a fact that when it comes to aircraft noise you have conned the people of Sydney?

         With regard to valuations of ANL, which was the central matter in Mr Bolitho's statements, the report makes clear the different bases for the various figures that have been bandied about. The report clearly states that the financial statements, such as ANL's 1992-93 accounts, do not purport to be a valuation of the company and the amount shown as equity does not purport to be an indication of the net value of the entity.

         The key finding of the report is that `there is no necessary inconsistency between the audited 1992-93 financial statements and the August 1994 Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers report', which hardly supports Mr Bolitho's views. Mr Bolitho has also artificially set ANAO's confirmation that ANL was a going concern for the purpose of its 1992-93 accounts against the negative valuation put on it by Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers.

         That misses these very important points. The ANAO states that financial statements prepared on a going concern basis do not purport to be the actual value of the entity at that point in time, even as a going concern. The audit office assessment of a going concern was largely predicated on an undrawn credit facility of $75 million, which was underpinned by a perception of government support: that is, government ownership was crucial in the positive book value of ANL.

         The Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers had a very different starting point. They started from the premise that the government wished to sell a substantial part of ANL. Based on their extensive consideration of a number of factors, including ANL's operating environment, poor operating performance and forecasts, they took the view that even if the government resumed a net debt of $180 million of ANL, as would most likely be required by any prospective purchaser, a partial or total trade sale or flotation of ANL was not viable in view of the fact that, even without financing costs, ANL's prospects were bleak.

Will he admit that his decision has reduced the capacity of Mascot from 64 movements per hour to 50 movements per hour, while at the same time increasing aircraft noise to intolerable levels for those under the flight paths?

That said, the fact is that one must feel very intensely for the 95,000 or so people who are at the moment experiencing the impact of the construction of the parallel runway. It is for that reason that cabinet will be considering, in the next day or so, a range of measures to tackle the question of alleviating this nuisance.

         It may be appropriate if I indicate to the House the sequence of events in respect of the timing of the opening of the parallel runway. On 1 February, which was right at the very start of my time as Minister for Transport, I wrote to the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority seeking advice on the best means to further improve safety at Sydney airport. I did so, against the backdrop of real concerns that had been expressed about the simops arrangements at Kingsford Smith—that is, the simultaneous take-offs and landings arrangements—which, of course, from a safety point of view, are not as optimum as parallel runways. That letter was prompted by concerns that had been put to me about the relative safety of simultaneous runway operations being used at that time in comparison with other possible methods of operating the airport. The Civil Aviation Authority wrote back to me on 15 February proposing a phased introduction of operations on the new parallel runway system to take advantage of the expected early completion of the new runway by the Federal Airports Corporation.

         In that advice to me on 15 February, the Civil Aviation Authority advised that operations could commence as early as September 1994, which is when it anticipated the new runway would be completed, by controlling traffic from the existing control tower, although there would be an initial slight fall in peak hour capacity. With the use of parallel runways, Sydney airport no longer requires the extensive use of simultaneous runway operations. Therefore, an already safe airport becomes that much safer.

         That was the backdrop to the timing of the opening. On the interim basis of the runway, the operations have very little impact as far as noise nuisance is concerned for the most affected people—the residents living in the corridor to the north of the airport—who are bearing the burden of the increased traffic. They bear that burden because, in the last month since operations commenced, some 30 plus per cent of take-offs have been to the north as a result of prevailing winds.

         When the wind blows at more than five knots apparent north, for safety considerations, planes need to take-off into that wind. Some planes can handle it better than others, but the fact is that the airport has to revert to northern take-offs to suit some classes of planes, and that of necessity means that all planes have to take-off to the north in those circumstances. That has resulted in a very real impact.

         That is no different from the impact that will exist when the new tower opens in February or March next year. In respect of the new parallel runway, there are no take-offs to the north under the environmental impact statement. We are now seeing take-offs to the north, which is a noise nuisance factor of about double that of landings, principally brought on by the wind considerations at Kingsford Smith. That will not change at all.

         That somehow people are being exposed to greater noise nuisance than they should as a result of the airport being opened before the control tower is a total furphy. The fact is that a lot of planes have deviated from the flight paths in the last month. Lots of concerns have been very gravely expressed about the number of take-offs to the north, which is the very issue that cabinet will be addressing in the next day or so.

         On the first five days of operations of the new airport arrangements after the parallel runway was opened, because of exceptional westerly winds which prevailed in Sydney and, indeed, right across New South Wales at that time, the east-west runway was used exclusively. For those first five days, the burden of noise was overwhelmingly carried by people in the east-west corridor. That will be the case whenever that runway is required for operational reasons.

         Having said that, it needs to be understood that in those circumstances only one runway is being operated, and operating one runway drops the capacity of the airport down to 30 to 40 take-offs and landings per hour. The big problem facing Kingsford Smith airport at the moment is the tremendous expansion in demand for its services during the peak periods.

         It has been stated by the Civil Aviation Authority that, between February and November this year, the demand for take-offs and landings at Kingsford Smith airport during the peak hours on the peak days has gone up by 50 per cent. With that unbridled demand in the peak hours on the peak days, the whole of the additional capacity at Kingsford Smith will readily be swamped. Indeed, there will be very extensive queuing and circling when the east-west runway is the only runway available as a result of safety considerations brought on by wind factors.

         For all of these reasons, the parallel runway at Kingsford Smith, as a result of the opening of which we have already seen volumes return almost to those of previous operations—that is, it is back up to over 61 take-offs and landings per hour—is operating satisfactorily and safely, but we need to, and we intend to, very seriously tackle this issue of noise nuisance, which is the subject of such grave concern for all people living under the flight corridor.

         —I thank the honourable member for Paterson for his question. Indeed, very good progress has been made. Today I have been informed that next week South Australia will move to fast-track award by award the training wage in that state. The House would be aware that, under the federal system, the national training wage was ratified by the federal commission as far back as 4 September. But what has been required is a mirroring of it in the states. With the South Australian operation in place, we will have effectively mirrored it in the states of South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. Tasmania has also legislated to give effect to it. This leaves Western Australia alone in not taking steps to secure the wage.

         The training wage that we have introduced is not the cut-price, punitive, training-in-name-only wage that was proposed by the opposition at the last election. This is a genuinely award based rate. It is linked to a national training framework. It is industry responsive and supported by industry. I also remind the House that, whatever uncertainty people might think surrounds wages in the current environment, there is no uncertainty under the training wage because these rates have been set for 12 months. Anyone taken on under a traineeship arrangement incorporating the training wage is exempt from the unfair dismissal provisions of the IR act.

        Not only is this commitment a recognition and an endorsement by the employers and the ACTU; it also builds on what is already happening. I simply say to the House that it is only this government that could secure such a partnership of commitment because it is prepared to deal sensibly with both sides of the industrial fence and to secure agreements that commit and that work. I am confident that with this new commitment today we will see important continuing progress being made in the coming year in getting the level of unemployment down.

         —I thank the honourable member for her question. It is the case, as members will know, that each year there is a range of discussions between Papua New Guinean and Australian ministers, generally involving half a dozen ministers from each side, alternately in Papua New Guinea and in Australia. That annual PNG-Australia Ministerial Forum took place in Melbourne last Thursday and Friday. Among the wide range of matters discussed was the future of our aid program. That is a very important strand of our relationship with PNG and, given the crucial economic problems—I think it is fair to describe them in that way—PNG is facing, it was a very timely discussion.

         We on the Australian side take the view that, in view of the fiscal and foreign exchange problems PNG is facing, which have led to the floating of the currency in PNG, amongst other things, there is simply no alternative to the PNG government negotiating and, importantly, then implementing a reform package with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. We think that should take place as soon as possible. Indeed, during those meetings we had assurances that the discussions with the World Bank would continue in January.

         In that context, an international support package is being talked about, but the figure—I see there were some references in the reports, which the honourable member referred to, to a figure—is still something that needs to be assessed. We made the point very firmly that any Australian support for an economic reform package to Papua New Guinea is dependent on Papua New Guinea negotiating a satisfactory agreement with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and, as well as that, on Papua New Guinea itself undertaking significant economic reforms. Two of those reforms are improving its own collection of revenue and increasing public investment from its budget. I emphasise that Australia's participation in that package would be most unlikely to involve any new or additional aid to Papua New Guinea, over and above the amounts which we are committed to supplying under the treaty.

         As far as our current aid program to Papua New Guinea is concerned, things are going well. Our budget support is being progressively replaced with much needed public investment programs, particularly in the areas nominated by Papua New Guinea of infrastructure, health and education. We also agreed during the discussions with Papua New Guinea that there would be full transparency in how those aid programs were progressing and that we would find ways of increasing the flow of public information. It was agreed that the review of the treaty of development cooperation, due to be conducted in September 1995, would proceed and that that review would consider matters including Papua New Guinea's economic situation, the implications of the World Bank-International Monetary Fund adjustment programs and progress in implementing Australia's programmed aid. It was also agreed that planning for the review would commence shortly and that a working group would start meeting by April.

         In the context of the discussions, I was happy to be able to announce an $11 million project to assist sustainable forestry in Papua New Guinea, a matter of some concern in Australia as well. The project will improve education of forestry personnel and assist Papua New Guinea in the monitoring of logging activities. In announcing that, I urged Papua New Guinea to ensure that appropriate sustainable forest policies were implemented in line with the outcomes of the South Pacific Forum meeting in Brisbane. One move in that context would be to increase the level of export taxes on logs to improve the returns of logging to Papua New Guinea.

         Finally, I was able to present Papua New Guinea ministers with a report prepared by AIDAB on the damage to public infrastructure following the volcanic eruptions in Rabaul. That information will help them make the necessary decisions on the restoration or relocation of facilities in East New Britain and I believe it will be most valuable in that context.

         I think its report was a good, solid piece of work, which flowed out of a thorough consultation process, and it was very comprehensive in its review of the issues. It has put forward some 50 recommendations that will be considered in a budget context, and we will be developing a considered response to the report next year in that context. There is one recommendation in the report that, I can indicate, the government will be accepting now, and that is that the government maintain a targeted approach to pension provision. The alternative to that, which has been espoused by some, is the so-called universal pension, which in effect means paying pensions to everybody, irrespective of any assets or income test; in other words, completely removing any means testing.

         As anybody who is remotely honest concedes, the reality is that that is simply unaffordable. We are talking about a cost of some $5 billion a year arising from removing all income and assets testing on pensions. It is also inequitable, and this has been confirmed in a study of the proposals by the retirement income modelling task force, which is a group of officials from Treasury, Finance and Social Security. Not only is it unaffordable; it is inequitable in its impact.

         Contrary to the claims of the member for Berowra, proposals in this area were properly considered by the review. Just because a proposal is rejected does not mean that it was not properly considered. The honourable member for Berowra tries to have two-bob each way. A press release put out on the day said that he has an open mind on universal pension, saying that he will `continue to examine any proposals for a universal pension'. What profound dishonesty that is! This is the party that persistently criticises us for not making enough progress in cutting the deficit yet it criticises any suggestion that taxes might rise or that a government might increase its revenue. This is the party that says it has an open mind on a proposition that would have an annual budgetary impact of $5 billion. This is the sort of dishonesty that we get.

         There has been some reference to a proposal by the Institute of Actuaries. That proposal has been looked at by the retirement income modelling task force that I made reference to earlier. The institute attempts to fund the proposal by cutting the base rate of pension by $7—is that what the honourable member for Berowra proposes?—by freezing the superannuation guarantee charge; by more rapidly increasing the pension age for women, with further increases for both men and women in future; and by changing superannuation tax concessions. RIM suggests that by 2003 around $3 billion of national savings would be lost each year as a consequence of doing that.

         The honourable member for Berowra also referred in his press release to the possibility of taxing the pension benefit which, as far as I can see, can only mean abolishing the pension rebate, the effect of which would be a cut of $11.40 per week for single pensioners. These are the sorts of things that you have to do to make a universal pension cost-effective, to use the honourable member for Berowra's terms. He knows full well that there is not the slightest chance in the world that a government of which he was a member would introduce such an arrangement. There is not the slightest possibility of that, and he knows it. He ought not to be dragging these sorts of propositions before the electorate in what I say is this thoroughly dishonest way. He knows that what he is putting forward cannot be done. It is just an absolute joke for a party that professes concern for fiscal rectitude to put forward—

It was for that reason that when the due diligence report, duly carried out by Price Waterhouse and Salomon Brothers, was presented to the cabinet, the cabinet made a very important decision, and that was to request that I approach the directors of ANL and seek their resignations with a view to the installation of a new board in an attempt to rescue the company.

It was Mr Bolitho's wish that the government under deadlock-breaking provisions which he had negotiated with the other two shareholders, Howard Smith and Jamieson Equities, Mr Corrigan's outfit, should proceed to go from 25 per cent to 100 per cent ownership. That was, as I characterised in this House, a $280 million ask because, firstly, you had to buy Howard Smith for $28 million using your pre-emptive rights, then you had to be prepared to go into the auction with Corrigan and buy him out for at least the same amount of money, and then you had to take on the whole capital expenditure program that is in their three-year business plan. And on top of all of that you had one other responsibility, which was to assume the debt of Australian Stevedores.

         The end result of that was $280 million of further taxpayer commitment to Australian Stevedores. What for?

It was not my decision; it was a decision finally taken by a subcommittee of cabinet comprising the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and me.

         It was suggested on the program last night that there was a five-day maritime strike—a strike brought about by the government's decision to sell its 25 per cent shareholding in Australian Stevedores. We either had to buy for $280 million or sell our quarter share. Let me remind the House—because these little urban myths have a habit of being perpetuated by one or other of the players in this—that the five-day maritime dispute came about as a result of the unions attempting to force the government to commit the taxpayer for the $280 million. The government, to its credit, said that it would not be forced to follow that course of action. Instead, the strike commenced at noon on the Thursday and on the Friday afternoon we disposed of our 25 per cent.

The minister would have seen media reports stating the government's intention to install Anzac Day on 25 April as Australia's national day of commemoration to recognise this country's war dead and all those who served in war. Due to the significance of next year as the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, could the minister inform the House whether the government's intention will be carried out prior to Anzac Day 1995?

Some time ago in this House the member for Melbourne Ports, Mr Holding, and the member for Cook, Mr Dobie, in a bipartisan approach brought a private members motion to this House in which they asked exactly for this. The ex-service community has for some time been concerned that, as time goes on, the importance of Anzac Day could be diminished, with younger generations coming up who may not be aware of the debts that are owed to those people who have fought not only in World War I or World War II but also in other wartime conflicts.

         Accordingly, the government tomorrow will be introducing a bill in this House to enshrine Anzac Day in legislation as the day of commemoration, and we will provide that 25 April of each year be known as Anzac Day. I want to thank all members of this House because I am certain that the legislation will be accepted—the honourable member for O'Connor publicly said that he would accept it. I am sure that it will be passed, and I have every confidence in ensuring that it will be passed in time for Anzac Day 1995, which will mark the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II.

         This year the Commonwealth provided Western Australia with more than half a million dollars under one program, the priority languages incentive element, and a quarter of a million dollars under another program, the community languages element. Both these are elements of the school language program. The Commonwealth will maintain this level of support in 1995. In addition, the Commonwealth is to provide $67.7 million over the next four years to support increased enrolments in key Asian language studies among students from years 3 to 10 around Australia. The languages concerned are Indonesian, Chinese, Japanese and Korean. The national Asian languages studies strategy for Australian schools, NALSSAS, was agreed to by the Council of Australian Governments earlier this year and, of course, that included Western Australia.

         The Commonwealth appreciates the considerable benefits of fostering a multilingual population and it recognises the provision of appropriate funding as a key part of that process. For that reason, we provide considerable funds to the Western Australian government for this purpose. If schools in Western Australia are unable to offer classes through an alleged lack of trained teachers, there is no justification—none—for claiming that the fault lies with the Commonwealth. The Western Australian government has been provided with the funds. It is the Western Australian government's responsibility to use those funds and to provide the classes.

In doing so, you raised to a new high level the acceptable form of language and the acceptable form of interpretation in relation to the standing orders. There is no going back from that. Having allowed that kind of interpretation on a standing order in this House this week, such a loose interpretation, you cannot now selectively and rigorously interpret the same standing orders in relation to standing order 144. Any ruling you now give must be consistent with the way you have interpreted standing orders this week in relation to the same set of standing orders. On that basis, such words must be allowed and must be ruled to be in order in questions.

Thank you very much, Minister, for reminding us today of those who have gone before you who have ultimately seen the light and resigned.

         The reputation that the Minister for Transport brought to this House when he was elected to the federal parliament in 1990 was one that certainly gave the impression that he, in his former role in the state parliament, was the equivalent of having an albatross around your neck. We all remember the reputation that this man had as the minister for public works in New South Wales. We will all remember the problems that the Wran-Unsworth government had in its dying days. Honourable members will remember the former Premier of New South Wales Barrie Unsworth, the old cardigan killer. Many people thought he was not all that bright. But I tell you that Barrie Unsworth was bright enough to know that, coming up to the election, the biggest albatross around the Labor government's neck in 1988 was none other than Laurie Brereton.

Whether it be in the portfolio of industrial relations, whether it be his handling of the third runway controversy and all of the surrounding noise problems in Sydney, whether it be the handling of ANL or, indeed, the handling of aviation safety, this minister has got himself into hot water—on each and every one of those issues.

         During this week, we also saw the Auditor-General's report being tabled in the Senate. What did the Auditor-General's report tell us? It told us three things. Firstly, it drew some very serious questions about the process by which the Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers report on, and valuation of, ANL was undertaken. The importance of that report on, and valuation of, ANL is that the Minister for Transport based all of his actions surrounding his decisions with ANL on that report. Yet the Auditor-General, in his report tabled in this parliament during the week, draws into question the whole process of the Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers valuation mechanism for the ANL. That is the first thing the report tells us.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Secondly, the Auditor-General in his report makes the point that he has been very concerned about certain public officials making public utterances which have the potential to damage the value of ANL. We heard earlier today the Minister for Finance trying to tell us that this was not directed in any way at the Minister for Transport. Yet the Minister for Transport got up here a little while later and said that the only thing in the Auditor-General's report he was worrying about was the gratuitous advice that had been levelled at him.

         Do you know what the Auditor-General was saying? The Auditor-General was saying that the big mouth of the Minister for Transport has cost this country tens of millions of dollars. Why? Because he gave a press conference on national television and said, `You could not give ANL away.' We are in the business of trying to sell ANL. It is a business that is worth many millions of dollars. Yet this man went out and said that we could not give it away. In the process of doing that, he damaged the value of that business irreparably. That is the second thing the Auditor-General's report tells us.

         In addition to that, the Auditor-General attached an addendum to his report—a rather unusual thing for him to do. It is a letter from the Secretary to the Department of Finance—no doubt at the instruction of the Minister for Finance—requesting that the Auditor-General alter some key paragraphs in his report which are implicitly critical of the comments of the Minister for Transport about the value of ANL. That is what this letter is all about. It was unusual for the Auditor-General to do that—but necessary because he felt that, unless he made it quite clear that an attempt had been made to try to whitewash this report, people would not note the gravity of the situation surrounding this whole process of trying to sell ANL.

In addition to that, it will cost us more. We have already heard that next year we will have to have written into the budget an extra $50 million to try to keep this business that this man has now taken full charge of afloat for another 12 months. We also see that it will cost us money because of the big mouth this man has got. The views he has expressed, which he thinks are important, such as that ANL could not be given away, have cost the taxpayers of Australia a tremendous amount of money.

         As I said, Bill Bolitho made some extraordinary claims on the television last night. Over the last few weeks, we have also had several articles written by Laura Tingle. The minister referred to them in his comments today in question time. Those articles by Laura Tingle go to the whole propriety of this government. They refer to a secret loan of $22.4 million given by the company that this minister claims is bankrupt and that you could not give away to the company that was buying ANL's shares in Australian Stevedores. Yet today we heard the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport saying, `This was not a loan; this was just a deferred payment. It was exactly the same deal that Howard Smith had with Jamison Equity when it sold its 25 per cent shareholding in Australian Stevedores.'

         Let me tell you that it was not the same deal and the minister knows that. In fact, he knows it very well. The Australian Stevedores shares that Howard Smith owned were not handed over straightaway to Jamison Equity. It did not lend Jamison Equity the money. This government with its secret deal, which Laura Tingle has highlighted to us, actually gave a $22.4 million loan to Jamison Equity, handed over all the shares and gave the seat on the board of Australian Stevedores that ANL had directly to Jamison Equity. None of this was done by Howard Smith. There is a clear and distinct difference. This government would have us believe that the deal that it did with Jamison Equity was exactly the same deal that Howard Smith did. It was not.

We are not going to get it opened because the Prime Minister was the man who directed that it be closed. The reason why it was closed was explained further on in the same article. It states:

         The political significance of Mr Keating's proposal was that the noise impact on the most marginal Labor seats of Barton (1.1 per cent) and St George (3.7 per cent) would be greatly reduced, while the areas where noise would increase would be the safest Labor seats—Sydney (20 per cent) and Grayndler (10 per cent).

        We now know why we have all these problems over Sydney with the third runway. It has nothing to do with the east-west runway operating simultaneously with the other two north-south runways being unsafe. It is all about grubby politics—politics designed to advantage nobody else but the Labor Party. The man responsible for it is the Prime Minister. But the man who is covering for him, the champion deceiver, is going around trying to convince us that we cannot have this east-west runway up and running because it would be unsafe. This is yet another example of the way in which this minister is not honestly and properly administering his portfolio responsibilities.

         Another thing that earns him the title of champion deceiver is the meeting he held with some local government officials from Marrickville Council on 28 July this year. The minister was in possession of a report which indicated that the local government officials who were meeting with him had seriously underestimated the degree of noise they would experience as a result of the opening of the third runway. This minister, according to those officials, did not tell them about that report. He kept that report secret.

         That report only saw the light of day when it was subpoenaed to be heard in the Federal Court hearings of November of this year. That is the reason that report became public. That is another clear example of the way this minister has deceived the people of Sydney over the noise levels they would experience as a result of the third runway being up and running.

         Another thing that earns this minister the title of being incompetent is that he opened the third runway months ahead of the rest of the facilities at Sydney airport being ready. You have to ask yourself: why did the minister open the third runway months before the new air traffic control tower would be open? Why did he open it 12 months in advance of the new radar system being able to be used? That is a very good question.

         The net result of that is that 91 per cent of all flights going into Sydney airport are currently delayed. Ansett experienced up to 30,000 complaints from travellers in one particular day. The capacity of Sydney airport has been reduced from 64 aircraft movements per hour to 50 craft movements per hour. We have gone out and spent over $200 million building the third runway, we have opened it, because this man decided to do it, months in advance of the rest of the facilities being available for use and the net result is the creation of an enormous mess at Sydney airport.

In the process of breaking it, this minister has destroyed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Sydneysiders over the last few weeks because he has not been prepared to deal properly with the issue of noise levels for Sydneysiders. The reason is that his Prime Minister is the man who made the decision to close the east-west runway  for grubby, political purposes. That is why those people are suffering at this time.

         A censure motion is supposed to be the most serious thing that can happen in the parliament. A censure motion is a debate in respect of charges that should go to the very integrity of the minister being challenged. What did we see in the contribution from the honourable member? Not a single significant charge, but a lot of mealy-mouthed rubbish and recycled press releases—of course, he is the king of the press releases—but nothing to sustain the charge that I should be censured by this House.

         As I have said to the House, the position of ANL was one causing us grave concern. We acted decisively and properly in order to make sure that taxpayers' interests were protected. We acted to make sure that ANL did not continue to haemorrhage to the average tune of $24 million per year—year in and year out. Indeed, the whole of the process I have instituted on behalf of the cabinet has been aimed at protecting taxpayers' interests, just as was the decision to sell the 25 per cent share in Australian Stevedores, which has been referred to by the honourable member this afternoon. It was a decision taken in order to eliminate a potential liability, which the trade union movement was trying to force us into, to spend $280 million and nationalise the greatest stevedoring company in Australia.

         I have indicated to the House before the nature of the problems facing ANL, but I recount them. The fact is that the due diligence report this year from Price Waterhouse and Salomon Brothers, in no way cut down by the Auditor-General, indicates that ANL over-estimated its profit forecasts, year in and year out. In fact, in September 1990 the advice of the board of ANL to the government was that its shipping terminals and business would earn it $32 million. They lost ANL $5.3 million. The same month, June 1991, the board was forecasting to the government that everything would be okay and that it was going to make $21.4 million in its shipping and terminal businesses. That was its projected profit for the next year. The result was a dismal loss of $26 million recorded by June of 1992—a turnaround of $47 million in 12 months.

         What was happening during this process? The board of ANL, chaired by Mr Bolitho, was indicating that everything was going to be all right, that everything was going to come up roses in the garden. In fact, it is worth recounting that Mr Bolitho, in his press release of 16 December 1993, claimed that ANL as a whole would at least break even in 1993-94. The result for 1993-94 will be somewhere between a $10 million and $20 million loss, the same sort of loss that it has sustained year in and year out.

         saying that the company could expect solid profits for the next few years. We now know, as a result of the work of Salomon Brothers and Price Waterhouse, the very dismal state of that business. It was only six months after that that the company itself was coming to us saying that it wanted to draw down its promissory note, saying that it did not have sufficient funds to pay its bills.

         The fact is that ANL has only survived so long by selling assets. This is the bottom line. Mr Bolitho went on television last night—the member for Hume has relied on him for some of his comments—and talked about profitability. My challenge is: what profitability? We have not seen profitability for years. If you take out the selling of a large part of its fleet—it has already sold most of its fleet—and you take out the sale of its future income stream, another little trick aimed at keeping the company afloat, then you find that the figures for ANL are even more appalling. These sales are not revealed in those figures of an average $24 million a year loss that I have given, but in the process ANL has flogged off most of the fleet.

         ANL has gone further than that. It has sold the cash flow in respect of some remaining elements of the fleet. If you take out those extras, you find that ANL has pranged not just for the last four years but for six of the last seven years. When I come along, in concert with the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), and say that we are bringing in outside experts and that a due diligence study will be carried out, and when that due diligence study reveals the true state and nature of ANL and the government acts decisively, you have the hide to criticise us. Even then, as I have revealed in the House today, you could not get your act together. The shadow minister for privatisation is saying one thing and the shadow minister for transport is saying another. One is saying `liquidate' in respect of ANL; the other is saying `prop up'.

         You talk about credibility. You have no credibility on this matter. The government was properly concerned about ANL in terms of the approach of the board of directors. It needs to be remembered that Mr Bolitho was there for 10 years. During that whole 10-year period, the company paid $20.7 million in dividends to the government. I repeat: in the whole of the 10 year-period, the government got $20.7 million. During that time, the government pumped $160.5 million into the company in debt forgiveness or equity injection. During that period, the taxpayer went down the gurgle hole to the tune of $140 million.

         Someone had to do something about that situation. It was not just that money that had been lost. The current debt of ANL sits in the books at $180 million. That $180 million has to be picked up at the end of the day by the taxpayer. The government acted decisively and did something about that, and you have the hide to come into this House and challenge us in this censure motion against me. We have done the right and courageous thing in regard to ANL—the sort of thing that you would never do and never did during the many years that you had the carriage and control of ANL from 1975 to 1983.

It is coming from the colleagues of John Fahey sitting opposite here.

         —Not one single federal member bothered to turn up—or maybe I should say that they were not game enough to turn up. Had the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), who has just spoken, been there he would have noted, among other things, the intention of people to lynch him. They believe—and rightly so—that, as the minister, he has to carry the responsibility for the total disruption to the lifestyle of thousands upon thousands of Sydney residents. One of them made the  point, which I thought was rather cryptic, that Mr Brereton's street should be made runway No. 4.

         More recently than that, last Saturday at Leichhardt Oval, 10,000 people came out on this issue. Yes, it is serious. Yes, it is important. Yes, it does affect the lives of these people. The one characteristic that brought those people together was not just noise and its clear physical and psychological effect upon them and their families, but the firm belief that they have been misled by this government that for so long has carried out, under the protection of silence, a series of activities which were ultimately going to cause massive losses to the character of their lifestyle, to the value of their homes—to their very sanity. When we heard those people speaking at those public meetings, we heard from the heart what ordinary people are suffering because of the circumstances over which they have absolutely no control.

         It is fine for the minister to tell us why the east-west runway cannot be reopened. It is fine for him to protect himself on the grounds that the CAA says that there are safety reasons. Of course, safety in aviation is of fundamental importance. But the sad fact of the matter is that there are political considerations in this area. The honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson), who is in the chamber here today, knows that she has been sacrificed. She knows that she is the loser of this outcome, and she knows that the government has made a decision that Barton, St George, Sydney and Grayndler are more important than the seat of Lowe. Let me assure her of one thing: we are on her side. The boundaries of this problem do not stop at the Parramatta River. This problem goes well beyond that—well over Lane Cove, well over Hunters Hill and right to the very edge of Ku-ring-gai National Park. Even the animals in the park are complaining.

         We were not told about this. My constituents were not told. People in Chatswood were not told. People up in Wahroonga and Turramurra were not told. I had an engineer do a survey this week in west Pymble, and he picked up 88 decibels of sound. It might be worth members knowing that on the race track those very noisy sports cars are not allowed to go over 100 decibels. So when you are talking about 88 decibels in a valley—that is where this person did the test—you can see easily what the effect of noise is on the people who are caught in this environment. Geography has them caught, and the sound reverberates through their homes and through their lives.

         Version 6 of the Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport noise management plan was issued in March 1994. When you go through this document, you find these interesting tables outlining the effect that the noise would have on people. It talks about the aircraft noise effect on people by the year 2010. It almost puts you into that somnolent sense that it is over the hill, far away; that it is not really going to be an issue for the people of today. But it is a problem for the people of today; it is a very real problem on a daily basis.

         The questions asked and the analysis which was carried out was very interesting. Was it going to affect conversation, watching TV or listening to radio or music? Would sleep be disturbed by noise? There is an analysis of the number of people who would be affected by the noise: 26,800 would be seriously affected; 127,700 would be moderately affected; 100,000 people would have their conversation disturbed; and 135,300 would be disturbed whilst watching TV or listening to radio. I love the preciseness of these figures. A mere 59,000 people would have their sleep disturbed. The document claims that the total number of people in that group in the population who would be affected by the airport is 417,600 people. My mathematics may not be marvellous but it seems to me that, on the basis of this survey, every single person has been affected to a significant degree by the noise generated by this airport. That survey was done on the basis of the anticipated problems in the year 2010.

         We have been told by the minister today that, in this year alone, the use of Mascot airport has gone up by over 50 per cent in those peak periods. If the increase is 50 per cent in one year, what is it going to be by the year 2010? The people of Sydney demand answers to these problems. They believe, and rightly so, that this analysis which apparently took place was either wrong or was organised in such a way that people were never told the truth. I, like many other members in this House who have been affected by this problem, have received numerous letters from constituents who make these points. They ask us to be their voice in this House. They ask us to say to the government, `You are ruining our lives. Why did you do this to us and why didn't you give us a fair warning?' Mr K. Lane of Turramurra wrote:

        The interesting thing is that this analysis done by the government never at any stage suggested that the problems of the airport were going to go beyond a clearly defined area, the northern boundary of which would be the Parramatta River. Not one of the maps provided by the authority, by the government, by the minister, by his department, shows a single indicator of any noise problems north of the Parramatta River or the Lane Cove River. Yet the fundamental fact of the matter is that those figures of the number of people affected by sound are absolutely flawed. The real figure is probably twice that. I think we have a right to know why that is so. Why were those figures so wrong? Why was that analysis so wrong? Why were people not told? Why was this whole exercise carried through with such a degree of secrecy, in an underhand way?

         This story goes back to at least 20 October 1976, when Prime Minister Fraser and Premier Wran announced a series of important studies called the MANS study. The object of that study was to examine jointly the implications of the likely growth of air traffic in the Sydney region and to recommend a suitable strategy for major airport development. It is interesting to note that by 14 December 1979 our dear friend Mr Wran and his cohorts had pulled out of the exercise because they did not want to get too close to the heat; it could be a bit embarrassing politically. Nevertheless, in a report which was presented on 14 December 1979 the Commonwealth members recommended that a decision in principle should be taken to develop Kingsford Smith airport by the construction of a close space parallel runway and associated facilities east of the existing north-south runway and that land be reserved in the Sydney region for a second curfew-free major airport.

         The honourable member has just said that that would have been disastrous. Let us think this through more carefully. On 7 October 1982 the then Minister for Aviation, Mr Fife, announced the construction of a new runway at KSA. He stressed that `this new runway is not an alternative to a new airport, but a necessary first step if Sydney is to remain as Australia's main aviation gateway'. He added:

         —The point Mr Fife was making was that a close space runway—not a broad space runway which you finally got—was going to take aircraft above Botany Bay. Instead of that, the runway you constructed has taken aircraft across the city of Sydney, affecting hundreds of thousands if not millions of people who previously had not had a problem with aircraft—or, if it was a problem, it was certainly a manageable one. They are the realities of the situation. Ever since 1983, since the then shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), announced in the election campaign that the Labor government would abandon the plan to build a second runway, there has been nothing but trouble and politics in this whole thing. This whole issue has been fraught with politics. Now the people in these Labor electorates—and in Liberal electorates in places like the north shore of Sydney—are carrying a substantial cost—

         This is pretty cool. You have the opposition deciding that this is such a serious issue that it will not even put up its second eleven; it has brought out its district cricket team. If ever there was evidence that a district team had been brought out on this one it was the statements we have just heard. I do not know if Wal Fife actually did put out that press release. I would like to believe that Wal Fife did not. I would like to believe that Wal Fife has been misquoted. If he seriously put up an argument, as you just did, that you have a north-south runway and that it will simply operate away from the suburb affected by north-south runways all the time, irrespective of the wind direction, then I suspect that if anybody has been a misleader, a liar or a prevaricator in any way, shape or form in this exercise it has been Wal. I find it impossible to believe that of Wal. I think that Wal was a very decent person. The opposition must be making that up. I am sure that Wal would not ever have said anything as silly as that, given the knowledge that he would have of aviation matters.

         One of the things that Wal was not able to do at the time was to identify a second airport site in Sydney. That was a privilege which fell to me when I happened to be minister for aviation and we identified the Badgerys Creek site after years of both sides of politics being completely incapable of arriving at a conclusion as to where Sydney's very necessary second airport ought to be. But I can tell you one other thing about the close space parallel runway: it would have made no difference in any of these noise profiles at all. If you sit down there and think your way through logically these propositions, you can see how absurd that proposition is unless you are going to play God and totally change the wind system of Sydney. The one great problem about that close space parallel runway was that it was so close that, unfortunately, you got into the position where you could not increase the usage of the runway at least to the levels of the cross runway carriage. It was a hopeless position to arrive at; nevertheless the opposition of the day managed to arrive at it. What you had out of the solution that the government ultimately arrived at was a workable one.

         There is a better possibility of doing that sort of thing, if that is the road they choose to take. I think that is taking a bit of punt, but it is not impossible. What would be the effect of that? Remember who you are dealing with here. You are dealing with the people who are affected in the northern corridors of the city of Sydney, identified correctly in the EIS, of which you are already aware. The one effect of doing that would be to offer them no relief but to increase heavy jet movements on the two runways.

         —by leave—The world has changed dramatically since the Australian government published its last defence white paper in 1987. We knew then that we were living in a dynamic era, but the nature and the pace of the changes which have since taken place were quite unforeseeable. Of all the changes, the most significant has been the collapse of the Soviet Union. This was a massively important event, which fundamentally changed the global security environment.

         Almost overnight, the east-west stand-off, which dominated international strategic affairs for 50 years, was no more. No part of the globe was unaffected by this radical change—certainly not Asia and the Pacific. This historic geo-strategic change has been accompanied in the Asia-Pacific region by continued and rapid economic growth. Potentially, this too has enormous long-term consequences for strategic relationships and security in the region.

         The government's 1994 defence white paper, Defending Australia, addresses the long-term consequences of these major changes for our defence policy. Defending Australia looks ahead 15 years to provide broad guidance for defence policy making and for the force structure and capability decisions we will have to make. It provides the framework for developing our defence policy through the next decade. Defending Australia is a substantial and complex document. Today I will simply  highlight some of the underlying thinking and key themes.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Our starting point is the conviction that Australia must maintain the capability to defend itself against armed attack. Despite all the hopes and aspirations we share for reducing the chances of conflict since the end of the Cold War, military force is still an important element in international affairs, and will remain so. That is a fact of life, regrettably—but a fact nevertheless.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is also a fact that, while we will do all we can to avoid the use of force ourselves, ultimately, armed force can only be resisted by armed force. We must, therefore, continue to be sure that we can defeat an armed attack on our territory. We have a continent of our own to defend, and a unique set of national interests. We must be self-reliant, with the capabilities to provide for our defence without relying on the combat forces of other countries.

         The key judgment in this white paper is that fundamental changes in strategic affairs, both globally and within our region, will make Australia's strategic environment more demanding over the next 15 years. The threat of global war has all but disappeared, but so has the predictable shape which the Cold War imposed on strategic affairs throughout Asia and the Pacific. In its place, a new, more fluid and more complex strategic pattern will emerge.

         Security in the region will be shaped by continued high levels of economic growth. The sustained expansion in the economies of most countries is bringing enormous social and economic benefits. It is also increasing the capacity of many countries to modernise and develop their armed forces, and to become more confident and self-reliant in their security. The military capabilities of our regional neighbours are improving, especially through the introduction of higher technology systems. We will also see a growing capacity to sustain and operate these systems.

         Australia looks to the future of this region with confidence, and with a strong awareness of the opportunities which Asia offers for our own future. In looking to our long-term security, we will take a positive approach to the region, and to the international defence policies and relationships which support our defence interests. Nevertheless, prudence requires that we maintain the capabilities to ensure our defence self-reliance.

         Australia's defence policy, as spelt out in this white paper, recognises our responsibility to help shape our security environment. This requires that we engage closely with our region on strategic issues; that we maintain our alliances with the United States and New Zealand; and that we contribute effectively to multinational security efforts.

         At the same time, our alliance with the United States will continue to be a key element of our defence policy.

         While the government will continue its active pursuit of Australia's international defence interests in these ways, the key message of Defending Australia is that our highest defence priority will continue to be to build, maintain and support forces which ensure we can defeat any armed attack against Australia. We do not believe that any country has an intention to use force against Australia. We have no disputes with other countries which might be expected to give rise to the use of force, and there is also no reason to expect one to develop.

         However, disputes can arise and intentions can change relatively quickly. Because military capabilities take many years to develop, it follows that we plan on the basis of capabilities and not threats. Let me repeat that: we plan on the basis of capabilities, not threats.

         No country has the capability to seize and hold major territory on our continent. Significantly, we believe that no country plans to develop such forces. To do so would require a very large effort, and we would expect to have substantial warning of any such development. However, the capabilities available to mount lesser levels of attack on Australia will grow over the next 15 years. Such attacks could be very damaging to Australia, and could arise with relatively little warning. The key challenge for defence capability planning will be to adapt to the greater demands posed by increasing military capabilities in such short-warning conflict.

         We will continue to use the most cost-effective means to ensure our security.

This means giving clear priority to the naval and air capabilities needed to deny our approaches to an adversary.

         We must recognise, however, that the development of military technology poses new challenges. Over the longer term, we will need to be more selective about those military capabilities in which we must maintain our technological advantage. We will also use our defence capabilities more efficiently. All elements of the Australian Defence Force will work closely together as an integrated force and make the best possible use of their equipment and facilities. Our ability to draw on wider national resources will grow in importance.

         From this key objective flow the main defence priorities set out in Defending Australia. I want to highlight three today.

         The end of the Cold War has brought with it new but sometimes uneasy balances. It has seen the coincident breakdown of order in the Balkans and in central Asia, just to mention two. There have been some increasing tensions over proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in north Asia, for example, which is in our own region. Also, in our own region, the spectacular economic success of some of Australia's neighbours has underpinned a steady improvement in regional defence capabilities and signals an inevitable end to our claims to continued technological superiority in defence capabilities.

         At the same time, there have been stresses and fractures in long established alliances and there have been renewed pressures on the will and the resources of multinational fora, such as the United Nations. These and other developments have raised new uncertainties and new challenges for defence policy makers. Australia is not immune from direct developments in our own region or from the flow-on effects from events further afield. I quote with approval paragraph 1.6 of the white paper, which I think puts it quite well:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The next fifteen years will see great change in our strategic environment. With the end of the Cold War, important new uncertainties have emerged about the future strategic situation in Asia. Economic growth will increase the power of nations in our region, and political change may make their policies less predictable. Because of these uncertainties, we acknowledge the possibility that our security environment could deteriorate, perhaps quite seriously in the future. We recognise that at some time in the future armed force could be used against us and that we need to be prepared to meet it.

        That is a useful summary contained in the early pages of this defence white paper. This is not to say—I do not say—or suggest that Australia suddenly finds itself in a new and threatening environment. But it does mean that the certainties of the Cold War are over and that Australia will have to work hard to promote and secure its own interests in a more fluid and potentially more volatile region. In that context, the coalition does welcome the government's interest in defence and the release of this paper.

         It is sometimes stated by defence commentators in Australia that, leaving the Democrats and the Greens aside—you can safely discard them when it comes to sensible debate on these issues—there is a fair degree of common ground between the major parties on defence issues and that differences centre more on the scope and scale of defence preparedness and on issues of portfolio management than on the broad thrust of defence policy.

There have been delays in the Collins project, mismanagement and debates about the Anzac contract and we have had the ill-conceived ready reserve scheme which I think the government, in its heart of hearts, knows was ill-conceived from the word go.

         At $9.87 billion in 1994-95, defence allocations will fall to 2.1 per cent of GDP.

         I will put it in the most simple terms: when the government brought down its defence paper in 1987 it said, `This is what we think we ought to do to defend Australia. This is the personnel and equipment that is necessary.' To achieve that the government would need to spend between 2.6 and three per cent of GDP. That was the way it was going to proceed. It did proceed and proceeded particularly on the capital equipment side. The opposition has supported the government in its commitments to buy new ships, submarines and other sorts of equipment. But the fact is that after it made the commitments it then started to cut back on defence spending. It was committed to various contracts and the like on the equipment side so, when it was short of a dollar, what did it do? It cut into readiness and personnel resources.

         I have said in earlier speeches that it would be tragic for Australia's defence if the white paper simply sets about justifying existing structures and capabilities. It is the old trap of situating the appreciation rather than providing a disciplined analysis upon which defence policy and force structure planning can be solidly founded. Unfortunately, this has proved to be true. This white paper simply recycles the 1987 white paper, the 1991 force structure review and the 1993 strategic review. It offers very little that is new to the debate. It is less a policy review than an apology for the government's failure to fund its last white paper proposals.

         I conclude my response, which is a bit limited by nature of the schedule today, with three issues. The first goes to Labor's approach to regional defence cooperation. This government, which prides itself on its understanding of Asia, has not managed to strike the right balance in its proposals for closer regional defence cooperation. The 1994 defence white paper fails to recognise that the development of a sense of strategic community, which is so vital to continued regional stability, rests on a balanced effort to strengthen regional relationships as well as on direct bilateral ties.

         In our defence policy document A Strong Australia, released in 1992, the coalition unambiguously supported the strengthening of defence ties in the region under the aegis of cooperative regional defence. Our policy places particular emphasis on the development of defence cooperative arrangements, particularly where these serve to improve stability through transparency and mutual understanding. We were heartened to see that this concept was picked up by the government in the 1993 Strategic Review and were pleased to see its similar acknowledgment in this latest white paper.

         The extension of Labor's strategic horizons beyond South-East Asia to North Asia, to include Japan, the Koreas, China and Taiwan, and the Indian subcontinent is also welcome. But, on Labor's record, we doubt whether it will be able to translate its expressions of good intention into effective action. Labor has too often displayed an inconsistency in its dealings with the region and this has, at times, caused some friction. Our relations with Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand have all been bedevilled by Labor's lack of balance and even-handedness. Sadly, I do not see any relief from this in the latest white paper.

         Indonesia, for example, is now touted by the defence minister as our most important relationship. I hope that this does not send confusing signals to our longstanding defence partners in the region—particularly New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Singapore and Malaysia—who are partners in formal defence arrangements.

         Indonesia is important, but other regional players deserve appropriate regard. Relative size and proximity should not be the only determinants of the importance of bilateral relations. The coalition acknowledges the significant role which smaller and less proximate nations also play in promoting regional stability. It views the scope of relationships between regional nations to be no less important than the strength of discrete bilateral relations.

         While the government is right to focus on the development of bilateral relationships, it must not lose sight of the need to promote regional, and not just bilateral, cooperation. And it should not overlook the fact that our bilateral cooperative programs also offer opportunities for promoting interaction between regional counterparts. In particular, concurrent attendance by officers from regional nations at courses at our military and academic institutions offers far greater scope for effective and cooperative interaction than a purely bilateral course.

         Similarly, we should seek to promote seminars and discussions at the senior policy and strategic levels on a broader than bilateral basis.

By mutually beneficial, I mean regional and not just bilateral benefit.

         The second matter I raise is a rather specific one, but it is on my mind because I have been reading the papers this morning about the Prime Minister and his interest in foreign affairs matters. It reminds me that the skills you learn as a wheeler and dealer in the New South Wales Right are not always appropriately transferred and applied in the matter of sensitive international relations. I refer particularly to two paragraphs in the defence white paper. The first is paragraph 2.17, which refers to Taiwan. It states in part:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The relationship between China and Taiwan is likely to evolve in response to political change in both, but in a direction that is not easy to foretell.

        I also quote an interesting statement from paragraph 8.29. It states:

        In time, opportunities also may arise for constructive contact with Taiwan on defence and security issues.

        My attention was drawn to this, not just because of the newspaper reports this morning but also because of the fact that in the last two or three months I have been in both China and Taiwan and there are some very interesting issues which Australian policymakers should be addressing.

         There has been a continuation of the political liberalisation in Taiwan. When I was there, I was able to see for myself the vibrant democracy at work as elections were being held for the mayoral positions in both Taipei and Kaohsiung in the south, and there was also an election for the position of Governor of Taiwan Province. It is interesting that, in the outcome, the DPP was successful in wresting the mayoral position in Taipei from the ruling party. The interest in that is that this is yet another signal of the development of a multi-party political system in Taiwan.

         Taiwan has an interesting history. When I was there, the KMT was enjoying its 100th anniversary. The KMT has had a chequered past—I think that is a fair comment to make—but it is very interesting to see in Taiwan the unilateral handing over of political power by a monopolist political party to establish a multi-party, democratic system. It is a matter of great tribute to the leaders of the society in Taiwan that those who have held power have been prepared to share power and to establish a democratic system.

         The second development there is the economic development, which is also picked up in various reflections in the defence white paper. You have to hand it to Taiwan. The fact is that 35 years ago it was an aid recipient with per capita incomes of $200 or $300. Now it has a per capita income of $7,000, and it is still growing at a very considerable rate. You come back from a place like Taiwan and you say, `It's great to be home.' But the second reaction is: `What a comparison.' Taiwan has foreign reserves of $US90 billion compared with our foreign debt of $160 billion. It has high rates of growth, and it is not talking about jacking up taxes because of the current account constraint—the same old boom-bust recession problem that we have in Australia.

         The third point I make is that I am very pleased that the government has picked up many of the proposals made by the coalition to improve the relationship between Australia and Taiwan.

         Lastly, I commend the work of Colin Heseltine and those others who provided me with assistance when I was in Taipei. I conclude by quoting paragraph 2.8 of the defence white paper. In part it states:

        The successful initiation of APEC and the ASEAN Regional Forum shows that the region can agree on broad goals. These developments give grounds for optimism.

       <para>
        That is the rhetoric of the government. I think the sad thing about the defence white paper is that, having painted a not unrealistic scenario for the future, the government has not backed that up with the resources necessary for the ADF to ensure that we can meet the situation which the government believes we will face.

        Ratification of ILO conventions has advanced the rights of workers throughout the world across a very broad spectrum. The fundamental conventions on freedom of association, forced labour and quality of opportunity, have now been ratified by well over 100 countries. Together they constitute a vital safety net of industrial protection. The fact that ratified ILO conventions are binding has also helped in countries where there has been a chance of their slipping backwards and adopting regressive legislation. However ILO conventions are by no means rigid, inflexible or overly prescriptive documents. The ILO assesses the need to revise its conventions on an ongoing basis. This ensures that they remain compatible with the realities of modern labour markets. Through its conferences, meetings and technical cooperation activities, the ILO is constantly exposed to the reality of the changing labour market conditions in each and every one of its 171 member states.

It is uniquely well placed for this, given the universality of its membership, its tripartite structure, its machinery for development and supervising standards, its principles, its values and its 75 years of operational experience. International organisations are strong and effective only if they are supported by their constituents. In Australia, the political parties and the social partners have firmly supported the ILO's principles and its work throughout its 75-year history.

        The International Labour Organisation was founded in 1919 under the Treaty of Versailles. After World War I, representatives of countries present at the peace conference framed a Constitution and an Enumeration of Principles for the International Labour Organisation. These texts would become Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles. The organisation was formed to improve labour and social conditions. For example, the preamble states:

       The 42 members of the League of Nations, including Australia, were the founding members of the ILO. Germany was admitted to the organisation in 1926 and the United States in 1934. It could well be said that the operations of the ILO—certainly through the early years—were dominated by European nations and by the developing culture in Europe of a social partnership between labour and capital. The idea emerged and then became the foundation of bureaucratic institutions—including the ILO—in such countries as Austria and Germany, where social compacts led to very heavily bureaucratised industrial relations systems. In such cases legislation is often not needed because all work practices are frequently sorted out before such issues ever even reach government. They are sorted out through total bureaucratic mechanisms.

        It has been said recently that highly centralised industrial relations systems, such as those throughout much of Europe, are reasonably efficient. It is also said that highly deregulated industrial relations systems, such as the one found in the United States, are relatively efficient. But Australia, caught in this time warp in the middle of deciding whether or not we will be highly regulated and centralised or whether we will be deregulated and open, is caught in a problem with makes us less efficient than either one of the others.

        While we have always supported the ILO and continue to do so, it causes some difficulty. One difficulty we have is the way this Labor government selectively uses ILO conventions through the external affairs power of the constitution to back legislation which otherwise would offend the constitutional powers of the various states. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) in his speech to the House a few moments ago talked about sovereignty. He talked about maintaining the sovereignty of Australia through the links of our international treaties. What the minister forgets is that we are giving away a portion of our sovereignty, we have reduced our sovereignty, by allowing international bureaucratic organisations to an extent to make laws which under other circumstances we might not have made.

        Two examples come to mind of where this government has used conventions, I believe quite improperly, to override the powers of the states. The first recent example was when the Minister for Industrial Relations used ILO convention 137, signed and ratified in 1974, 20 years ago, a convention that we have had no need to use for some considerable time because it dealt with the issue of containerisation in the ports. The minister attempted to use that convention to allow the waterfront union movement through the finance committee to reintroduce employer levies and pooling of employees to create once again a register which the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority had attempted to do away with.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The second instance is the Industrial Relations Reform Act, which came into being on 30 March this year as an amendment to the Industrial Relations Act. The minister spoke of that briefly, talking about using the ILO convention to give every Australian worker minimum rights of protection guaranteed. But he has used the ILO convention to override what are state rights. They are written into the constitution as the rights of the states to make laws with respect to industrial matters except where a dispute occurs crossing the borders of two states, in which case the Commonwealth has jurisdiction. So the minister has improperly, in my view, used ILO conventions to legislate to enable his legislation to override state legislation because there was no other way under the constitution that he could do it.

      <para first-indent="16">

        One area of concern where we differ with the ILO is the issue of freedom of association. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 20(2) states:
       </tab>

      <para font-size="-=2">
       No one shall be compelled to belong to an associa tion.
      </para>

       I believe very strongly in freedom of association. People in our country—hopefully everyone in the world—should have the right to belong or not to belong to any organisation that they choose: a union, a management organisation, a community organisation, any kind of organisation. One of our basic rights should be freedom of association. Article 22 of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights states:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Every person has the right to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of that person's interests.
      </para>
      <para>
       But ILO convention No. 87, article 2, says simply:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned, to join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Convention No. 98, article 1, in part says:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment.
      </para>
      <para>
       I agree with the sentiments expressed in those articles absolutely. But the ILO does not go on in any of its articles, in any of its conventions, to define the right that a worker or an individual shall also have, an equal right, not to belong to a union of trades—`shall have the right not to belong'. That is a very important difference in principle which we on this side of the House hold dear and which those on the other side of the House, with a Labor government that is indebted to the trade union movement and to the trade union organisations, will not endorse in any way.

        The minister talks about the tripartite nature of the ILO. I wish to bring to the attention of the House that in Australia, as in the majority of industrialised nations in the Western world, the rate of union membership is once again falling. A recent article defined, and the Australian Bureau of Statistics has confirmed, that in August 1993 union membership was down to 37.6 per cent of the work force compared with 39.6 per cent in August 1992. The unionisation rate at that time in the private sector was 27.5 per cent compared with 29.4 per cent in August 1992. The rate of decline in the public sector was higher, with the proportion of public sector employees who were union members down from 67.1 per cent in 1992 to 64.4 per cent last year.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        So all categories of union membership are showing falls. That is because of two factors. One is that unions are finding that they are less and less relevant to the needs of employees in workplaces, who today feel much more inclined to negotiate their industrial issues, their pay structures and their working conditions directly with their employer. So the two of them can work together to achieve a highly productive and high quality outcome for their firm.

The ACTU executive meeting in Melbourne this week was told that union membership affiliated with the ACTU had fallen over the last year by 400,000 to 2.4 million. Mr Sams evidently told guests at a breakfast meeting in Sydney this morning that the correct number was more likely to be closer to two million. That is a fall of 800,000 in a very short period. Mr Sams said it was vital that a new membership drive succeed. He stated:

       `If we can't do it now in 1995 with an improving economy and good employment growth then we are never going to do it and we will end up as a rump, as an unrepresentative group of people that meet from time to time and create a bit of ruckus', Mr Sams said. `But we won't actually have a major representation or a major representative organisation in which we can lobby government for the things we believe in. I think unless we address that issue and address it wholeheartedly in 1995, then we will be in for a very long period in which our influence will be marginalised.

       The tripartite nature of the ILO, about which the minister spoke so eloquently, is in danger in Australia from the union movement destroying itself because of its lack of relevance to a modern work force dedicated to improving productivity, improving wage rates and improving the lives of those who work for Australia's industry.

          That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Construction of a new building complex for the Australian Geological Survey Organisation at Symonston, ACT.
         </tab>

        <para>
         The Australian Geological Survey Organisation, AGSO, currently occupies a number of buildings, the largest of which is the Anzac Park East offices on Constitution Avenue, where it has been since 1965. Most, if not all, accommodation is unsuited to the functional and operational requirements of AGSO and a new special purpose designed and built complex will provide for the consolidation of AGSO's functions. The need to vacate Anzac Park East is a result of advice from regulatory authorities that AGSO laboratory operations should not continue in the building because existing facilities contravene fire regulations, do not comply with laboratory construction codes and contain serious OH&amp;S deficiencies.

          The project involves construction of a three-storey building comprising laboratories and related areas, offices and administrative support areas, storage areas, staff amenities, engineering workshops, roads, car parking, civil works and landscaping. The proposed building is to be located on a green field site of approximately 20 hectares in Jerrabomberra Avenue, Symonston, ACT, adjacent to the Therapeutic Goods Administration complex in Narrabundah Lane. It is anticipated that construction will commence in early 1996 with completion in 1998. The limit of cost for the project is $114 million at December 1994 prices. I table supporting drawings and commend the motion to the House.

          That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Construction of a multi-level car park for the Federal Airports Corporation at Melbourne Airport.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para>
         Melbourne airport is the second busiest in Australia. It is subject to continuing growth in passenger movements and, as a consequence, the present short-term car park is suffering severe congestion and frequent closure. As this growth in passenger numbers is forecast to continue for the foreseeable future, it is necessary for the corporation, in order to provide an appropriate level of service to its customers, to increase the capacity of the short-term car park. As it is desirable that short-term car parking spaces be provided as close as possible to the terminal, it is preferable that the increased capacity be provided in a multi-level structure adjacent to the passenger terminal, rather than through further ground level parking.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The proposed work involves the construction of a four-level, open-sided concrete car park, consisting of a covered ground level of 20,869 square metres, three suspended decks, including the open roof level, totalling 58,665 square metres, and a ground floor open car park of 23,500 square metres. It also includes: associated facilities, such as office facilities for car rental companies and police; accommodation for some high vehicles, including small buses; lifts and stairs; pedestrian bridges; goods loading dock; and landscaping and plantings. The project is planned to be completed in two stages. The first stage is expected to be in operation within eight months of the commencement of construction with the second stage following about 15 months later. I table the attached drawings. I suggest that if the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) is interested, this being a Federal Airports Corporation project, the appropriation is probably within that portfolio. I commend the motion to the House.

         This project is being conducted by my department. The Maralinga and Emu sites are located in South Australia in the region north of the Nullarbor Plain. Maralinga is 270 kilometres north-west of Ceduna. Emu is 190 kilometres north-east of Maralinga. Between 1953 and 1963, Great Britain conducted several programs of nuclear warhead development trials at Maralinga and Emu. These included detonations of nine nuclear weapons and hundreds of so-called `minor trials' that dispersed radioactive materials. The former test site areas are contaminated to various levels with plutonium and other artificially produced radioisotopes that present an unacceptable risk to future users of the sites.

          In 1969 Britain undertook a program of clean-up works called Operation Brumby. The 1985 royal commission into British nuclear tests in Australia concluded that Operation Brumby was inadequate, based on wrong assumptions and left the area in a more difficult state for any further clean-up. The royal commission concluded, inter alia, that action should begin immediately to effect a clean-up of Maralinga and Emu to a level where they are suitable for unrestricted habitation by the traditional Aboriginal owners.

          During 1990, the Commonwealth government agreed on a preferred rehabilitation option for the Maralinga test sites as a basis on which to seek a substantial contribution to rehabilitation works from the British government. This clean-up option is the lowest cost option developed by TAG that would enable Aborigines to resume access to the former test site areas. It is intended that upon completion of the project the test site area will be returned to South Australian control for addition to the Maralinga Tjarutja freehold lands.

          In December 1993, the Australian and British governments concluded an agreement under which Britain will pay #20 million in an ex gratia settlement of Australia's claims concerning the British nuclear test program in Australia. This amount will be paid in six annual instalments. The first instalment of #5 million was paid in December 1993. The proposed clean-up will reduce the radiological hazards at the test sites to enable Aboriginal use of and transit through the test site area, reduce and possibly eliminate the need for control and surveillance of the sites and remove potential Commonwealth liabilities arising from site contamination.

In its report, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works endorsed the need for the upgrade and noted that the present working and living conditions are below standard and that some facilities do not meet building codes or occupational health and safety requirements.

          The proposal, which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on 29 June 1994, is for the replacement or upgrading of a range of components including the compressor system, compressor drive and tunnel test section, and the installation of a new cooling system, a new plenum evacuation system and a new model support system. It is anticipated that construction will commence in May 1995 for completion by February 1997. The Public Works Committee tabled its report on 8 November 1994 recommending that the work proceed at a limit of cost estimate of $12.7 million at December 1993 prices.

The fact is that the suburbs of Raby and St Andrews in my electorate are as close to Badgerys Creek and its flight paths as Regents Park is to Mascot. Further, no urban area in western or south-western Sydney is within seven kilometres of the 20 ANEF contour, below which there should be no noise difficulty.

         There will be no problem at Badgerys Creek, despite the scaremongering of Mrs Cohen and the newly-endorsed Liberal candidate for Macarthur, Charlie Lynn, unless a government decides to build homes next to the airport site. Who was it two years ago in a very consistent campaign that wanted to build 100,000 residential lots through the South Creek Valley sector surrounding the Badgerys Creek airport site? It was Mrs Cohen and the Greiner and Fahey governments. They had on the planning map of New South Wales a 100,000-lot release surrounding the airport site. Now, spurred on by the impending New South Wales election, they have discovered noise as an issue, having advocated 100,000 homes around that airport site.

         The master plan and concept for Badgerys Creek has always involved a successful, competitive and well-designed airport serviced by the transport links to and from the airport site and surrounded, most importantly, by industrial land, commercial land, tourist activities and airport related economic use; that is, to have an airport that is efficient, state-of-the-art with a best practice design surrounded by economic land uses. For that reason, the state government should be supporting the accelerated development of Badgerys Creek. It should be supporting—not holding up—the planning of the road and rail access to and from the airport site.

         Shamefully, in the middle of 1992, Mrs Cohen had the planning minister, Robert Webster, come out to her electorate and abandon all the planning for the rail link between Glenfield and the Badgerys Creek airport site. That decision, shamefully, has set back the planning for Badgerys Creek by two or three years. As a result, anyone who has a legitimate concern about noise in the inner city will not find the necessary relief because of the New South Wales government.

         Further, in September 1992, the state government agreed to meet infrastructure costs of $1.3 billion associated with the development of the third runway at Mascot. When asked by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) for its commitment to the essential road and rail access to and from the Badgerys Creek airport site, the Fahey government said that it would not be spending a cent. It exposed its priorities of a third runway, no curfew in east Sydney and expenditure of $1.3 billion. The first instalment has gone down—$500 million for a Sydney to Mascot rail link. That was its priority for east Sydney.

         The building of freeways is actually funded and receives tax relief under the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill 1994. The bill states that eligible infrastructure facilities at present are road transport facilities in Australia that are used for transport of the public or their goods at a charge to them. That is federal Labor policy. Did the opposition ever think that it might score a point by standing up and saying that the federal Labor Party actually agrees with tollways?

The fundamental principle of one vote one value is reflected in the Commonwealth Electoral Act and our electoral system. That reflects the tenet of people being equal and their votes being equal. Unfortunately, this is not reflected by the parliament, the electoral act or the electoral system in my own state of Western Australia. Members should be aware that no legislation has ever been enacted in Western Australia without the support of the state colleagues of those opposite. The conservatives have always dominated the Legislative Council in Western Australia, so the electoral system in Western Australia is determined by them.

         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Gazette
         </emphasis>
         of Monday, 28 November. The electoral system required by the conservative controlled Legislative Council of Western Australia has the effect of dividing the state into a metropolitan area and a country area. It is interesting to note that of the 1,034,000 enrolled voters at the time the redistribution was effected, over 760,000 of those were in the metropolitan area and over 270,000 were in the country area. There are 34 Legislative Assembly seats allocated in the metropolitan area, so that is 34 for 760,000—an average enrolment of 22,370—and 23 seats in the country area for just over 270,000—an average enrolment of 11,887. Members can see that the vote weighting is two to one.

       <para first-indent="16">

         When you look at the electoral statistics released by the Electoral Commission at the time of the redistribution and then look at the current boundaries on the same electoral system determined by the conservative controlled Legislative Council, you find that the greatest number of enrolled voters in the metropolitan area is in the seat of Wanneroo, which is in the electorate held by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). The current enrolment in that seat is 30,885. The country seat with the lowest number of enrolled voters is Ashburton. That seat has 8,610 voters. So we have nearly a four to one weighting there.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         On the new boundaries, the greatest number of enrolled voters in the metropolitan area are in the seat of Belmont. Those 23,511 voters can be compared with the 10,363 voters in the seat of Pilbara. That is before the quotient variant of 15 per cent comes into play. So we can see what those opposite and their state colleagues stand for when it comes to treating people equally.

He described the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), as an appeaser. These are fighting words. They are deliberately designed to wound, mock and ridicule the Leader of the Opposition.

         It is pretty clear that the Queensland Nationals are hell-bent on smashing the coalition at both the federal and state levels. The first shot in this war, in this new Joh campaign, was fired on 15 November when Don McDonald, the President of the Queensland National Party, issued an ultimatum to the Queensland Liberal Party to agree to a joint Senate ticket in that state or face the repercussions. The repercussions of failure to agree to a joint Senate ticket would be three-cornered contests—three-cornered contests in seats like Fisher, Longman and Groom. That ultimatum, which was delivered by the Queensland Nationals to the Liberals, has passed. Today we have what I think is the second shot in that campaign. Today's

        A lot of Liberals have been very appreciative of the stand I've taken. Downer is trying to appease small-`l' people in the Liberal Party, but that has antagonised and disillusioned people in the coalition . . . You have got to be a mug to go along with the Labor Party—

         The point about these attacks by the member for Kennedy is that they all occurred before. They all occurred in 1987 when the Nationals humiliated their leader at the time, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), and pushed him out of the coalition. When is the member for Kennedy going to do that with the current Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer)? When is the push going to come from inside the National Party caucus to really put the pressure on the Leader of the National Party? It is crunch time for the Leader of the National Party as much as it is crunch time for the Leader of the Opposition.

         I know what the answer would be to these questions if we asked the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) or the member for Groom (Mr Taylor). They would say, `Take them on. We can't take any more of these divisive tactics from the National Party. We don't want a repeat of the Joh for PM campaign of 1987. We will stand up to the Nationals.' Because who will be the candidate for the National Party in the federal seat of Fisher at the next election? It will be none other than the son of Joh Bjelke-Petersen—John Bjelke-Petersen. The lad is looking for something useful to do. He needs a job, so he is now intending to make his bid on the back of this new campaign from the Queensland Nationals to split the coalition. The Bjelke-Petersen forces strike back.

         In 1987 we had the jack-in-the-box, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who dreamed of being PM, and the Queensland Nationals took it all away from him. Where is the honourable member for Bennelong tonight? Is he up there with the Leader of the Opposition, talking about these divisive tactics from the National Party? Is he out there condemning the National Party? Can we expect him to say something to the press about the Liberal Party and the National Party at another one of those famous doorstops where he does not really talk about anything, does not talk about a leadership challenge? Is he going to come in, stand shoulder to shoulder with the Leader of the Opposition, and repudiate the tactics from the Queensland National Party? If he is not, we all know what he is really up to: that is, he will make his bid in the new year. If we expect him to do that, I would think pigs might fly.

         The farmers of Australia got $164 million off the federal government. Very regretfully, I think a lot of the farming organisations which laid on their backs and had their tummies scratched by the federal government were lavish in their praise for the $164 million they received. A couple of weeks later, the arts in Australia got $252 million and the ANL employees effectively got around $250 million, but the $164 million was not given to the farmers; it was given to the banks. Effectively, that money goes as a subsidy on the farmers' interest, and that means that the money goes to the banks and not to the farmers. If the banks were borrowing money at five per cent and lending it out at six per cent, I would say, `Fair enough.' But, at the present moment, the banks are borrowing at five per cent and lending it to the farmers at 10 per cent, and the difference is being made up by the Australian taxpayers. Not only is this unfair but also it is toweringly stupid.

         Not only was the $164 million supposed to be good for us—the farmers in this case—but straight afterwards we had a 1 3/4 per cent rise in interest rates foisted upon us by the federal government. That led to a $302 million a year extra burden upon the farmers of Australia who owe $17,000 million. At the start of the ALP decade, they owed only some $4,700 million. That tripped off a rise in the Australian dollar which saw farmers lose $540 million per year. So, whilst we got $164 million, we now find ourselves in a situation where we have been hit with a bill from the actions of the federal government of an extra $842 million per year. Thank you; it is a lovely Christmas present from the federal government. It indicates clearly the government's treatment of the farming sector of Australia.

         Allegations of corruption within an Australian police service constitute a serious threat to the integrity of the criminal justice system and the safety of the community, not just in the particular jurisdiction but nationally. All jurisdictions have increased their cooperation in national law enforcement initiatives in response to the national and international threat of organised crime. The corruption of one police agency therefore has the potential to compromise the national law enforcement effort and to jeopardise international law enforcement cooperation.

         Such assistance as can be provided without the need for amendment of legislation is, of course, already being provided. Part of such assistance should be the provision of any evidence the Commonwealth might have of, or in relation to, such corruption. In some cases, the Commonwealth can provide relevant information without legislative change being necessary. There are, however, two important instances where specific legislative authority is necessary before information can be communicated to the royal commission. These are in relation to information obtained under the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 and the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. In relation to the latter, in some circumstances it may prevent New South Wales law enforcement agencies, as well as the Commonwealth, from providing relevant information to the royal commission.

         The matters being inquired into by the royal commission include allegations of corrupt activity by police. By their very nature, such allegations of corrupt activity may include secret transactions involving cash payments and other financial benefits. The amendments to the Financial Transaction Reports Act allow the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service to be treated as a law enforcement agency under the act. This will allow the director of AUSTRAC, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, to pass financial transaction reports information to the royal commission.

Information relevant to matters other than those the specific subject of a warrant under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act is obtained by law enforcement agencies. That act has strict rules about to whom such information may be communicated. As the act presently stands, no intercepting agency—including the New South Wales Crime Commission and the Independent Commission Against Corruption—could pass relevant information to the royal commission.

         —The Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service has been established by the Fahey government to inquire into allegations of corrupt activity by police. The Fahey government has had a single-minded determination to inquire into and to root out corruption, where allegations of corruption have been made to it; and the establishment of this royal commission is yet another signal from the government of that determination. It is in marked contrast to the stench which has surrounded previous governments in New South Wales.

         I pay proper respect to Premier Fahey for the initiatives that he has taken, and also of course to former Premier Greiner, who—whilst suffering a personal penalty as a result of the establishment of one such organisation in the past to deal with allegations of corruption—always took a very strong stand on this issue in New South Wales. Since these issues have significance beyond the borders of one state, as the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) has said in his second reading speech, it is important that we recognise the very strong stance taken by the New South Wales government in contrast to some of its predecessors—in particular, the previous Labor administration, which I note is now offering itself for re-election.

         The New South Wales authorities, as I understand it, support this bill; the coalition is unequivocal in its support as well, and we seek the support of all members in the early passage of this legislation. As the minister has said, allegations may include secret transactions involving cash payments or other financial benefits. In this regard there are two Commonwealth statutes which are relevant and which provide a framework for the control of such information and for its usage: in particular, the Financial Transaction Reports Act of 1988 and the Telecommunications (Interception) Act of 1979. To ensure that the royal commission has available to it all relevant information and that the arms of government, both state and federal, are put to the task of supporting the royal commission in its terms of reference, it is proposed by this bill before us to facilitate the provision of certain information to the royal commission. In particular, the bill allows for telephone tap material obtained under warrant to be made available to the commission.

         I suppose it is surprising that some criminals have yet to work out that telephone taps are available to police authorities. Be that as it may, they are a useful source of information—or potentially a useful source of information—for a royal commission of this sort and this bill does allow for that information to be made available to the commission.

         As I have mentioned, the New South Wales government supports the bill. I understand that there has been some comment, apparently from the royal commission itself, as to the way in which this matter ought to be dealt with. In a sense I think that is a technical matter. The policy perspective from my point of view is to ensure that the commission does have the information; whether it obtains the information directly or indirectly through existing federal agencies is a secondary consideration.

         I understand that the government does have plans to include official corruption as a tappable offence, but it is not doing so now simply because it has a pre-set schedule to make further amendments at a later date. I encourage the government to bear in mind the views of the commission to ensure that there is in no sense whatsoever any hindrance to the work of the commission in fulfilling its terms of reference. With those brief words, I offer the coalition's support to this initiative from the government in support of the policy of the New South Wales government and, in particular, we offer support to this royal commission.

         These provisions arise from a review of the ACT electoral legislation, which was conducted by the ACT administration and my department after self-government was granted in 1989. That legislation, the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 and the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988, applied the modified Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to the territory and provided for the Australian Electoral Commission to conduct legislative assembly elections.

         —Absolutely not. I presume the absence of an opposition speaker suggests that the opposition is supporting this very mechanical bill, and I hope that is true because it should, of course. The significance of the Australian Capital Territory Electoral Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 is that it completes the transition to self-government in the ACT, and that is a very important step. The bill is a quite straightforward one of just handing the responsibility for electoral matters over to the ACT government now that it has passed its own legislation. This completes a process that has been going on now for six years, and has involved the progressive transfer of responsibility for all matters for which the ACT now has responsibility over to it. It does so on the basis that this was a necessary step for ensuring that the last part of Australia which did not manage its own affairs was able to do so.

         This step towards self-government was quite controversial in the ACT. There was uncertainty about what it would mean and there was dispute about what the implications were in terms of distribution of power and financial arrangements. But it seemed clear to many people that in a practising democracy it was not reasonable or responsible for one part of the country not to accept responsibility for its own affairs. In a situation where there is a commitment to participatory democracy, it was important that the ACT—after all, the seat of the national parliament—should fit that model as well. That was why many of us pushed hard for self-government and why we are very glad to see it in operation.

         Of course, it has not functioned free of controversy, and some would say it has not functioned perfectly, but it has been a learning experience for the people of the ACT and for the members of the Legislative Assembly. The functioning has progressively improved and that suggests a growing political maturity within the territory. That is exactly what one would expect and would hope for.

This completes the process of transition, and I am glad that the ACT government has now its own electoral act which means that the Commonwealth can withdraw from this area and leave the territory to operate independently and responsibly. I strongly support the bill and I hope, now that the shadow minister is here, that he will do the same.

The main aim of this bill is to amend and repeal those parts of the Commonwealth's ACT self-government legislation which are no longer appropriate, given that the ACT Legislative Assembly has enacted its own legislation covering the conduct of elections and related matters. There now exists an ACT Electoral Commission and its functions and powers are determined by the procedures laid down in the relevant 1992 legislation, as amended in 1994. This bill also makes provision for transitional arrangements dealing with disputed qualifications of members, which are not covered by the ACT's legislation in the period leading up to the 18 February 1995 election, which will soon be upon us.

         Prior to the commencement of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988, which was Commonwealth legislation, the ACT was administered by the Commonwealth through its respective agencies. Debate about a local legislature for the ACT dates back to the time when the seat of government was established here in the 1920s. In October 1988, a package of bills dealing with self-government was introduced into the House of Representatives. After much negotiation regarding the electoral system for the territory, the legislation was passed with amendments in November 1988. A modified d'Hondt system, which provided for a form of proportional representation not previously used in Australia, was established. The system was criticised by the Australian Electoral Commission at the time as being absurd and bizarre.

         The ACT became a separate legal entity from the Commonwealth under the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988, which is, in effect, the constitution of the self-governing polity. The Commonwealth handed over some of its powers to the ACT government while others—such as police and the courts—were transferred over time and, of course, we still have the Commonwealth Federal Police in operation at present. Some legislative powers were reserved to the Commonwealth and were not available to the ACT Legislative Assembly. For example, the assembly could not vary the electoral system.

         The transition to self-government has not been—as mentioned by my predecessor—without problems. The first ACT election held under a modified d'Hondt system took place on 4 March 1989. It proved to be a fiasco. Some 117 candidates stood for 17 positions, there were 108 different parties and nine independents. Apart from the Liberal and Labor parties, there were parties such the Party! Party! Party! Party, the Sun-Ripened Warm Tomato Party and the Surprise Party!. The ballot paper was the biggest ever seen in Australia and the second largest seen in the democratic world.

         Getting the ballot paper into the voting booths proved to be something of a gymnastic feat, given that it was a metre wide. Once in the booth, the voter was confronted with 139 boxes, which led to widespread confusion. Consequently, the informal vote mounted to 5.69 per cent, which is remarkably low, considering that at the last state election in New South Wales the figure was nine to 10 per cent. Nevertheless, it demonstrated at that stage a not inconsiderable public view, disparate though it may have been described at the time, of not being in favour of self-government for the ACT. Those various components of a political process came out in support of that proposition.

         Counting took some nine weeks and it was more than two months from the time of the election before it was determined who had become a member of the Legislative Assembly. Scrutiny of the ballot papers required eight stages and had to be sorted into 209 categories—a massive feat. Understandably, many ACT residents were less than impressed with what occurred.

         In the wake of the election, two inquiries were held into the ACT electoral system. In July 1989, the ACT Legislative Assembly established a select committee on self-government to report on a number of issues, including the electoral process. In November 1989, the Commonwealth parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters presented a report entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Inquiry into the ACT election and electoral system
         </emphasis>
         . Among the recommendations of the ACT Legislative Assembly select committee were that the ACT enact its own electoral act and that a separate electoral office be established in the ACT to administer the legislation, provide policy advice to the ACT government, and conduct public awareness and education campaigns on matters relating to ACT Legislative Assembly matters. In the view of the select committee, full ACT control of its own electoral system was an essential ingredient in a self-government process.

         In 1991, the Commonwealth government introduced the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Amendment Bill. The minister's second reading speech included a commitment to hand over to the ACT the power to control its own electoral system. In the same year, the government also introduced amendments to the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 and the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. This package of legislation enabled the ACT Legislative Assembly to enact electoral legislation specifically for the ACT.

         The Electoral Act 1992 (ACT) was the first stage in the making of the act of the ACT's own electoral laws. It established an electoral commission for the Territory and an independent procedure for the determination of electoral boundaries. The next stage in the process occurred in 1994 when the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1994 (ACT) and the Electoral (Amendment) (Consequential Provisions) Act 1994 were passed by the assembly. The net effect of this has been the construction of parallel mechanisms for running ACT elections—that is, the Commonwealth legislation and the ACT legislation.

Consequently, the ACT Supreme Court can continue to hear any questions of disputed qualifications and casual vacancies—should they arise—until the next ACT general election, when the ACT's own electoral laws will apply.

         Subclause 4(1) also provides that the Australian Capital Territory Electoral Act is not and never has been invalid on the grounds of inconsistency with the Commonwealth's Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988. There are a number of other changes of that nature.

         As the shadow Attorney-General of the Australian Capital Territory, Mr Gary Humphries, has said, it is appropriate that the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly take control of its own electoral system following a decision by the people at referendum in 1992. This referendum involved a choice between single member electorates and the Hare-Clarke voting system with a Robson rotation. Some 67 per cent of Canberrans supported the Hare-Clarke system. There was support for that system from every party, except the ALP, which had previously thought it would have a monopoly over power in the Australian Capital Territory forever.

         After the referendum, a major controversy broke out as Ms Follett, the Chief Minister, attempted, in the view of many people, to undermine the results of the referendum with the Labor Party's proposals. In the event, the ALP was forced to back down. The Australian Capital Territory voting system now reflects the wishes of the vast majority of electors. As we have seen in the past and as we will probably see in the future, the probabilities in the Australian Capital Territory are that the balance of power may well be held by independent members of the chamber. In a sense, this gives the two major parties a reasonably fair prospect of having a share of government over time. This is a considerable improvement over the original proposal which would have given to the Labor Party, and the Labor Party alone, a significant and unfair advantage over other political interests. Consequently, the legislation is supported by the coalition.

         Going to school in the 1950s, as I did, geography and history were an integral part of the curriculum. Everyone of my age knew where Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were and they knew the historical importance of those countries. Fate is rather strange. In the early 1970s I married into a Lithuanian family from Sydney and I quickly gained a new perspective on my versions of world history, coming as I did from an Anglo-Saxon base with a father who, I proudly claim, was one of the original Anzacs. I gained a new perspective into a version of world history, especially concerning Eastern Europe and the choice that people had between the German and Russian domination of that part of the world.

         Then, as a federal parliamentarian, having the chance to visit Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania enabled me and my wife to see places at first hand which were previously only spoken about around the table in Sydney and at my home in Hobart. As I said, I wish to confine my remarks today to our visit to the three countries which are often described as the Baltic states.

         As a result of the vast changes occurring in these countries and the very close links Australians have with them now, and as a result of the parliamentary delegation's visit, I would like to think that we as Australians will come to see these countries as separate entities in their own right rather than being bundled up as the Baltic states. Our delegation's visit could not have been timed more perfectly. The delegation was in these countries just as the Russian troops were finally leaving. Fifty years of Soviet domination and subjugation were finally coming to an end. Our delegation's visit to Estonia, the first of the countries that we visited, coincided with the withdrawal of the remaining Russian troops from that country.

         When we arrived in Estonia we were told that there was a change in the itinerary and that we were being asked to attend a special thanksgiving service. Those of us who were there were very privileged to be at this special thanksgiving service of the church of Kaarli, attended by the Estonian Prime Minister, Mart Laar. This service was one of the special events in my life. None of us understood a word of Estonian but this did not make a scrap of difference. From the fervour of the singing one could sense the feeling in the country and the rejoicing that its people had now gained their freedom. After this rather moving service, bells in all the churches throughout the country rang out to proclaim the news that Estonia was now Estonian, not part of the Soviet Union.

         Just to be part of this enabled all of us to glimpse a little of what was happening throughout Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. For the next several days we were given an insight into life in Estonia as it was under Soviet control, and now as a free and sovereign state. It was evident as we travelled around that housing as we know it was reserved for the privileged few in Estonian society. The vast majority of the people lived in 12- to 15-storey apartment buildings built in the style we jokingly refer to as `Soviet realism'—grey brick which over time has taken on a black hue. Maintenance appeared to have never taken place. Public transport, cheap as it was, was badly in need of being updated.

         Life in the Estonian countryside seemed to have remained in a time warp. There were no fences apparent anywhere. Farm animals were taken out and individually tethered. Farm machinery was rarely seen and vast areas of agricultural land were not being utilised. With the end of collectivisation, the whole farming sector of the economy lacked purpose and direction and the potential for development seemed enormous. Those of us who had some farming connections were amazed at exactly what was not happening in this country.

         Relations with Russia dominate the foreign policy aspects of Estonian life, and this was no more evident than when we had the chance to visit the former military base in Klooga. We quickly sensed, as I said previously, that the Estonians are a very proud race of people. When we were shown the military base in Klooga we were told that this was one of over 500 such bases throughout the country and for the first time in 50 years people were able to see parts of their country for the first time. It was rather difficult for us to understand, being able as we are to travel wherever we like and to see whatever we like, that one-twentieth of this country had been locked away for 50 years and that people were now seeing their own forests, roads, highways, lakes and the like for the first time. There were tears in their eyes when they spoke of it and it rather moved us.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Klooga base had been left by the Russians less than a week before the delegation's visit. It was a wasteland—a scene of total devastation. Buildings on the base had been stripped of all fittings and fixtures, including wiring, hand basins, taps and door handles. The external surrounds had been similarly treated and roadside culverts had been removed where possible. Outlying buildings were littered with waste. There was no guarantee that the base was free from landmines. Accordingly, the delegation was required to walk on specific routes only. Abandoned pets were also in evidence, and they are also a feature of many of the 500 such places throughout Estonia.

         I can assure members that we in the delegation were amazed and bewildered by what we saw at Klooga. As I said, it is one of 500 such places in Estonia. I think there are in excess of 560 in Latvia, and there is probably the same number in Lithuania. This legacy affects these countries. It is a vast problem. Given that these countries are still moving from a command economy to a market economy, there is little realistic prospect of funds being available to clear up these bases. Vast sums will be required before such blots on the landscape can be erased.

         Throughout all these countries, we were confronted with a problem that some of us had no difficulty in understanding: the problem of the Russians still residing in these countries. The question of citizenship and exactly what constitutes an Estonian, Latvian or Lithuanian was raised frequently in our discussions with members of parliament and ministers from all these countries. After 50 years of Soviet domination, and the realisation that these people have now gained their rightful place on the world stage, one can easily understand why many of the people in these countries wish to make the issue of citizenship as stringent as possible, so as to exclude those Russians who have no desire to be a part of these emerging countries.

         However, this desire to stand on their own is tempered by the ever-present realisation that Mother Russia is not all that far away. Knowing of some of the weird and wonderful characters—such as Mr Zhirinovsky—who are espousing Russian domination of these places again, one can understand why people in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are mindful of asserting citizenship rights. But, as I say, mother Russia is not far away. These countries are inextricably linked to Russia for their economic futures, as they are almost totally reliant on Russia for energy supplies—whether they be oil or uranium rods for the power stations that proliferate in their countryside—and for the markets for their exports.

         Each of these countries is different in its own right. I guess Estonia—the first country we visited—had a pretty enormous impact on all of us. Latvia was completely different. It has a huge problem with the Russian presence, in that, after the withdrawal of Russian troops, only 54 per cent of people living in Latvia are Latvians. The rest is made up of Russians, Byelorussians or members of other races. Currently, Latvians are in the minority in the seven largest cities and towns in the country. It was evident from our time in Riga—where one heard more Russian spoken than Latvian—that this is an enormous problem. How can the emerging country, with only 54 per cent of its population Latvians, assert its sovereignty? As I say, many of us could understand why pretty stringent conditions have been put on Latvian, Estonian and Lithuanian citizenship.

         I would now like to briefly turn to our time in Lithuania. I have a Lithuanian wife, who was able to return to the homeland, so it was rather special for us. It was a chance for my wife to practice her fluent Lithuanian, and she enjoyed the role of interpreter when we were able to visit parts of the countryside. It was also rather special to have permission to make a slight detour on our way to Kaunas, to visit Jonova—the town where her parents were born—and to have a quick glimpse of the countryside around there.

         We had the privilege of going to the radio station, which is not dissimilar to Black Mountain Tower. To see the 13 crosses around the radio station and the display inside the radio station is to understand that those 13 crosses symbolise the places where 13 proud Lithuanians of all ages died for their country, in an attempt to stop the Soviet army seizing the radio station when Lithuania declared its independence.

The Hill of Crosses is a symbol also of Lithuanian independence.

We had the pleasure of spending a couple of hours there and it was a moving experience to see these two young girls who, with no money but with all the will in the world, convinced the ministers for education and community services and health in Lithuania to deinstitutionalise, almost overnight, all the young people with disabilities and to set up a program for these children and for their parents. This was moving evidence of the links that we have established. With those few words, I am pleased to support the report.

         I would like to speak briefly to one or two points from the report, firstly in relation to the Baltic states, and to expand a little on one or two points that the honourable member for Franklin has made. The first point that impressed all of us about the Baltic states was commitment to democracy by the peoples of those three countries. Let nobody misjudge what they are about—they are totally committed to democracy, to democratic processes, to the processes of parliament. In all three countries we saw, albeit at varying stages of development, parliaments being firmly established and governance being firmly established.

         The peoples of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania can justifiably be proud of what they have achieved since 1991, when their move into democratic processes really started. As the honourable member for Franklin has said, that was not without a certain degree of bloodshed. We saw evidence, direct and indirect, of that while we were in those three countries.

         I pay tribute to the peoples of those three countries for their commitment. Yes, they have a few major challenges ahead of them. In those three countries the inflation rate was running at about 1,000 per cent in 1991. To bring that back—as they have all, I think—to double figures, around 20 to 25 per cent at this point in time, is a major achievement. We, as part of the international community, should be doing everything we can on a bilateral and a multilateral basis to assist them in moving further along the path of democratic progress.

         The second point I would like to make in relation to the three countries is something that was referred to by the honourable member for Franklin—the Russian legacy. Let there be no doubt about it, there are still a lot of reservations about the Russians in all three countries, perhaps more prominently in Estonia and Latvia than in Lithuania, the last named having a rather more pragmatic approach to the bilateral relationship with the emerging Russian Federation. But it is posing some problems. As the honourable member said, that is exemplified in the citizenship legislation which continues to bounce around within the domestic political environment of those three countries. I think it is something which will put a few pressures on the democratic processes in all three of those countries, but I have every confidence that they will be able to overcome them and move onwards and upwards.

         In Estonia, we were scheduled to visit the former Soviet nuclear naval base west of Tallinn. For reasons known only to those in Estonia, the day before we got there it was decided that we were not allowed to visit. The official reason given was that they were withdrawing the rods from the two nuclear reactors which had formed the basis of a simulated submarine at that nuclear naval base. That disappointed a number of us.

         Nevertheless, having, as a replacement for that, visited the former armoured brigade camp at a place called Klooga, some earlier views that we had been given about the impact of the former Soviet military forces in those countries were reinforced. We were all made speechless by what we saw. I do not pull punches in referring to the environmental vandalism that has resulted from that Soviet occupation. I will say a little bit more about that in a moment. We were all almost speechless once we had seen Klooga.

         —It is hard to believe, yes. I have strong reservations—I hope they are unfounded—about the position of the people of Estonia in terms of the residual radiation that may emerge from the Tallinn naval base, especially if the environmental standards are the same level as those we saw in the more conventional warfare base at Klooga. I put those reservations on the

         For the next couple of years the Russians will have an early warning ballistic missile radar station in Latvia at a place called Skrunda. That is causing some political pressures within Latvia. I hope that can be resolved and that finally, in a year or two, that facility will be dismantled and the Russian military will withdraw.

         In terms of the military situation in Lithuania and the pressures that are being applied and have been applied, the Lithuanians do not have any Russian military personnel on their soil; nevertheless—through the back door—they were forced to give transit rights to the Russian Federation, to the military enclave at Kaliningrad. Kaliningrad is the most highly militarised enclave in Europe, as the report has said. Something between 40,000 and 140,000 Russian troops—depending on who is speaking—are still there.

         The transit rights through Lithuania were negotiated as a result of pressures applied on that country by the Russian Federation in terms of most favoured nation trade status. I think that is to be deplored in many ways but nevertheless, being very pragmatic about it, the Lithuanian people have accepted it. My only comment would be that I hope that progressively the traffic from west to east—in other words from the Baltic into Byelorussia and into the Russian Federation—will increase rather than decrease.

         I would like to mention one other matter, something that was mentioned by the honourable member for Franklin. He would agree with me, and indeed our wives who were with us felt the same way, that the most moving experience during the whole of our travels was the visit to the living skills centre in Vilnius. There we met two young ladies, both of Lithuanian origin, who had set up in 1991 a centre for intellectually handicapped people.

         In terms of that visit to the Baltic states, the visit to the Hill of Crosses was also a very moving experience. As you may or may not know, in Estonia and Latvia the dominant religion is the Lutheran religion whilst in Lithuania 93 per cent are of the Roman Catholic faith. Mr Deputy Speaker, in my view the two things that held those three countries together during the Soviet occupation were, firstly, their faith in their own peoples and, secondly, their religious faith.

The Soviets attempted, over and over again during their occupation, to bulldoze the area, only to find that within days it was restored. That indicates the commitment that those Baltic people had.

         The report is quite lengthy and detailed and I thought that, rather than referring at length today to what is already printed in it, I might just make mention of a few areas that I thought were of particular importance. The goodwill that has developed between these countries and Australia should never be underestimated. I was particularly pleased to note that, in all our formal meetings, it was quite obvious that Australia was regarded highly. Malcolm Fraser, in particular, came in for some very complimentary mentions along the way. These relationships and friendships should be built on, as we will all benefit from them. Australia is still a most fortunate country and, if we can be of assistance as role models as far as democracy is concerned and of assistance more practically, then we are doing our bit for that part of the world.

         The previous speaker, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), in reporting on his delegation, mentioned the feminisation of poverty, something that was also most obvious to members of this delegation. It was amazing to consider the number of women with whom we met who were very favourably impressed that an Australian delegation could have a woman as deputy leader. Although it had not occurred to me when I left Australia that that was important, it was certainly important to them, and perhaps it is something that can be thought about in future.

         It was also obvious to me that we live in a very small world, and I was reminded of the ease with which friendships can be developed. When the IPU conference met last year in Canberra I attended the day that was devoted to women. The member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) had asked each of the women members of the Australian parliament to host a table for lunch. I had the great pleasure of sitting opposite Edna Mnangagwa, who is now assistant education minister in Zimbabwe. Edna and I got on famously and I showed her my office; we exchanged addresses but did not really get around to communicating after that. Of course, on that occasion that we had lunch together I did not think for one moment that I would be visiting Harare or would have the opportunity to meet up with Edna again so that we could chat and update each other on what had been happening.

Julian Stefani attended a conference recently where he met Margaret Dongo, who is a member of the parliament in Zimbabwe, and Margaret was able to pass on to him good wishes to be conveyed to me, which he certainly did. Again, I was reminded of what a small world it is. Just the other night several of us had dinner with the President of the Senate here as the legal committee from Zimbabwe was entertained. Again, messages were able to be exchanged with people we had met in Harare, and I think that this all contributes to a much better relationship between the two countries.

         In the report we mentioned Australian aid, which I think has been a subject which from time to time comes up for debate. There were some comments made some time ago as to what regions of the world our aid should be channelled into. All members of the delegation that visited southern Africa, I think, are of the view that southern Africa, not only for trade but also for aid, should be considered as a region. In the report we have come up with areas that we consider it would be important to give attention to. It is not necessarily demanding of a lot of money, but it is appropriate that our expertise be put into these areas.

         We have developed significant expertise in some areas in Australia which would be particularly beneficial to this area. Those areas include AIDS education—and I will come back to that in a few moments—the training of medical and counselling staff, veterinary science, dry land farming, use of solar energy technology, computerisation of taxation and electoral records, which they do not have there at all, collection of census information, trade union training, vocational and trade training, senior secondary education, business education, remote education, mining technology, national park management and sports coaching.

         The one that gets first mention and is of particular interest to me is AIDS education. Before I went to this part of the world I had certainly heard of the high incidence of AIDS. But when one gets there one sees that it is not just out in remote areas: it is in the cities; it is in the highly civilised areas. Of course, there are no accurate records in many of these areas, but several of us visited the Princess Marina Hospital in Botswana where we met with the surgical registrar and his colleagues, a physician and also a paediatrician.

         They do have some very reliable information there, and the statistics on AIDS sufferers are quite frightening: 10 per cent of the whole population, 25 per cent of the sexually active population and in some communities up to 35 per cent. Very often the first indication of the problem is when a very small baby is admitted. Then it is discovered that the mother, and perhaps one of the other children, is HIV positive. The father does not really want to be tested and thinks that a mosquito could well be responsible. The expertise that we have developed in this area is something that could well represent a major input from us.

         On the same subject we met with Dr Stamps, the health minister in Zimbabwe. He was able to pull condoms out of his pocket to show that he was aware of the problems. Apart from anything else, it is a cultural problem. The disease is affecting the heterosexual community there and this should be a lesson for the rest of the world. There should be a selfish reason for our interest and our desire to help because AIDS does not know about international or state boundaries. Areas in the world such as Australia which are certainly way out in front and which have this under control to a large extent have a vested interest in assisting here, quite apart from any humanitarian reasons.

         I would like to mention a few stories along the way because I think they will give some flavour to the trip. I was certainly moved by the degree of forgiveness and reconciliation which was apparent in every one of those countries which we visited. In Harare, we met with the justice minister, Mr Emerson Munangagwa. He had given us a very good formal briefing in the afternoon. He happened to be sitting next to me at dinner and I asked him where he had studied law. I discovered he had studied law when he was in prison. He was in prison before the age of 18. If he had been 18, he would have hung. He gave me some details about some of the torture he had experienced during his 10 years in gaol: for the first three years, he was in solitary confinement. He told me of his elation at independence and of some of the reforms that he was able to achieve as justice minister. Prisoners are now given soap and clothing. One of the first things he did was to promote his torturers as a sign of his forgiveness. I found this example quite extraordinary and something that I had not come across before, and I found this to be consistent through the other countries that we visited.

Mr Mbeki was in gaol for 20 years and the person who signed his release from prison was Mr Coetsee when he was correctional services minister in 1988. When they wish to converse now and they do not want others to know what they are talking about, they talk in Latin.

The high commissioner travelled with the delegation through Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana. It is fashionable for media to be critical of the appointment of former politicians to diplomatic posts or other jobs but, interestingly, the same criticism is never made when serving defence personnel take on jobs as governors or other such appointments.

         In my 12 years in parliament I have been on the occasional delegation and made the occasional overseas trip. Let me state categorically that I have never been briefed as fully as I was by the high commissioner to Zimbabwe. Not only did he have a feel for the countries but he also had excellent local contacts and, in his own diplomatic way, he very skilfully assisted the delegation. I believe that we benefited immeasurably by his assistance. I also believe that Australia is very well served by having him as our high commissioner to not only Zimbabwe but also the other countries. The many years of experience that he gained as President of the Senate, his involvement with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, his understanding and—I might say—love of Africa makes him an exceptional high commissioner for this part of the world.

Zimbabwe is, I believe, one of the successes of Africa. The country has its problems, but then what country does not.

         Namibia was, for many of us, the highlight of the tour in that it was so totally unexpected—from the modern city of Windhoek to the spectacular sandhill formations. The great hospitality and friendship extended gave each of us a determination to revisit the country. Our visit to Botswana was too brief to make a fully detailed appraisal but, again, we were shown great hospitality and friendship. We were impressed with Botswana's approach to tourism, especially in respect of the Okavango Swamp area.

The difficulty for South Africa will be fulfilling the sometimes unrealistically high expectations of the majority of the population. The aspects that struck me most were not only the spirit of forgiveness, which the honourable member for Adelaide has already mentioned—I think it is a particularly African trait which we most certainly do not have in this country—but also the desire of people on all sides of the political spectrum to make the current system work. It will be difficult and there will be setbacks but in the end southern Africa and its people will triumph.

         When South Africans woke on 30 April this year, if formal apartheid was no longer in existence, the social and economic symbols were still there, and in many respects remain—as, indeed, does the system within the bureaucracy. We had first-hand experience of this when we were to meet a group at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a round table discussion chaired by Mr D. Laubschur, Chief Director of the Southern Africa Branch. When we arrived as a delegation and were met at the foreign ministry building in Pretoria we were escorted to the office of the former ambassador to Australia, Mr Tothill, famous for his articles in the

         Among the many interesting things Mr Tothill said was that Australia had missed the boat in regard to a relationship with South Africa because of our attitude to the former white regime. I personally do not accept this, and feel that the strong anti-apartheid stand Australia took, as the member for Adelaide said, on both sides of the political spectrum, and the many formal and informal contacts we have with South Africa, will ensure a meaningful relationship between Australia and the new democratic South Africa.

         In my view, our diplomatic representatives in South Africa went a little overboard with security. I know it is difficult for them with parliamentary delegations, and I suppose it would cause an incident if something happened to a member of a parliamentary delegation. Security is often a problem, and it is a problem in South Africa, but in many respects we were prisoners, albeit it in airconditioned luxury, in both Cape Town and Johannesburg. We were not allowed out.

         Of particular interest to me were the national archives of each of the countries we visited. I was fortunate to visit them all, and with my colleague the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) I visited the archives in South Africa. I would suggest that for a very small outlay Australia could play a significant role in assisting with the archival activities in each of these countries. For example, in Zimbabwe there is difficulty with obtaining foreign currency to allow archivists to travel overseas for training. Namibia is in need of assistance with personnel, and the same is true with Botswana. We could assist with the training of archivists and the provision of facilities in both countries, although I must say that I was most impressed with the way the archives were maintained in sometimes trying and difficult situations in both Namibia and Botswana. The South African archives are well run, on professional lines, and I am sure our national archives will maintain regular contact with them.

         —I will enjoy joining in this particular debate about the delegation to southern Africa. It was with some trepidation that I joined this delegation, but I was lucky enough to do that. We were given a briefing prior to going which suggested that it was going to be a high security risk area to go to, and my colleagues from the other side who were going with me were renowned as `comrades'—I guess that is the best terminology—but they turned out to be very good friends as well as comrades.

         What surprised me is something that the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) has mentioned. Although the region is still a bit unstable, the security aspect was not highly noticeable in our trip around the place. Certainly among the people that we spoke to, the reconciliation aspect was very good.

         My general feeling is that the whole southern African region is one of high opportunity for Australia. Certainly in the former front-line states of Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia there are huge opportunities for us in trade and also in other dealings—in particular in aid, but also in intellectual areas such as information systems and education.

         What impressed me most in those front-line areas was Namibia. Although Namibia has been independent for four years, what surprised and disappointed me most is that we have not had one trade person contact the chamber of commerce in all that time. I note that the Western Australian government is taking a trade delegation to the southern African region and is including Namibia in its trip, which will be good.

         I believe that specific areas of information systems present a huge opportunity for computer systems in that particular region. In Botswana I was surprised to see very few computer terminals in the parliament and in government offices. We were told at one stage that the tax system in Botswana is still done manually. It totally surprised me that, in this information technology world, we have tax systems still being done manually. Another area that we can work on in southern Africa is that of education—not only in providing resources, but also in providing the expertise in planning and curriculum development. They are very short on that expertise, particularly in Namibia and Botswana. We have an opportunity there of exporting our knowledge in curriculum development.

         Another area of opportunity concerns air links.

If we were to develop more air links between the two regions, we would be developing tourism as a two-way area.

         I noticed some matters over there which were of concern. The honourable member for Adelaide mentioned health and, in particular, AIDS.

         There was another area of concern for me in South Africa. We travelled to a township called Alexandria. Alexandria is a place of one square kilometre and there are about 300,000 people living in that square kilometre. They live in an array of different housing, mostly lean-tos or shacks. We went to a community hall which had, I think, 200 people living in it. Being the tallest member of the delegation, I was able to look down to observe the living conditions of people there. They had wardrobes facing each other and cardboard boxes and they had passageways into each little family area. Inside, I saw four or five people sitting or lying round in something the size of a double bed. There were 200 people living in this particular community hall and there were sanitary problems—toilets and things like that were not very good.

         It was a humbling experience to go to Alexandria, but the shining light about this place was that we went to a community centre which had a community hall and also a library. What was disappointing about this particular library was that most of the shelves were empty. People were looking for books to fill the shelves. It must be pleasing to my delegation comrades to know that I have started up an appeal in my own electorate to get some high quality, hardcover books from primary schools and to get them over there. They are not just children's books but technical books and also non-fiction books.

         over, comrade. It would not be a problem at all. My first delegation was a very gruelling delegation. We were away for about 21 days. Of those 21 days, we had three days off and those three days were fully structured as well. I must commend the leader for his discipline on the trip—he had everyone arriving on time. My colleague the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) showed a lot of patience and a lot of humour, especially towards hotel staff and during checkouts and things like that.

         It was a good trip. I think everyone enjoyed it. The highlight of the trip was the farewell dinner in Namibia. The leader of the delegation and the deputy leader spoke and then a couple of other people got up and spoke. It was a particular highlight. Another highlight was the visit we made to Vice-President Nkomo in Zimbabwe. He was a very friendly chap. He gave us a rendition of some of his favourite songs.

          —It is probably an understatement to say that there is some confusion surrounding the calculation of the Child Support Agency's collection rate. In order to clear it up, we need to have some explanations. Let me give the Committee some examples. Firstly, the child support scheme fact sheet supplied to the committee by the Department of Social Security states that 75 per cent of liabilities registered with the CSA are being collected. I might add that a private collection arrangement under the law needs to be registered. Secondly, in its supplementary submission to the committee which was received on 30 June 1994, the CSA states that the overall collection rate of 73 per cent in July 1993 has improved to 75 per cent in May 1994. First off we have liabilities registered; now we are talking about a collection rate.

          Thirdly, the ministerial statement issued on 5 December states that in 1994-94 the CSA collected an amount equal to 75 per cent of the liabilities raised. In the House, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) said on 6 December that the CSA collected 75 per cent of net liabilities. In addition, since the scheme has started, the CSA has collected 68 per cent of all debt. It is unclear to me, and I think to the committee, where the collection rate applies. Does it apply to all those cases registered with the CSA? Does it apply to all liabilities? If so, what are they? Does it apply to net liabilities? If so, what are they? What is the overall amount of debt—is it an overall amount of debt, or is it an annualised debt? I am happy to plead to some confusion. I hope the Committee might understand that with these different terms being applied at different times there is a degree of confusion.

          I want to place on record some thanks, because when one tables a report one does not get that opportunity. In particular, I want to extend my thanks to Michael Carmody, the head of the Australian Taxation Office, and Moira Scollay. It is my belief that the committee has been privileged to receive very good cooperation from them. I also want to say something about the staff of the CSA. Firstly, they were very generous, because the committee was able to go around to quite a number of agency offices and on each and every occasion we had an opportunity to sit down with staff and to discuss the problems as they saw them. I have no doubt that the Child Support Agency is staffed by very genuine people who are working extremely hard in an area that I am the first to admit is very difficult and very complex.

          I guess I have made the point in the report that I have felt that the staff have been forced in some ways to try to exercise their role with one hand behind their back. I also wish to acknowledge that since the inquiry has started there has been a whole myriad of changes that have either been piloted or commenced in the agency. I have never been backward in wanting to offer my congratulations and support for these changes. I would say that the committee's report has created quite a number of challenges for the staff, and that we have really set the bar very high. If the recommendations of this committee are adopted by the agency and successfully implemented, it will be performing at the highest possible level.

I would be less than honest if I did not report that I very much appreciated those exercises and that they did cause me to reflect on a number of points. I want to reinforce what I have said, that the agency has sought to cooperate fully with the inquiry and it has made the committee's work a lot easier than it might otherwise have been. As can be seen in my comments about the collection rate, there are still some difficulties either in reporting or language that we need to overcome. I will be looking forward to the explanation of the different terminologies.

It was a very complex inquiry and I do not think their role was made any easier by some of the demands I placed on them, but I would certainly like to acknowledge the depth and the quality of the work that has gone into the report. There is another member of the committee present and it would be unfair if I did not acknowledge the fact that there were nine other members of this committee who signed up for a very difficult task. It is pleasing to report that, whilst no member can stand up and claim to have achieved 100 per cent of what he or she sought out of the report, the report does, with one dissenting report, constitute a consensus amongst the committee—and not a consensus that is at the lowest common denominator, a consensus that I think reflects the best traditions of parliamentary inquiry.

          Firstly, in a case where the number of children with the custodial parent is two and the non-custodial parent has no new or adopted children or is in fact single, the non-custodial parent's income is $20,000 and the CP is a sole supporting pensioner at zero income, what would be the changes that the formula would put in place? It is true that the NCP would pay $430 less but still, on $20,000, have a commitment to pay $2,821. The change to the CP annually would be $216. As to the relative disposable income—again the NCP earning $20,000, the CP on supporting parent's pension—the NCP would have a disposable income, after tax, Medicare and child support, of $14,129; the custodial parent's disposable income would be $15,598.70.

          It is always useful to provide honourable members with examples of the implications of the proposed modelling changes to the formula. Again I caution honourable members not to do what the ministerial statement has done, which is to seize upon one recommendation and extrapolate from that, but to look at the report as a whole.

          For those that are involved in the trauma of separation and break-up—or in examining their entrails, as the committee was—I must say that it is a pity that we do not have a positive reference. So much government action, so much government interest and so many government dollars go into the damage end of relationships. No-one in the Committee, I am sure, pretends that we can wave a magic wand and make separations disappear or go away. I certainly do not pretend that I or the committee possess such power. But I do say we have got the proportions all wrong. It is an absolute tragedy that the committee does not have a reference to look at the way in which we may provide positive support to families, or to those people in long-term relationships.

          During very intense discussion on many aspects of the scheme members of the committee became very aware of the complexity of the arrangement. We were not looking at just the child support formula; we had to look at the issue of child support in relation to the Family Law Act and the Department of Social Security arrangements, so that at all times we were aware that this was a very difficult inquiry. We are very much indebted to the secretariat, which provided a huge amount of analysis and work. Departments also responded to our requests, even when that took some little time. The modelling from the Department of Social Security,

The committee's recommendations need to be seen as part of a package of reforms, so I hope that the government will not just pick up on a couple of items in our recommendations, as unfortunately it has in initial media releases. The package of reforms brings in interrelationships between the Family Law Act, property settlements and the availability of existing government support and income support for families. No members of the committee have walked away from the core issue of this very important legislation: that both parents have responsibility to maintain and support their children, irrespective of what happens in their relationship.

          As the Chair of the committee, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), has said, it would be wrong to say that people came in with a particular mandate. It is true that as elected representatives and senators we have many constituents coming to our offices complaining about various aspects of this scheme. It is true that in our public hearings we had many non-custodial parents who were motivated to come along and express their serious concern. We sought to balance those concerns with the concerns of custodial parents.

          In 1987 when I was working professionally in a mining town I had a number of high income earners on $60,000 to $80,000 a year who were paying possibly less than $20 a week, the maximum income that a single parent could receive before it affected his or her pension. This was obviously unjust, placed a significant burden on other taxpayers and led to an increasing number of sole parents falling well below the poverty line. There is no doubt that the child support legislation has required parents to assume their responsibilities. Indeed, there has been a major change in social attitudes in terms of acknowledging that responsibility.

          In most cases, non-custodial parents who appeared before the committee acknowledged and admitted their responsibility. Their concern was in relation to the burden that the current formula placed on them. One of the recommendations that we have made is an attempt in our modification of the formula to provide a slight degree of equity and justice between custodial and non-custodial parents.

          Although modelling from the Department of Social Security indicated that non-custodial parents were always better off, it was very hard to relate that to the evidence in submissions, through our hotline, and in public evidence, where non-custodial parents said that they were not able to afford to maintain themselves after they had fulfilled their child support obligations and that they were often forced to live with their parents or be supported by partners or friends. That is not a situation that is conducive to ex-marital harmony—if we can put it that way—and to the development of positive parenting relationships following the breakdown of marriage.

          One of the issues that I was always concerned about in my professional work was to indicate clearly to parents that, irrespective of what happened to their relationship, the one relationship that was never going to change was that they were parents to their children.

          There is no doubt that the burdens and stresses associated with the amount of child support non-custodial parents have been paying and the relationship with the Child Support Agency have had a negative effect on those adjustments, which I think all members of this House would acknowledge are very difficult. One of the great challenges for the Child Support Agency when it was set up was that its workers were not used to dealing with traumatised individuals in this particular way.

          What happened, and what caused a great deal of hostility on the part of non-custodial parents, was that after having dealt with the early trauma of the breakdown, and often making arrangements, transferring funds, agreeing to cover bankcard debts, giving the custodial parent maybe the car or the house, and having a number of costs in terms of early resettlement, they would then receive an unreadable letter from the Child Support Agency which would indicate their liability and often a considerable debt because of the delay in processing the application.

We are here to collect money for custodial parents.' The perception that the Child Support Agency was down on non-custodial parents gained wide currency. Certainly, the reforms that we are suggesting in terms of the way the agency handles its business and some of the reforms that have already been put in place by the Australian Taxation Office will assist that process.

          However, we did feel, as a committee, that there needed to be changes to aspects of the formula. One of the contentious issues—and it was referred to by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) yesterday in his answer in the House—is the cap on the high income earners. It was originally recommended by the consultative group that that be set at twice average weekly earnings. One of the reasons it appears to have been changed before the legislation came into effect was the cost to parents of going back to court to seek a review.

          —The Department of Social Security, in its letter to the committee dated 12 May, designated the number of non-custodial parents as being 472. Although it may appear that in reducing the cap we are actually giving high income earners a free go, it has become a severe disincentive. In fact, it becomes a transfer of assets to the non-custodial ex-partner. In many cases, those high income earners are willing and able to provide income support for their children in the way of school fees, health insurance and so on. Our recommendations for flexibility will allow non-custodial parents to have more say in the way that the transfers are made. Non-custodial parents will be able to direct a proportion of their income support without the consent of the custodial parent and a high degree with the consent of the custodial parent, allowing them more involvement in the way the moneys are spent.

          The committee did not agree with the submissions from some non-custodial parents that they should have full control over the way their child support is spent. There is a group of non-custodial parents who want to continue to control and dominate their ex-partners, and we do not want to see child support payments used to control and harass custodial parents.

          It is very important to provide some relief at the high income end so that there is not total disincentive. The committee believes that the disregarded income level and the self-support component should be balanced. To tell non-custodial parents that we will give them the equivalent of the dole after they have worked very hard and before we take into consideration their child support responsibilities would be seen by non-custodial parents as discriminatory. Although the amount has not been raised very much, at 1.2 per cent of the pension it will give some measure of relief. At the same time, we recommend that the disregarded income for custodial parents be reduced from average weekly earnings plus the child care component. Effectively this means that the contribution by custodial parents will not be taken into account until they achieve an income of approximately $34,000 to $37,000. That range covers very few custodial parents. We feel that it is more effective to bring the level down to the pension cut-off point, and then to ease down to 50c in the dollar the amount by which the child support withdrawal is calculated.

In many respects this is an amazing report. Here is a report of a joint parliamentary committee to which 6,197 submissions were received. That is a record number of submissions in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia.

          This report is about an operation of government which has been the subject, in terms of the size of the agency, of more complaints to the Commonwealth Ombudsman than any other agency in the Commonwealth of Australia. Almost every member of this parliament at one stage or another over the last few years has made reference to or raised complaints about, either publicly in the chamber or privately with the minister concerned on behalf of constituents, the way in which the Child Support Agency has operated since its inception.

On that basis alone, I would have thought that it was a report which the responsible ministers of government would have said, on the basis of anecdotal experience, is something that we ought to take careful consideration of. To that one can add a further dimension, and that is that the joint select committee comprises members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives and embodies a range of opinions, political and otherwise. It does not simply reflect the division in this place between the Labor and the non-Labor side of politics. It reflects an ideological spectrum even within those divisions of Labor and non-Labor.

          The report runs to some 687 pages. Other than in relation to a couple of matters raised by one senator in a dissenting report, it is a unanimous report of this committee.

          Having this background of the Child Support Agency which has been complained about vigorously and quite loudly by many constituents and complained about on their behalf by many members of parliament, and having a report which was 18 months in the drafting, one would have expected that this was an amazing situation which would have led to some sort of response from the government. It could have said, for example, `We note the work that has been undertaken by the committee. There are a lot of serious matters that need resolution and further thought and consideration and that will be given in due course.' As members of the committee, we would have hoped that a rider would have been added saying that that would have been done as soon as possible.

I could not have read this report and understood it in 24 hours. We have read and re-read and drafted and redrafted and found fine nuances in particular aspects or in aspects of the complexity of the law. We went over the complications of the matters over and over again and we talked about and discussed and reworded to come up with this report after 18 months of reading submissions and listening to many people around the country; yet we have this amazing situation of a response from two members of the government in relation to this—and I suspect they are out of kilter, even with most of their colleagues—within less than 24 hours, about 12 hours.

          I think this really points to the problem that the people who made submissions to this report are going to have to deal with. It has been pointed out quite clearly by my colleagues on the other side that this is a package of recommendations. There is not one member of the joint select committee who will not say that this was a package of recommendations, because quite clearly it is. They are recommendations which must be seen in the light of being a package and being integrated with each other. We cannot simply pluck one out and say, `I don't like that so I am not going to deal with that but I might deal with something else.' It is like a stack of cards or a house of cards; if one is pulled out, others fall down. As a consequence, on that basis the whole report would be a total waste of time. Given that there is this broad support from the committee which was charged with the responsibility of listening to the concerns of the community about the Child Support Agency, I have to say that this is a totally amazing response—12 hours later to be writing off parts of this. I invite; I urge; I implore the ministers concerned to go back and have a look at it again rather than give this knee-jerk reaction that we have got at the present time.

          In the speech I made when the chair tabled this report, I criticised the Department of Social Security. I think this is part of the problem. I want to take that criticism a bit further today. What I said was that the evasiveness of the Department of Social Security in much of its evidence to the committee was such that, had that evidence been given in a court of law, a judge would be constrained to direct the jury to consider whether or not that evidence was biased and self-serving. Now I did not say that without some support in the report itself. I want to refer briefly to certain passages of the report where that statement is clearly backed up by what is in the report.

In particular, given that the membership of the main body responsible for the evaluation of the performance of the Scheme, the Child Support Evaluation Advisory Group (CSEAG), was exclusively drawn from membership of the Consultative Group whose report,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Child Support, Formula for Australia
         </emphasis>
         (1988), was critical in the establishment of formula assessment under Stage 2 of the Scheme, the Joint Committee was immediately concerned over the impartiality of CSEAG's findings. Upon examination of CSEAG's evaluation reports, these concerns unhappily proved to be well founded. The Joint Committee discovered that the only major survey which evaluated the impact of the Scheme virtually overlooked the financial situation of non custodial parents and subsequent families. Furthermore, CSEAG's analysis in respect of key components of the child support formula such as the custodial parent disregarded income level was grossly inadequate.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         We go on to say that the chapter sets out some views in relation to future evaluations. I wish to read a couple of other paragraphs from chapter 22, because they reinforce what I have said, and what I believe is the problem as it has been illustrated in terms of the response that has been made by the ministers to date. In paragraph 22.5 of the report we say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Any future evaluation of the child support Scheme must be seen to be truly independent and outside the influence of the departments with policy responsibility for the Scheme, as well as any other parties who have played a significant role in the establishment of the Scheme or in any past evaluation of it. In this way any future evaluations of the Scheme will be publicly seen to be truly independent thereby ensuring public confidence in the results of these evaluations and the Scheme is generally enhanced.
        </para>
        <para>
         And in the following paragraph, 22.6, we say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Joint Committee notes the Department of Social Security (DSS) dominates the policy aspects of the Scheme whilst the Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS) has been the major body assisting with the evaluations of the Scheme. Neither DSS or the AIFS could be considered to be at `arms length' to the Scheme and the Joint Committee considers that any future evaluation should be conducted at arms length from both organisations.
        </para>
        <para>
         Then we go on to suggest a way in which that could be done. Finally, to reinforce the point, in paragraph 22.13 we say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Joint Committee notes that the modelling of the impact of the Child Support Scheme is monopolised by DSS. As highlighted in Chapter 4, DSS has a direct financial interest in the Scheme and consequently is far from disinterested in the outcomes produced by its modelling of the impact of the Scheme. This potential conflict of interest is exacerbated by the fact that the clients of DSS under the Scheme are sole parent pensioners who represent over 90 per cent of custodial parents under the Scheme. Consequently, the Joint Committee considers that the public confidence in the Scheme can be best served by DSS commissioning an independent party to conduct all future modelling of the impact of the Scheme on the relative disposable incomes of both parents.

         So, Mr Deputy Speaker, the evidence in the report is quite clear, and the recommendations which are endorsed by all members of the joint select committee are quite clear from reading these paragraphs of the report. The problem here is that we have a scheme which was basically devised by, and implemented within, a policy section of the Department of Social Security; that reviews and evaluations of the scheme up until the one by the joint select committee were largely conducted or influenced by that same policy section of the Department of Social Security; and that now we have that same policy section of the Department of Social Security presumably giving the ministers advice about the way in which they should react to this scheme.

          This comes back to what I think is a fundamental misunderstanding about the problems which arise in relation to the Child Support Agency, because it seems to me that there has been an attempt to set up two groups of parents against each other as if there were a conflict that they were at war with each other about. The two groups of parents are custodial parents and non-custodial parents. Other members of the committee have spoken about the tragedy and the emotional trauma of marriage breakdown and divorce, and what we need to try and do to deal with that. I do not have time to speak about that today, except to endorse those remarks.

          It is a nonsense to suggest that these two groups of parents are somehow in conflict with each other and that the way we enhance the position of one group is by somehow putting aside the rights and position of the other. Overwhelmingly, the complaint of non-custodial parents was that in many circumstances their particular financial arrangements were not being taken into account. We have mountains of evidence about that so it is a nonsense to simply dismiss it out of hand. A group of custodial parents said that it was simply impossible to get payments from some of their former spouses. Those two groups are not in conflict with each other; they are two separate sets of problems. This response, which reeks of saying that there is a conflict, is one which is simply not credible. I urge the ministers to withdraw their remarks and consider the matter.

         —People sometimes question the outcomes of international conferences, especially huge conferences such as the United Nations International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo from 5 September to 13 September this year: are they huge talkfests or do meaningful achievements come from them? I suppose, in all honesty, it is a combination of both. There are endless speeches of varying quality and there is a certain amount of political point scoring or governments pushing their own particular line, but there are also some achievements and some meaningful outcomes—not always immediate, but meaningful nevertheless.

         A world population in excess of five billion, growing by about 90 million each year, has been of increasing concern to many people for some years. What did come out of Cairo—I think it is true to say this—is that population growth is now viewed as a matter of global concern. I also feel that many people are now looking at population in a wider context, in that it can no longer be seen as a problem which can be tackled in isolation from social and economic conditions. Population must be seen as part of an overall global, economic and environmental problem.

         There was also much discussion about abortion and I might say that the Catholic Church played a most unhelpful role. No-one at Cairo, or anywhere, was advocating abortion as a means of family planning. It was being said that where abortion is conducted it must be carried out in a proper medical and hygienic manner. Indeed, for some time it seemed that the Vatican was advocating backstreet abortions. Perhaps the negative stand of the Catholic Church on family planning will not change until there are a few women in the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. Ageing men, wandering around in drag, are hardly competent to pontificate on how women should control their fertility.

         Of course one of the issues that caused most concern, indeed fright to many delegates, was the issue of empowering women. Many of the male delegates were prepared to agree to the mainstream views of the conference until it came to the question of the empowerment of women. This was too much for many of them but to me the issue seems quite straightforward: until we empower women and take away barriers such as illiteracy and economic dependency the world will make no progress on the population question.

         One is aware of cultural differences and it is not acceptable for the West, or Australia, to put value judgments on other parts of the world. This is where I take issue with many of my colleagues, even in this House. There is a tendency for us, as politicians, to pontificate on the national or international scheme to impose our moral judgments on others. There is absolutely nothing to indicate that politicians are in any position to impose their value judgments, or their morality, on any other section of the community and we should resist the temptation to do this.

         In Cairo, there was much discussion concerning respect for religious, ethical and cultural considerations. This, for me, caused a great difficulty because, while respecting religious, ethical and cultural considerations, nevertheless, if we are going to make any progress, these are the very considerations that, in many respects, have to be challenged.

         For many people, it is a cultural matter that women have no rights and are not treated equal to men.

         Less than 100 years ago, it was a cultural tradition that women in China had their feet bound. It took many people much effort to challenge this cultural tradition and have it changed. The same could apply to female circumcision. For some, this is a cultural tradition and it is argued that those outside the society in which the practice occurs have no right to challenge that tradition. The same argument is put up, and indeed was put up in Cairo, about the role of women, people saying that outsiders from the particular cultural tradition had no right to challenge it. This to me is a nonsense argument and, until some of these religious, ethical and cultural considerations are challenged, all the talk about population is meaningless.

         It can be said that abortion is a mistake and that, in an ideal world where there is proper education and information about family planning, it would not be resorted to. This is why I found it staggering that some people, including the Prime Minister of Pakistan, argued against sex education. It must be acknowledged that unsafe abortion and its consequences are a major public health concern which governments must address.

         Post-Cairo, there is widespread recognition that, to be successful, population programs need to integrate development and family planning objectives and to include strategies for addressing this social and economic disadvantage so often associated with high levels of population growth. I was very pleased to participate in what was known as `Parliamentarian's Day', which was held in the chamber of the National Assembly of Egypt. On this occasion, my friend and colleague the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) made what I thought was one of the best contributions of the day. In his speech, he highlighted the concern to achieve social justice for all humanity. He also stressed the universal basis of social justice. Without going into the complex philosophical argument, it can be summed up simply. All the main religions of the world, all the main moral philosophies and all the major traditions of democratic policies have one underlying premise: all human beings are of equal moral worth. The basic premise of equality is the foundation of the key religions of today's modern world, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Buddhism.

         In other areas, Australia meets standards at a national level but needs to continue to address the needs of particular groups, such as indigenous peoples, people in rural and remote areas and people from non-English speaking backgrounds. Australia needs to position itself early in ensuring that it meets, or more than meets, the objectives of the program of action. A detailed examination of the program of action has, therefore, been initiated and further statements on the results of these reviews are expected to be made early next year.

         Population is an issue for each of us. Perhaps because we as a country are not overpopulated, the issue does not generate as much debate in Australia or among Australian politicians as it should. If population in Australia is not a problem—although some suggest it already is—it certainly is for many of our near neighbours, for example PNG and countries such as Tuvalu and Kiribati. If reports are correct, global warming and the possible increase in sea level will cause a real problem for those countries. Countries such as the Cook Islands will not remain the paradises they are if the population issue is not dealt with.
