         —The Defence Cooperation Control Bill I am introducing today seeks to establish a very clear fundamental principle as a foundation for Australia's defence links with other nations. It seeks to reinforce the primacy of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as the basis for Australia's domestic and international policies and actions.

         Australia has a very proud record of achievement of human rights both at home and abroad. We are widely perceived as good `international citizens' who have consistently pursued peace, freedom, democracy and observance of human rights for the whole period of our nationhood. Australians hold these principles very dearly and tens of thousands of our men and women have sacrificed their lives during the 20th century so other people around the world could enjoy the same rights and freedoms that we do.

         The bill proposes that Australian defence forces should not engage in any cooperative arrangements with the armed forces of any nation which uses those forces as a deliberate instrument of state policy to deny basic human rights to its own people or people of another state.

         The definitions contained in the bill are very clear and concise.

         I do not believe that we as a nation should work with the armed forces of another nation when they are used to suppress the very rights of people which our defence forces are established to protect. This bill does not seek to interfere in the internal operations of another nation; it purely keeps us at arms length from its abusive power.

         The procedure to implement this principle is set out in the bill. A certificate would be issued by the Minister for Foreign Affairs giving a clearance to the Minister for Defence and the chief of the defence forces to participate in defence cooperation arrangements with a particular nation. This certificate would only be issued once the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, using its representatives in diplomatic posts in that nation, is satisfied that it is not a deliberate state policy to use its armed forces to suppress human rights.

         This certificate would be a disallowable instrument thereby allowing scrutiny of the process by the parliament. The certificate can be reviewed at any time that it appears the policies of that nation have changed and can be revoked. There is a clause in the bill which would ensure that the operation of this process would not interfere in our nation's capacity to contribute to UN peacekeeping or defence operations.

This bill is a reasonable, concise and principled proposal which deserves the support of the House.

       I am pleased to see the shadow minister for social security in the chamber because he raised aspects of this matter in a recent MPI. Poverty is alive and well in the sunshine state. As a Queenslander, that is something I say with not much pride. That is a statement of Peter Walsh, the director of the Queensland Council of Social Service and one of the principal authors of a recent report
       <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
        Drawing the line on poverty
       </emphasis>

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Over the last decade, Queensland has been the leading state in terms of economic growth, and industrial and business investment. However, not everyone has shared equally in that success. The report demonstrates that poverty and disadvantage are often hidden or marbled through the community. The report demonstrates that the social safety net is not working, despite the chest beating of the government and members opposite.

        The report highlights this government's failure to adequately address the public housing and health needs of even the most needy in our community. The report demonstrates the growing dependence of welfare agencies on emergency relief funding at a time when the federal government is actually cutting back on such assistance. Far from the rhetoric of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about helping the battlers, this report demonstrates that, in reality, the government has ignored the battlers.

         Drawing the line on poverty

        was conducted essentially in three parts: a breakdown of national socioeconomic statistics for Queensland based on ABS and 1991 census data; the 1994 survey of more than 300 church and community organisations throughout Queensland providing emergency assistance; and case studies of five diverse areas of Queensland where low income people relying on emergency relief were interviewed directly.

        The main statistical findings of this report have already been highlighted in the media and in this parliament by the shadow minister, as I said. For the purpose of this debate, I would like to give a quick reminder to all those opposite of some of the key facts. Eighteen per cent, or almost one fifth, of the Queensland population live in poverty. The Queensland poverty rate is two per cent greater than the national average.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        After housing costs are taken out, 350,000 Queenslanders are living below the poverty line. Of this, almost 137,000 are children living in families below the poverty line, which represents 26 per cent, or just over a quarter, of Queensland children. Elderly people have a before housing poverty rate of 27.2 per cent and 24.6 per cent, or almost a quarter, of young people under 25 years live in poverty. Two in three sole parents exist below the poverty line and the average weekly disposable income is lower in Queensland than in the other states.

        These are the statistics. They are very revealing statistics. They are statistics which Queenslanders can take no pride in. While some of those opposite might dismiss these figures as being somewhat dated, let us remember that this is the most current data available. While, like those members opposite, I wait to see the results of the 1996 census, I will be the first to applaud if they are better. But if the trend in poverty follows the trend in unemployment along the Queensland coast then it will not be a pretty picture. Even so, let us take a look at the two other components of the report which are based on surveys conducted just last year, 1994, of low income people who are living below the poverty line.

        Let us first look at emergency relief. The poverty research looks at who relies on—and why they do—emergency assistance to supplement their low incomes; that is, emergency relief provided by the Commonwealth and some states to church and community welfare organisations, like the Salvation Army, Lifeline, women's crisis centres, Aboriginal and Islander housing cooperatives, and so on. This is probably the most damning part of the poverty report. It demonstrates that the government's much heralded social wage or safety net is ineffectual for a great many battlers.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Declaring a single example of the failure of the government's social wage is a finding that, of 2,556 people surveyed between August and September 1994 who received emergency relief, 2,118 or 82.2 per cent of them received a government pension or benefit. I repeat: 82 per cent of people who received emergency aid in Queensland were already reliant on government benefit.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        I would also highlight the plight of the other 18 per cent who do not rely on government benefits and who are the real battlers in the community. The government's insensitivity to this group was highlighted just yesterday in this House with the passing of a budget measure that increases the safety net for pharmaceutical benefits from $400 to $600. You might recall that not so many years ago it was $312. That means that you have to be twice as sick as you were five years ago to get the safety net. That also means that those people who are on fixed incomes, many of whom are in that 18 per cent category, would be suffering from that measure and would possibly be cutting back on their medicinal requirements.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        I go back to the 82 per cent receiving government benefit. The biggest group demanding emergency assistance were the unemployed, making up 38 per cent of the total, followed by sole parents, making up 24 per cent. The survey also found that the majority of requests for emergency assistance were for basic living needs, including food, 23.1 per cent, and housing related costs, 23.8 per cent, which were cited as the two most common reasons. Requests for assistance for gas, electricity and water bills made up 22 per cent, with the biggest single reason for cash assistance coming from families with children. Medical expenses counted for seven per cent of requests, but again these mainly came from families with children—and that highlights the point I made earlier about the safety net.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The other revealing part of the poverty survey was the response of the welfare agency workers—those at the human coalface, if you like. Welfare workers regarded the severe shortage of public housing as one of the most critical issues impacting on the level of demand for emergency relief, in particular for young people and single parents.

        In June of this year, in the city of Gladstone, in my electorate, Ray Chapman of the Careforce community housing scheme had 60 people on his waiting list.

      </para>

        While I recognise that emergency relief is largely a bandaid measure, I find it extraordinary that the Commonwealth is slashing this funding while it is doing nothing to rectify the situation of thousands of desperate people who rely on these handouts to survive. Total funding under the Commonwealth emergency relief program has been halved in the last three years, from $30.2 million in 1992-93 to $14.8 million in 1995-96.

        This alone in my electorate of Hinkler has resulted in agencies having their funding cut from between 9.3 per cent and a massive 30 per cent. That is despite the fact that the Wide Bay-Burnett and Capricorn regions have the worst unemployment rates in Queensland and amongst the worst in the nation. In Wide Bay-Burnett, for instance, the unemployment rate is 13.6 per cent. In June this year, DEET figures revealed that the unemployed youth seeking full-time employment represented 41.5 per cent.

        The first thing we need to draw attention to is the fact that this is pretty rich coming from an opposition who, when they were last in government, saw the real value of pensions decrease by two per cent and the value of the social wage decrease by 17.5 per cent under the then Treasurer, who is now the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard).

        In relation to the poverty survey that was referred to by my colleague the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), the important issue that we do have to recognise is that the ABS figures, on which much of the data is based, are six years old. Since 1990, the Commonwealth government has substantially increased the real value of social security and pensions. For example, the income of a single pensioner renting privately has increased from six per cent to 13 per cent above the Henderson poverty line. The income of a sole parent who has two children and is renting privately has increased from nine per cent below to two per cent above the Henderson poverty line. The income of an unemployed couple who have one child and are renting privately has increased from 11 per cent below to one per cent above the Henderson poverty line. So there has been a substantial change in income support measures from the Commonwealth to the group that the member for Hinkler is concerned about.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The other issue that I think we do have to understand is the nature of the measure on which the report is based. The Henderson poverty line was designed in the 1960s by Ronald Henderson. It is an all or nothing measure, which nominates a point on the income scale below which people are understood to be in poverty. Since that time, disposable income has risen much faster than inflation, so an income on the poverty line in 1990-91 bought one-fifth more goods and services than 20 years ago.

        However, if you use the Henderson poverty line to measure poverty, you might assess that poverty has increased over the eighties by one-third. In using alternative measures, the poverty rate has in fact fallen by about seven per cent. I think this has been emphasised by the recent work done by Anne Harding at the University of Canberra's National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling. I want to quote from the excellent article by Deborah Hope in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Weekend Australian
        </emphasis>
        of 3-4 June, covering issues such as social inequality. Her article states:
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       According to Harding's estimate about 1.8 million Australians, including half a million children, are living below the poverty line—a tally significantly lower than the figure of 2.5 million of five years ago. Harding suggests one reason for this may be that social security payments have been improved in recent years to lift many welfare recipients on maximum benefits over the poverty threshold.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Indeed, I believe a number of our arrangements in the life and term of this government have contributed to the wellbeing of many families. One could point to the parenting allowance. All of these have been indexed. Indeed, yesterday the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) announced new increases in maternity allowance and pensions and the indexations from 20 September of this year so that single pensioners will receive $9.80 more per fortnight and each member of a pensioner or allowee couple will receive $8.20 more per fortnight. This means, for example, that the new parenting allowance, which was introduced only last month, will be increased by $8.20 to $280.20 per fortnight. The maternity allowance, which is equal to six weeks maximum parenting allowance, will be $840.60 when it is first paid next February.

        We have made a definite and determined contribution to make sure that pensions and benefits are indexed according to the cost of living, which is something the Fraser government never did and caused this decrease in income support. Additional family payment and basic family payment, which goes to the battlers as well as to the social security beneficiaries, is also a very important part of the social wage component. So there are a number of ways in which this government has made a huge and definite contribution.

        One of the important issues is the attack on unemployment in this term of government. It is obviously the greatest challenge to social inequality. It should be recorded that since March 1983 this Labor government has created two million jobs. Indeed, we came back into government in 1993 with a firm commitment from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to deal with issues such as long-term unemployment.

        It is a very proud record that over the last two years employment growth has been outstanding, with 670,000 more Australians in jobs compared with 1993 figures and, particularly, a drop in the number of long-term unemployed people by 21 per cent. So, if you look at a range of information, you will see that the picture is much better than is being suggested by a number of opposition spokespersons. One of the reasons for this is the value of the social wage and non-cash payments. I refer once again to Hope's article, because she was actually looking at whether there is an underclass in this country. Page 14 states:

       In relation to the housing issue in the Queensland poverty survey, it is important to recall that a great deal of the statistical data was collected just after the Goss Labor government had been installed. Effectively what you were looking at was a poverty situation that related very much to 30 years of neglect by the National Party government in Queensland. For example, the public housing stock is only 3.6 per cent of households. That is obviously a crucial test of poverty. Since 1988 the number of public dwellings in Queensland has increased by more than 60 per cent. So the Goss Labor government is moving to rectify that very low incidence of public housing, which of course is a major housing issue.

        The other issue that is important to look at is who is benefiting from the Department of Social Security initiatives and our job creation programs. If we look at the figures that relate to December last year, we see those in the youth category who register as being out of work—a category referred to by the member for Hinkler—receive support for about 10 months. Indeed, the more difficult group is the people who are aged 45 years and older. Only 10 per cent of young people in the 18- to 24-year category have been out of work for more than a year.

        While I recognise that the member for Hinkler's motion asks that the House specifically take note of this report and of poverty in Queensland, as a South Australian I am only too familiar with the fact that poverty is a national problem. As the situation in Queensland seems to indicate, the combination of federal and state Labor governments does not bode well for a state. South Australia has only recently emerged from the dark years of the Bannon Labor government. At the time that the Brown Liberal government took over office in South Australia our state debt was accelerating towards $9 billion. This debt is now being cut back, but the ultimate effect of Labor's economic mismanagement has been a level of poverty that we need not have had.

        As I have said, poverty is a national problem. A study released earlier this year by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra estimated that 1.8 million Australians are living in poverty. Of this number, nearly 1.2 million were members of families with children—a chilling reminder of the failure of Labor to honour its 1987 election promise that `by 1990 no Australian child will be living in poverty'. Australian society has been torn apart by the growth of poverty, as the gap between the rich and the poor grows wider. The sense of community, which has previously bound us together as a nation, must necessarily weaken.

        A recently released study by Professor Bob Gregory investigated the polarisation of wealth and poverty in Australia. The findings of this study are alarming. Twenty years ago the average income of people in the bottom five per cent of Australian neighbourhoods was 60 per cent of that of people in the top five per cent of neighbourhoods. By 1991, those at the bottom were earning less than 40 per cent of the income earned by Australia's wealthy. Over the same period average household income in the top five per cent of neighbourhoods rose by 23 per cent. In stark contrast, those in the poorer five per cent of neighbourhoods found themselves surviving on an average household income that fell by 23 per cent.

        Gregory found that employment levels between the neighbourhoods were also polarising. From the mid-1970s to 1991 the number of employed men as a proportion of the population dropped by 42 per cent in the bottom five per cent of neighbourhoods. This compares to a drop of 20 per cent in wealthier areas. This polarisation has been reinforced by trends in employment levels for women. In the 15 years prior to 1991, the level of employment among women living in the top half of Australian neighbourhoods increased by about 10 per cent. Over the same period it fell by a dramatic 40 per cent for women living in poorer areas.

       Statistics provided in this letter show that Lutheran Community Care saw 1,098 clients in 1993-94 and 1,037 clients in 1994-95. The crucial point to be recognised is that there was no decrease in demand for the services provided by this agency over the past two financial years. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth government has seen fit to cut funding to this agency by a massive 24 per cent. The rationale for this funding cut is that the unemployment rate has fallen. Such a rationale betrays a frightening lack of understanding about the entrenchment of poverty in Australia. Poverty is no longer confined to the unemployed, and this is the reason the demand for services provided by Lutheran Community Care has not decreased in line with falls in the level of unemployment.

They are recoveries in which the economic sun shines briefly and each time it does it  does so for an increasingly select few.

The honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) mentioned some of the studies by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, whose director is Professor Anne Harding. Professor Harding has, over many years, championed the thought that we should be looking at those matters that fall under the nomenclature of the social wage and adding those to any studies that are simply based on income levels. Her studies have shown that, if we take into account those measures that can be called social wage measures, the disparity between the rich and the poor has narrowed and that those social wage measures to a large extent are able to lift the disadvantaged above what might be defined as the poverty level.

Local government authorities are called upon to play a role in ensuring that the newer developing suburbs and communities take into account the needs of affordable housing. In my area, through funding under the building better cities program, we are using former institutional land at Janefield to try to develop an urban planning scheme that will acknowledge the needs of the different life-cycle points of the community and the need for affordable housing.

Areas of my electorate have been three years without a drop of rain—three years in which people have not been able to pasture their cattle. People have had to destock, and face huge interest rates. Yet the Queensland government's attitude is that, in spite of all this, there should be a user-pays basis for the value of the lease, increasing the cost of the lease—and there are also instructions that other conditions of the lease have to be fulfilled even though the country is in this condition.

More than that, all of their plantings currently occurring in South Australia occur only after a soil profile has been done. They determine which are the heavier soils and which are the lighter soils. Where the heavier soils exist a dripper with a different rate of water application will be applied relative to those vines of a different variety being planted in a lighter soil.

What has happened? The sales tax on the wine industry, which was at zero and was maintained at zero thanks to the effective work of the Fraser government and of my predecessor, the late Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles, under this government went to 10 per cent despite that promise. As if that was not enough, it then went to 20 per cent. And, as if that was not enough, under the 1993 budget statement it was proposed that it go to 32 per cent.

For an industry which can value add by ageing wine, it has never made sense to me that we say to a wine producer, `You have to pay tax on the imputed value of your wine production in the year of production.' It has never made sense to me that a country which is looking for exports and which has such magnificent value added potential with wine prohibits the ageing of wine with the use of the taxation regime by calling wine trading stock.

        Wine is not manufactured in the sense of pencils, pens or other materials; it is an agricultural product which will be of great value if it can be left to age. Because of that tax regime I have mentioned, Australian wine manufacturers have developed techniques which allow them to bring wine into production and sale much more quickly than with earlier methods where it was traditional to lay it down in a cellar to get that magnificent ageing process.

        Unfortunately, Australian wine manufacturers do not now put their good wines through a major ageing process because it is simply not cost effective and they are taxed out of the ability to do so, yet that is an area which I think any industry policy should examine and do things about. That would make the industry more attractive and more profitable and allow the industry to produce ageing wines which have a greater market value overseas. That is one area I have always been critical of, and I still hope one day to see some change in that.

        We are talking about an industry with a potential export growth increase of some $1.3 billion. We are talking about an industry where we can achieve approximately a five per cent share of the world's wine market by the year 2010. We are talking about an industry which is now seen throughout the world as a manufacturer of a very fine product. You can now travel to countries such as England and Europe and find Australian wines competing against the very best wines produced anywhere in the world—and it competes at a price. So it is a very competitive industry in a very competitive marketplace. It is essential that that competitive nature of the industry be maintained.

        As a politician, I have been a student of the wine industry for a number of years. I am familiar with a number of reports which have been brought down—a Victorian parliamentary report and a federal parliamentary report, which both touched on the lack of elasticity in the price of wine in the marketplace. In fact, it is quite clear that, economically, wine has a very low elasticity in price. In other words, if you increase the price of wine at the retail level, your sales will drop off. That lack of elasticity in the price of wine has been referred to in many reports and on many occasions. Of course, any tax adds to the price of the wine at the retail level. Obviously, with wine being so competitive, the margins are very fine and producers cannot afford to carry any increased taxes and have to pass them on to the consumer. That lack of elasticity immediately impacts on the sales of wines—and their sales drop.

        If we are going to be successful in overseas markets, then we have to encourage domestic production. The producer who is going to put some $10,000 per hectare in the planting of young vines has to carry those vines for up to five years before he is going to get any production growth out of it and any income return back. If our producers are going to become exporters, first of all, we have to ensure and encourage their domestic production and have a very healthy domestic market for them.

        Many people I know in the industry have started off as domestic producers and have now gone into exports. For example, the Delatite vineyard near Mansfield is one of the real cold climate producers in Australia whose rieslings and chardonnays are now widely sought after in London. It now has a major English exporting business out of the Delatite area at the base of Mount Buller. That is an unusual place to grow wine—believe me, in winter it is very cold—yet it produces some brilliant cold climate wines. There is a whole host of vineyards in my electorate that are similar. Mount St Helens, for example, in the Strathbogie Ranges is now a very large producer of cold climate chardonnay. Mount St Helens is a brand which is produced in Echuca, but the grapes are actually grown in the Strathbogie Ranges in Victoria.

I am sometimes astonished when people say they understand industry and are in a position of publicly involving themselves in industry direction and then come up with such quaint and nonsense arguments.

As the member for Wakefield said, it takes me back to 1983 when I was standing outside the Yoogali Club, in the seat of Riverina in the town of Griffith, and inside the former Prime Minister was saying, `Labor has pledged not to impose a sales tax or an excise tax on wine. The taxation disadvantages suffered by the wine makers with respect to stockholding will be objectively examined on the basis that wine making is a primary production process, not a manufacturing industry.' The reason the then Prime Minister was making this promise was that he knew how important the wine making industry was to the Riverina and to the wine making areas of Australia.

This commission has released a draft report, which shows that conflicting views are held among the three panel members of the committee of inquiry on the matter of an appropriate taxation regime for the wine industry. The worst cases were put by the chairman, Mr Scales, whose recommendations are that there be a 32 per cent wholesale sales tax and an additional tax, in common with the rest of the panel members—a specific tax of $4 per litre of alcohol. The combined effect of these two taxes, as proposed by Mr Scales, is equivalent to doubling the current sales tax on wine. We know that neither of these recommendations is acceptable.

         Sales tax is levied on products used for promotional purposes, including samples that are given away. This affects wine makers who use some of their product for tasting purposes and is particularly onerous for operators of small wineries who rely on cellar door sales.

A special exemption for cellar door wineries could be administratively complicated because of differences in the way cellar door tastings are conducted, for example, some wineries charge a tasting fee and others include tastings as part of a food and beverage package.(78) In addition, an exemption would be inequitable unless it applied to all samples given away for promotional purposes. The Committee concludes that the issue of sales tax on product `give aways' requires a fuller investigation and notes that, in respect of the wine industry, this issue is currently the subject of an inquiry chaired by the Chairman of the Industry Commission which will report by 30 June 1995.

It fails, in my view, to understand the nature of the wine industry. A two-tier taxation system in the wine industry, which is what has been suggested, would in my view be nothing short of a disaster. I think the appropriate response to this committee's draft recommendations is not only to leave best alone and not disturb the current tax arrangements but also to do something for the small producers like those in my electorate and the Swan Valley and to take up the cudgels of the banking committee and produce some exemptions from sales tax for tastings and give-aways by small producers.

All those bus loads of people who visit the Hunter on tourist excursions sip their wine and not all of them buy. The vignerons give away so much wine for which they receive absolutely no return.

        An increased tax on wine is really a punishment imposed on entrepreneurial success. Our wine industry has tremendous potential if crazy taxes do not kill off investment. Increased wine taxes certainly will kill off investment in an industry which, as other speakers have said, has the potential to earn huge export dollars and assist our trading problems. Kill the wine industry and what happens? First of all, we kill off employment. Areas like the Hunter, which for too long have been dependent on one industry—coal—have undergone a resurgence in living standards and opportunities because of the development of the wine industry and the development of the tourist industry.

        We can be sure of one thing: increased taxation on wine will destroy the tourist potential of the Hunter, will kill off wine production, will throw hundreds of people out of work and will devastate country areas like the Hunter and other parts of Australia. The people engaged in that industry are not glitzy socialites from major capital cities; they are men and women—Labor voters—who have managed to find employment in the wine industry. As I said, any attempt to impose increased taxation on the wine industry would be quite catastrophic.

       On Monday, 13 February 1978 at 12.40 a.m., a bomb exploded outside the Hilton Hotel in George Street, Sydney. The bomb had been placed in a rubbish bin which was being emptied into a Sydney City Council garbage truck compactor. The Hilton Hotel was the venue for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting which was to commence later that day. Twelve heads of government were staying at the hotel, including the then Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser.

One of the three, Timothy Anderson, was later convicted for the Hilton bombing, was again wrongfully imprisoned but acquitted in 1991 by the New South Wales Court of Appeal. Despite the gravity of this incident, which appeared at that time to be the first serious case of terrorism in Australia, there has never been a satisfactory investigation into the full circumstances of the bombing.

        There are many unanswered questions about the events of 13 February 1978. But it is worth noting that the bombing came at a time when there was much public criticism of our security forces, including serious questioning of the need for their existence. The Dunstan government in South Australia had abolished the South Australian Police special branch following the White inquiry, and other states were considering following suit.

        Following the Hilton bombing and the accompanying concern about international terrorism, ASIO received a 25 per cent increase in funding in the 1978 federal budget. That was when the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was Treasurer. It was his first budget—the same budget in which he took back the fistful of dollars promised at the 1977 election. ASIO was also granted substantially increased powers in the ASIO Act, passed in 1979.

        In June 1978 three members of the Ananda Marga sect—Timothy Anderson, Paul Alister and Ross Dunn—were arrested and charged with attempting to murder a right-wing extremist, Robert Cameron, with a bomb, which was alleged to be similar to the bomb used in the Hilton bombing. With the help of evidence from Richard Seary, who had infiltrated the Margas at the request of the New South Wales Police special branch, the three men were convicted and spent seven years in gaol.

        In 1982, 4 1/2 years after the Hilton bombing, a coronial inquest commenced. This inquest turned out to be a farce and proved totally inadequate. Far from solving the crime, it  failed to examine important evidence. Key witnesses were prevented from appearing, and crucial evidence was therefore suppressed. However, Richard Seary was again allowed to give evidence, which claimed that Dunn, Alister and Anderson had been responsible for the Hilton bombing. This led to a prima facie case being found against them, and the inquest was therefore terminated, amid uproar in the courtroom. However, no charges were laid.

        He does have the option of conducting a New South Wales inquiry, but this would clearly be of limited value as it is vital that all relevant federal agencies and subagencies participate fully and that witnesses under Commonwealth jurisdiction are able to be called to give evidence under oath and without any restrictions placed on them by secrecy provisions of any federal legislation, as outlined in part (5) of my motion. This is essential in order to get to the bottom of the matter, uncover the truth and force these agencies to be accountable for their activities.

However, for the reasons I have outlined, I do not believe this goes far enough. We need a full, open, joint federal-New South Wales inquiry with the powers of a royal commission.

        The Attorney-General also said that the federal Labor government would have no reason to be embarrassed by any revelations regarding the involvement of Commonwealth agencies in the bombing because the government of the day was, of course, the Fraser Liberal government. I can only agree with that. Indeed, one of the matters which could be examined is the role of Mr Fraser and his office in the security arrangements, as well as the Fraser government's attitude towards the abolition of special branches in the states, and the role of ASIO and other security services in the light of the South Australian White inquiry. I am advised that Mr Fraser himself took over responsibility for security at the Hilton Hotel shortly before the bomb blast on 13 February 1978.

        Having said that, I do not want to make this a partisan political issue. It is fair to point out that the resolution of the New South Wales parliament in 1991—under a state Liberal government—was unanimous, and that people such as Peter Collins, the then New South Wales Attorney-General and current opposition leader, have repeatedly, to their credit, supported the need for a joint inquiry. But there are many other questions the inquiry could investigate.

        Time is short, but the questions include: why were the army sniffer dogs, which were specially trained and prepared for the CHOGRM conference at the Hilton, mysteriously called off four days before the bombing? Despite official denials, this has been confirmed by ex Corporal Keith Burley, who was in charge of the army sniffer dog squad at the time.

        On the last point, there are also questions arising from the report of the now retired Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Mr Roger Holdich, which was tabled in this House on 28 June 1995. The report states on page 51 that Senator Gareth Evans provided Mr Holdich with the name of the Commonwealth scientist who approached him in 1980. Mr Holdich states that he found no evidence of ASIO involvement in the making of bombs in 1978 but the report fails to state whether or not Mr Holdich interviewed the scientist in question. Did Mr Holdich interview the scientist? If so, what was the result; if not, why not?

        The dog squad was told to prepare for a terrorist attack.

Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, has said that he is concerned about these matters, and the whole of the New South Wales parliament has passed a resolution calling for a full and independent Commonwealth-state investigation into these matters. They all think there is something wrong. Why doesn't the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth?

        Our job is not, here in this parliament, to specifically probe into the dark and murky labyrinth of the security forces.

It is so important that we do this because the people of this country are entitled to believe and to be confident that the forces of government, the security forces of this country, are working for them and not against them.

        Let me say most categorically that truth has nothing to fear from an inquiry. The government should have nothing to fear from an inquiry. ASIO should have nothing to fear from an inquiry. The police should have nothing to fear, the army should have nothing to fear from an inquiry, because truth has nothing to fear from an inquiry. This government should not be so concerned about the cost of an inquiry because truth is priceless; truth is precious. Any government which is prepared to spend $17 million investigating war crimes that happened in another country 50 years ago should certainly be prepared to help fund an inquiry of this nature.

        —I thought that this morning, with the motion of the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland), we might have heard something new that this government has not already considered. I come with some background of having looked at this matter extremely carefully and I must say that the recent decision by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) not to support a royal commission is something which, on all the evidence available to me, I support unequivocally.

        I think there are a few questions that should be answered this morning, and I want to go through them in a bit of detail. The first question is: why do people want an inquiry into the Hilton bombing? We heard one new one this morning, and that was from the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) who said that it was common knowledge that ASIO planted the bomb. That is his view. Other people want an inquiry because they think, similar to the view expressed by the honourable member for Warringah, that it was ASIO which conspired to plant the bomb, for reasons which were then dealt with earlier by the honourable member for Macarthur, because he pointed out, as other people have, that at the time the whole question of security agencies and the need for them was very much an issue in the public domain.

What conceivable reason would this government have? Why would I, as Attorney-General, the present Attorney-General or anybody else in this government be wanting to cover up something relating to the Hilton bombing?

        Reflect back to what happened. The actions that would be investigated by various inquiries, royal commissions or whatever would relate to the Fraser Liberal government, ASIO and the then Commonwealth police 20 years ago. To suggest that somehow or other their actions cause some embarrassment to the present Attorney-General, to me or to anyone else is ludicrous in the extreme. I have always taken the view that it would be no skin off my nose, or the nose of the present Attorney-General, if there were any convincing reasons to justify having a royal commission.

        The other interesting thing which I would like people to reflect on for a moment is what it would achieve. When you start with the view that ASIO was involved, because it was common knowledge, as was put by the previous speaker, is anyone going to believe what comes out of a royal commission? I know what would happen if there were a royal commission, whether it were run by New South Wales or whatever. People would not believe it, because people like the conspiracy theory: they wallow in it and they will go on believing it forever.

        It is also worth recalling that the activities of ASIO in relation to those events of February 1978 have, in one way or another, been subject to five different inquiries already—not to the wide extent that the speakers here this morning want, I concede. The first one was the New South Wales coronial inquest in 1982. The second one was the Hope Royal Commission into Australia's Security and Intelligence Agencies in 1984. The third one was the Woods inquiry into the conviction of the so-called `Yagoona Three' in 1984-85. The fourth one, the most recent inquiry to touch on ASIO's activities around the time of the bombing, was the report by the previous Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security into certain complaints against ASIO by Mr Richard Seary.

        During that inquiry, the Inspector-General examined ASIO's intelligence holdings relating to the Hilton bombing to the extent that they were relevant to Mr Seary's complaints. If he had found evidence of complicity by ASIO in the Hilton bombing he would surely have said so in his report, but he did not. On the contrary, he said, `ASIO received no clear warning that the Hilton bombing was going to occur,' and, `From what I have read and heard, the organisation was genuinely shocked at the bombing.' That appears at pages 27 and 58 of the report tabled by the Attorney-General in this parliament.

        It is this government's considered view after a lot of examination—I can assure those people who are interested in it this morning—that no information has been put before us which would justify a royal commission. Certainly, there has been nothing put before this parliament this morning. None of the evidence put before the government so far or that can be derived from available records indicates that any Commonwealth government agencies involved in the security arrangements for that meeting in February 1978 acted in a manner other than in the proper discharge of their functions and duties. That is the conclusion that we have come to after much investigation.

        I will make a couple of points on that. Under the division of responsibilities between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales agencies, the Commonwealth, through ASIO, provided threat assessments. As for physical security, when we talk about the question of the rubbish bin, for example, the New South Wales police had the responsibility for security outside the Hilton Hotel, including George Street. It was not the Commonwealth; it was a New South Wales Police responsibility.

        A number of people, including Mr Haviland this morning, in order to justify an inquiry, keep repeating as a fact the myth that ASIO conspired to plant a bomb in some deranged plot to force the Fraser government to recognise the importance of security agents and agencies and thereby increase their funding.

        When you look at it in this instance, you see that it was not some deranged plot by ASIO that caused that to happen. It was the 1979 act and budget which arose out of the recommendations of the Hope royal commission, which were submitted to the Fraser government in 1977. If you look at the speech of Mr Fraser to parliament on 25 October 1978, you see that he puts this beyond doubt. The then Liberal government accepted Mr Justice Hope's recommendations and intended to act on them. If the decision to revise the ASIO Act and to increase ASIO's resources predates the bombing, then what rational motive could there be for ASIO to plant the bomb for that reason? That issue had been disposed of before that date. So that is not something that hangs together in any rational way.

        Some might superficially ask: what is the point of trying to reopen a 17-year-old affair which has already been worked over by a major inquiry, several court cases, many reports and thousands of media reports? The fact is that the Hilton bombing is the worst act of political terrorism in this country's history. It was the largest security operation ever mounted in Australia, involving all key security agencies. It was also the most outrageous failure of security in Australian history, yet no-one responsible for the security operation has ever been held to account.

The sniffer dogs, carefully trained for weeks for the specific purpose of security at the Hilton, would have found the bomb instantly, yet they were prevented from going to the site just at the critical time.

Instead, we have had an endless succession of inquiries and millions of dollars of public money wasted, with no hope of finding the truth.

I am further concerned about this matter because, on the last day before the last election in 1993, a document dated 6 August 1992 in the name of D.N. Maynard of the Commonwealth Bank, purporting to be a report to the credit committee of the board, was the subject of a legal action by the Commonwealth Bank to prevent this document being published by Channel 10.

         Accounting standards are of particular importance in the corporations law when you look at what happened in the 1980s and the lack of material that was available. You could say the background accounting standards, which apply to corporations on related party transaction disclosure, were developed to meet a perceived inadequacy of information available in annual reports to shareholders of activities of directors with companies they controlled. It was felt that disclosure of information required by this accounting standard would prevent the recurrence of the excesses of the 1980s. Thus we have accounting standards AAS22 and AASB1017 concerning related party transactions.

         Last week we had a public hearing of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. In the course of that hearing Mr Cameron, from the Australian Securities Commission, and legal counsel appeared before that committee. I asked the legal counsel, Mr Durbridge, who had drafted the class order giving the exemption, whether or not it had been brought to his attention that there was indeed a connection between Mr Keating and the Commonwealth Bank.

         That document I referred to which had been subject to the injunction was in fact very much in the public domain. That document—the authenticity of which we know to be true because the Commonwealth Bank sought legal relief from it being published, and it was successful—shows one P. Keating to be a director-principal of the piggery group of companies. It also showed that there was a provision being made by the bank for the possibility of forgiving $4.5 million worth of the debt owed by that group of piggeries. This is contemporaneous with the Commonwealth Bank shutting down small farmers and small businesses. It is of concern that we have not had correct reporting on these matters.

         So I would go back to the guidelines of the Minister for Finance, which indeed require ministers to be accountable when they are acting other than in the capacity of their duty as a minister. I do not believe that Mr Keating's investment in the piggery group of companies had anything to do with his ministerial responsibilities. I found it of deep concern, as did Mr Durbridge, when he answered my question by saying that had he known about the connection he certainly would have been at least hesitant and would have looked far more stringently at the application for the class order granting relief.

         I want to raise the issue of the captioning of television in this country. They essentially show the soundtrack of television or video programs in a process whereby video captions are visible with an ordinary VCR showing the actual words in different colours so that people can distinguish the speakers. We had estimates in 1993 that as many as 999,800 people in this country have hearing loss or partial hearing loss—nearly one million people, according to the Bureau of Statistics, in 1993. So we are talking about a significant number of people.

But it is still not good enough that ABC television captions only 20 hours a week, and that is half of the national effort. The ABC endeavour is half of what we do nationally.

ITV in England currently captions 14 hours of news each week. In the United States and Canada more and more cable stations are providing captioning.

         There has been a degree of government action on the matter. The government's national conference in 1994 in Hobart carried a resolution which stated that Labor will fund services and programs that promote a competent and positive image of people with disabilities and ensure their lifestyles are as similar as possible to those of the general community where possible through a process of integration. Labor supports the provision of subtitling of news and current affairs on ABC and SBS television. So there was a commitment to do something about this issue.

         When it made the decision to maintain import controls on CDs in April this year, the government decided to continue to force Australian consumers to pay CD prices of up to $9 more than in overseas markets. It abandoned five years worth of efforts to tackle the overpriced music market and made a decision that ignored local consumers and only benefited the tiny handful of multinationals—EMI, Sony, BMG, Warners and Polygram—that dominate the recording industry.

         Back in 1990, the Prices Surveillance Authority found that international recording companies were slugging local consumers for CDs, compared with prices charged in the US and in Europe. Australian CD prices were consistently higher, sometimes up to 40 per cent. The PSA recommended that parallel importing be allowed as it would result in significantly reduced prices for consumers. As a result of this, the cabinet agreed in June 1992 to amend the Copyright Act to allow the parallel importation of new release sound recordings by foreign artists from five Western countries from 1 July 1994. Despite opposition from the industry, legislation to implement this move was introduced in December 1992 but it lapsed with the dissolution of the parliament before the 1993 election.

          The record companies claimed in their defence that they needed to charge high prices for imported CDs to finance the cost of publishing Australian performers. However, the PSA also found that companies did not appear to be spending significantly to develop local talent.

         The recording giants then argued that parallel importing would increase piracy. This is despite the fact that the biggest piracy problems they experience in Australia come from locally produced product. They tried to use intellectual property law before finally settling for the argument that the government's proposed package of reforms was contrary to GATT. This was then backed up by a submission from the Attorney-General's Department arguing that excluding Australian artists from parallel importation was in effect a protectionist measure unsustainable in the new world trading environment that had evolved since the 1992 decision was made.

        The Australian Consumers Association Chief Executive, Louise Sylvan, echoed this view at the same time when she said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government ought to be given a Grammy Award for its indecisive performance in this area of microeconomic reform. . . Having decided in 1992 to ensure a better deal for consumers by deregulating import provisions, the government is now set to go into reverse gear.

        Ms Sylvan told media representatives the background was `a product of the intense lobbying of the multinational record companies'. She said that Australian consumers deserve better than this from their own government.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . are so much cheaper in other countries and it's not fair that the current price disparity is maintained . . . the price disparity between Australia and overseas is pretty tough—there is a marked difference, a very generous gap.

        If I have quoted at length, it is only because there is simply no excuse for the way in which the government has acted on this matter.

If there is no longer any significant price difference, the existing arrangements obviously cannot be generating any significant subsidies for the development of local product.

         Past Australian consumption of recorded music has been low by international standards because of high costs. Simple laws of supply and demand suggest that, if CDs were more fairly priced, the recording industries would benefit as consumers would buy more product. This government's policy favours the music establishment and it penalises consumers. It especially hits young consumers—people with limited cash to spend, but the groups that would be crucial in breaking new acts—so, ultimately, this policy is self-defeating.

I believe that some banks have set out to drive lower income earners out of the banking system altogether.

         The banks claim that they are like other retailers. But what butcher, baker or supermarket would put a neon sign at the front of their shops flashing `low income earners not welcome'? And, for instance, if you were in a supermarket and decided to buy a jar of vegemite, you would not get the price jacked up just because you did not turn up with a trolley full of goods. The banks are clearly not behaving like other retailers with their fees and charges.

         Fortunately for the Australian public, the PSA exposed the banks' hysterical pseudo propaganda about the cost of running no-frills accounts. The PSA was unequivocal in rejecting the main plank of the banks' argument when it said, `There is no direct link between the cost of the account and the amount of money in the account.' The PSA went on to say that it was possible for the banks to provide satisfactory no-frills accounts and that already there are some bank accounts that come close to that objective.

         The PSA report places the onus fairly and squarely on banks to stop hiding behind the fake figures they have been presenting to the public. Probably no organisation in the banking industry has been more guilty of this approach, I say sadly, than the Commonwealth Bank. Some time ago the banks put about an argument that was really Alice in Wonderland stuff. They came up with the claim that the establishment of a basic banking product account would cost the banks and the community $1 billion a year. It was simply unbelievable and incredible. What were they proposing would come with the account? Champagne for every dollar handed across? Caviar? It was clearly nonsense and has been clearly exposed as nonsense by the PSA report.

         The fact is, Mr Murray, and all those other bankers out there, the argument has focused on the issues of margins, social responsibility and costs—and so it should. What does Mr Murray think we should be arguing about? The colour of the carpets in the banks? Really, what Mr Murray and many other bankers have been saying is that the banks are above scrutiny; that their figures should not be questioned.

         Indeed, Mr Murray went on to say that arguments about margins, costs and social responsibility were red herrings. Well, they are not. The banks have tendered their costings based on a system which pretends that the cost of each transaction is the same and that, because they make more money from larger accounts than smaller accounts, somehow the larger accounts are subsidising the smaller accounts. It takes very little time in a bank to see that the average pensioner's transaction takes only the fraction of the time of someone bringing in the weekend takings.

         The Commonwealth Bank has been particularly guilty of leading this propaganda charge and peddling a lot of misleading arguments. For example, the Commonwealth Bank claims that it gives exemptions from its fees and charges to pensioners. I thought that for a week or two myself, until I discovered that the Commonwealth Bank's exemptions do not apply to new pensioners.

         The problem is that the banks have set out to drive some of the less well off out of the banking system. What is to be done about it? Firstly, the public should not take out their frustrations on bank staff. They must address their concerns to management and the board. The policies of the board are not the responsibility of bank staff, who are doing their best to earn a living and provide for their families.

         Secondly, the government, in the light of the PSA report, must consider a range of options in its policy development. One option for serious consideration is to amend the code of banking practice to provide a guarantee of access to banking services for all customers. Industry based codes are one of the best ways of ensuring a fair and flexible market for services. An amendment to the code requiring banks to provide affordable financial transaction accounts and a guarantee that all consumers have the right of access to such accounts would be one course of action.

         If the ABA and other bankers are genuine, they would readily approach the government to begin discussions. Given the number of banks that have indicated privately to me and others, including the PSA, that they have no problems in bringing in a no-frills account, why will they not proceed forthwith? It would not be such a big step if they were to do what they say privately they are already doing.

         I also believe that the acceptance of a code which is committed to a basic banking product, among other things, might well become a condition of receiving a banking licence. As a community, perhaps we should consider public hearings for licence issue and/or renewal. Certainly, given the recent experience with the Commonwealth Bank, the code should provide for effective notification procedures for fee charges and changes.

         But, of course, the banks are not on their own. The opposition shares their view. The opposition thinks that the existing level of fees and charges is fine. Its philosophy on tax is that the lower your income the higher the amount of tax you pay, and the higher your income the lower the amount of tax you pay. Of course, that is the whole philosophy behind the existing structure of bank fees and charges. If the Australian people are looking to the opposition for action on this, then, as in so many other areas, they can forget it.

         Both the Mallee and Wimmera regions of my electorate are heavily dependent on the agriculture that surrounds them. In fact, agriculture is the very source of the local economy. When things are bad for agriculture, it flows right through the economic sector. It follows that small businesses in the service sector suffer equally cruelly when agriculture is on its knees. This means that there are many families in small businesses who are added to the already large number of farming families who are going without—the very same sort of people the member for Lilley was referring to in his remarks.

The second was because of a mouse plague in 1993-94 which ate the crop before it even had a chance to grow. These are the difficulties and challenges faced by people who work the land. The third was because of the record drought in 1994-95, which I am addressing.

The nearest formal statistics for Mallee I have relate to the 1991 census. They are bad enough, but things have deteriorated since. A staggering 23.2 per cent of families in Mallee have annual incomes of less than $16,000 per annum. The members in this House ought to consider how they could survive trying to educate their children through to tertiary education, paying for their expenses to attend schools in metropolitan centres, yet being denied access to Austudy because of their perceived wealth in assets while having incomes as low as $16,000 per annum and lower. It is not a very wealthy electorate in terms of total income. Only 7.7 per cent have family incomes in excess of $60,000 per annum. These are 1991 statistics, but I can assure you that anecdotal evidence suggests that things have deteriorated since then.

         It is with this background that I would have thought the government would have given a much more favourable consideration to Victoria's application for drought assistance.

Although the government did send out the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Nick Sherry, and I appreciated his visit, it was well after the event. Many of my people have asked me to ask the government and those who sit on the government benches: do you really care?

It is very interesting reading through this report. It seems inconceivable to me that the report would say that major droughts in Victoria in 1967-68 and in 1982-83, according to the current criteria to assess exceptional circumstances, would not be severe droughts.

In doing so, I have listened to the concerns of my constituents and conveyed to the ministers those concerns that my constituents are expressing.

The ensuing debate is now around the curfew and the concerns that people have that this is going to be a non-curfew airport, and therefore they are going to have jets going over at 2, 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning.

The coalition is going to do a complete environmental impact statement, other than the one that was already done in 1985 and which our government has already given a commitment to supplement, to make sure that no airport development takes place until all that supplementation investigation has been carried out.

         In the 1990 election campaign some literature was distributed in my electorate saying, `Don't vote for the Liberals because they'll sell the Commonwealth Bank.' In 1995 it is not the Liberals who are selling the Commonwealth Bank but those across the track—those from the Labor Party who said that they would never sell it. This was not as the result of a lengthy debate in caucus but rather a fait accompli at 6.45 on the night the budget was being delivered. After the budget documents had been printed, it was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to the Labor caucus.

The total taxation revenue in 1992-93, the last year before the 1993 election, was $89.435 billion, as shown on page 4.57 of this year's Budget Paper No. 1. In 1995-96, this financial year, the total taxation revenue has risen to $119.261 billion.

We recently completed this survey and had over 4,300 responses. A range of concerns was highlighted in those responses, particularly about the actions of the Kennett Liberal government.

One concern in particular was the issue of local government amalgamations, those reforms and particularly the removal of democratically elected councils and their replacements with unelected commissioners. The concerns relate to the inability to have a situation where people can contact representatives from their council to address the minor concerns, which are major to them, that relate to their local community.

         The Kennett government originally planned for elections to be held in those councils in March 1996. Subsequently, they changed that to March 1997. That was criticised by a number of commissioners. In fact, recently the chief commissioner of the city of Monash cited that as one of the reasons why he was retiring from his position early. He said that he just could not possibly stay in the job for that period.

         We have also heard the Premier comment on that issue again in regard to the city of Melbourne. He recently said that it could be five years before there was a democratically elected council in the city of Melbourne. This is a basic issue of democracy. It is an issue of concern to me and to many residents of Melbourne. What we are seeing is an attempt to abrogate the government's responsibility to be accountable—a situation where, on a continuing basis, unelected representatives of the people are acting on behalf of the government, often in a way which is seen to be detrimental to the needs of the local residents.

         I want to raise an issue involving ethnic communities in Victoria and their situation with the state government. Ethnic communities in Victoria are many and varied. They are small and large. They come from well over 100 countries. They are often tight-knit and they are often in need of government support. People from non-English speaking backgrounds often find it more difficult to access health services and education services and also find it more difficult to compete in the employment market.

         The Minister for Ethnic Affairs in the Victorian government is in fact the Premier. Over the last 2 1/2 years, in my travels around not only my electorate but most of metropolitan Melbourne, I have attended many functions of many and varied ethnic communities. I am yet to attend a function where the Minister for Ethnics Affairs from the state government has been present. There have been present on occasions a representative of the Premier, assorted backbenchers or a parliamentary secretary, but the minister himself has not appeared to be able to avail himself to those communities—that is, unless there is an issue that he sees is of some political significance.

         One issue that particularly comes to mind is that which involved the Greek community and the Macedonian community some time ago. The Premier was very vocal in support of the Greek community on that issue. Without going into the detail of that issue, I say this: a government that is led by a person who seeks to be divisive and to act to support one part of the community he represents versus another on an issue which essentially is not in the bailiwick of his government is really playing with fire. That has been the way the Premier, as ethnic affairs minister, has sought to act within the Victorian government. I think it is a very sorry state of affairs and it shows something about the way he sees people should play politics in a state: by being parochial and essentially trying to turn one part of the community against another.

         The situation as it now stands is that the government is going to go ahead with tolls. I, just as others have, sound a warning now to the Victorian government: tolls have been found throughout Australia to be an unpopular initiative, an initiative which the public in general have been shown to be averse to. A toll such as that proposed would involve something along the lines of a $3 one-way trip. Therefore, it would cost an average family which was travelling regularly along those roads to work and so forth something like $1,500 per annum, which is a significant cost to a family. It will affect large numbers of residents of Melbourne, in both the Tullamarine corridor and my own area through the south-eastern arterial. There are alternatives for the way this could have been done. This option will effectively be very adverse to ordinary working families within the Melbourne metropolitan area.

         On the question of taxation and charges, there has been a very major turnaround. In the early 1990s, the Liberal Party in this chamber and also in the Victorian opposition at that stage were always railing against the question of taxation and charges. Yet, with respect to the Kennett government, we have seen a $100 deficit levy allocated to each property in the state of Victoria. There is no equity in this measure. It is $100 for a one-bedroom flat in Broadmeadows. It is also $100 for a huge mansion in Toorak. It is not about equity; it is a taxation revenue measure.

        The government has developed a bold plan to provide Australians with higher retirement incomes and to boost national saving and investment. Compulsory superannuation is the cornerstone of the government's strategy. Since the late 1980s, employers have contributed for their employees under awards and the superannuation guarantee. As a result, over 90 per cent of Australian employees now have superannuation, up from less than 40 per cent a decade ago.

         The Treasurer (Mr Willis) announced a further boost to superannuation in the last budget. From 1997, many employees will begin making their own superannuation contributions paid from award wage rises. In addition, most workers making superannuation contributions will be able to claim a matching government payment in their tax returns. The result is that most workers will have the equivalent of 15 per cent of salary paid into superannuation by the year 2003.

         Despite what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) has just told us, the sad reality is that the greatest shortcoming for more than a decade in Labor's economic and social strategy has been Australia's chronic lack of national savings. This has been a major constraint on our economic growth, together with a failure to fully integrate our tax and social security systems with superannuation and savings policy.

         Incidentally, economic consultant Dr Vince FitzGerald, who was used by the government for an excellent report on national savings, said some two years ago that Australia's savings had fallen to its lowest level this century, excluding the Depression and both world wars. For most of the post-war period, national savings were around 23 per cent of GDP. By 1991-92, this figure had fallen to 16 per cent and has risen very slightly since then. Consequently, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will appreciate that, while the government is on the right track in terms of the need for superannuation policy, one has to question in detail whether the overall strategy will establish the parameters for the program which they want to implement.

         The week before last the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) launched a $12.5 million taxpayer-funded education program in an attempt to win widespread public support for the government's superannuation strategy. While there is general support—and the opposition accepts this—for the concept of superannuation, in principle, as a method for long-term saving, under Labor it is perfectly clear that consumer confidence in superannuation remains low. That is the reason we have this taxpayer funded program.

         Last November a study conducted by the Australian Consumers Council found that 50 per cent of those surveyed believed superannuation was a poor investment. In the same month the Australian Taxation Office released the first results of its survey into superannuation. The survey found that young people between 18 and 25 believe it is too early to be involved in superannuation; that those between 25 and 45 believe they have too many other financial commitments; and that those aged between 45 and 55 believe it is too late to start saving for retirement. So it is very much a case of `not in my backyard'.

         Several months later, ASSIRT investment research warned that confidence in superannuation could soon fall to crisis levels, with the results of its March 1995 survey showing a seven per cent fall in the number of people who believe that superannuation is a good investment. What were the reasons for this? Among others, respondents said that poor investment returns, lack of perceived tax benefits, the complexity of the superannuation system resulting from the numerous changes—some 2,000 that I have been able to identify—as well as tax law changes were largely to blame.

         Superannuation is also perceived as being too rigid as a personal savings vehicle as it locks up savings before retirement age and is not available as security for personal borrowings. In addition, contributors are frustrated by the lack of control over their funds, feeling that their financial destiny is entirely in the hands of the government and the finance industry.

        To give an example, someone on an average weekly earnings now—that's someone on about $32-33,000—when they retire, they will retire on a lump sum just under half a million dollars.

       <para>
        Such generous end benefits depend on critical assumptions not least of which are the age of contributors, the period for which they will be making those contributions, the level of contributions, whether they have been fully funded, whether they have been covered by adequate level of employment and so forth.

         Of course, Mr Keating's package assumes a steady rate of CPI growth of three per cent, wages growth of four per cent and a generous fund earnings rate of seven per cent. Any variation in those factors will mean that achieving a sum total of half a million dollars as a payout, as suggested by the Prime Minister, in real rather than nominal terms, will be exceedingly difficult. But unfortunately, as I said, resorting to hyperbole, he has given us the distinct impression that anybody even in the work force today, because of the government's SGC arrangements, will qualify for such a payout.

         In addition, according to the Treasury's own estimates, to achieve that sum a contributor would have to enter the work force in seven years time at the age of 25 when the government superannuation scheme is fully implemented, and work full time on average wages for at least 40 years beyond the year 2002. It is clear that today's workers cannot expect to have a part of, much less own, the Prime Minister's very heavily fertilised money tree, which has become the symbol of this entire program.

Sadly, that is not true. They are not guaranteed; they are not covered by the Banking Act. Superannuation law is quite separate from the banking law, and the benefits are not guaranteed by the Commonwealth.

         The fact is that if you dissect the community in terms of winners and losers on this exercise, you do not get the response that the Prime Minister would like us to see. Many women will be unlikely to receive a benefit anywhere near the amount touted by the Prime Minister, given that their average annual income is about half that of men and many women spend longer periods out of the work force. On average, women spend just 17 years in paid employment compared with 39 years for men, although it is clear that that is now in the process of changing.

         It is not just women. For example, under the compulsory superannuation scheme no worker in their late 40s who is on average weekly earnings could possibly accumulate sufficient superannuation savings to keep them when they are in retirement. Even someone aged 50 and earning $80,000 a year, which is well above the pension rate, would have to save at least 20 per cent of their salary to accumulate $490,000, in today's dollars, by age 65.

         Even Accord Mark VIII—this grand, shining emblem of industrial relations progress under Labor—shows that a worker on the lowest award rate, a worker who is receiving the Accord safety net pay increases, would in the year 1998 be $8.25 a week worse off in real terms by the end of the Accord while employees not covered by awards would simply miss out.

         Why is that?

If those people are not under awards then the big question is whether they are covered for superannuation, and it would appear that the answer is no. Consequently, for a growing proportion of the work force, Mr Keating's grand design of a $500,000 retirement benefit is as fanciful today as Mr Hawke's promise that after 1990 no Australian child would live in poverty.

         I should also make the point clearly here that, when the Treasurer (Mr Willis) spoke with me at a conference put on by ASFA last Thursday, he made the allegation that, under coalition policies, people would be considerably less well off in superannuation than they are under this proposal. I want to reiterate what was said on that day by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard); that is, no Australian worker will be `worse off' under coalition policy than they are under the current government's policy on superannuation.

         Let me refer to the question of industrial relations impact. No-one doubts that the SGC payments and employee superannuation contributions will have significant implications for the industrial relations system of this country. I have noted previously that low paid workers will be worse off. In an attempt to play down this apparently unforeseen effect of the Accord Mark VIII, Treasurer Willis has advanced the argument that superannuation contributions represent ordinary savings, which we all know is simply not correct. He says that these are savings that have been put aside. That is not an adequate explanation for the superannuation process.

         On 20 July last his colleague, the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns), effectively conceded this point when he said that compulsory contributions are a reallocation between present and future earnings. Consequently, low paid workers will actually receive less in the hand as a result of the Accord. He went on to say that the 1997 review of awards by the AIRC, which is conveniently timed to be in the same year as the introduction of this process, will ensure that no employee will be out of pocket as a result of superannuation contributions. If that is true, then the only conclusion that can be drawn is that employers will be paying more. We know that is precisely the reason why the mandatory element does not cover employees; it only covers employers.

         If the government compensates employees for their three per cent superannuation contributions by pay increases through the award system, surely it follows that there will be a premium for those workers who remain in the system and belong to a union. Clearly, there will be a disincentive to move to a more flexible, high wage, high productivity enterprise agreement system involving employers and employees.

         Consideration should therefore be given to the status of non-unionists in regard to the selection of trustees for industry funds where it is normally the prerogative of the employer organisations, the dominant union or the ACTU. But, in many cases, union membership is a minority interest. Therefore, while trustees are by law responsible for safeguarding the interests of all contributors, there is clearly a problem here when non-unionists, often in a majority, may not be adequately included in the process of selecting who their trustees should be.

         I want to refer now to some of the questions about savings strategy objectives. Clearly, our national savings strategy must have twin objectives: to reduce dependence on social security and the age pension—thus increasing public savings—and, at the same time, to encourage private savings. On that point, the government and the opposition are as one. But the attainment of these objectives must take into account their impact on the disposable income of individuals.

         At the same time as Australian workers face reduced disposable incomes because of a compulsory superannuation package, if the predictions about inflationary trends are correct they will also face rises in interest rates and home mortgages while real wages will remain virtually stagnant. In fact, a mortgage rate of 10.5 per cent today has the same impact as a rate of 16 per cent had on the take-home pay of workers in the late 1980s. Clearly, that is going to increase pressure for additional credit just to maintain standards of living.

         Government policy has also designated superannuation as a tax preferred investment over all other forms of saving: banks, building societies, credit unions and so forth. There is a clear danger in that. Much of the new savings which are now being compulsorily channelled into superannuation are, effectively, simply a switch between normal non-superannuation savings and superannuation savings. The latter are expected to increase to $2,408.5 billion dollars or 64 per cent of GDP by the year 2030 while, at the same time—and clearly as a result of that—bank and NBFI deposits are expected to fall. This will obviously have quite serious economic and social consequences, not to mention the realities of the problem of having a tilted playing field for investments on the one side and for drawing on savings on the other.

What they are not saying, of course, is that the hidden agenda is that ultimately the employer will have to pay the lot.

         In the meantime, however, there is a real risk that the level of income of low income workers is going to actually fall at a time when many of them need it most: the family formation period when they are paying off mortgages and so forth. It would be far more equitable if low and medium income earners were offered access to a flexible intermediate savings vehicle which would have some tax advantages linked to savings periods of, say, five to 10 years. That would give them the ability to save when they were able to save and, at the same time, to have access to at least part of those savings to meet those crisis issues of life which we all have to face.

         —Which also may not happen. Are we seriously going to believe this government is able to deliver on what is clearly a totally unfunded commitment? To date, five or six per cent of employer contributions have been left largely in the hands of industry fund trustees to invest through fund managers, and employees have felt divorced from the decision making process, which they tend to see as being the responsibility of the employer.

         But after 1997 employees will become well aware of their reduced take-home pay and, as a result, there will undoubtedly be an increased interest in the investment outcome of individual funds. Any adverse performance, such as we have seen in recent times, will no doubt bring with it a considerable consumer backlash, especially as we are talking about a compulsory system. The future for fund managers in that environment will be further complicated by the fact that by the year 2002 the federal government will have contributed at least $4.5 billion, according to the last budget, directly into superannuation. I am aware of no other area of fiscal responsibility where the government has ever injected so much taxpayer money back into the system as a means of supplementing savings.

         This means that by the next decade the level of direct government support to superannuation will be in the vicinity of $10 billion annually. How does that place it in relation to other major areas of expenditure? It is significant. For defence, $10.8 billion is projected for the 1998-99 financial year, and for education, $11.9 billion is projected over the same period. In other words, for the first time ever you are going to have this vast quantum, some $10 billion, going into superannuation, thereby competing in the public's mind with some of the very major areas of government expenditure.

And for that we are paying out $10 billion a year. That is the actuarial calculation which I urge the government to consider very seriously indeed: the cost-benefit relationship.

         So what will be the political impact? I think it is going to come in two directions. Firstly, there will be a growing number of parliamentarians who will start questioning whether the rate of return is justified. They will undoubtedly voice the concerns of their electorate. Secondly, the argument that the government should set rules for investment may become even more shrill. Almost every time you have a debate on superannuation in this chamber, members of the government stand up and say that superannuation money should be directed into national projects, into infrastructure investment, et cetera. The Treasurer then rushes around telling everybody, `No, no, it is not true. We are not going to interfere. It is entirely in the hands of the trustees and the fund managers. It is not the role of government.' The point I am making is that, as this quantum of money grows, the political imperative for governments to interfere in the process is obviously going to grow, and the evidence is quite clearly there in

         I believe that these twin pressures will make asset management even more hazardous than it is at present. We see that the portfolio theory for asset allocation takes account of historical trends in investment. However, increased political interest in the outcomes could well minimise the ability of managers to take the correct technical decisions. And we have seen how often that has happened in the past in other areas of government interference. Performance in the various categories for investment has varied historically. During the 1950s and the 1960s, we saw a decade and more which appeared to be an unending growth cycle. This may well happen again in the next decade. I do not know, you do not know; none of us does. But there is an equal risk that in the same period we may actually see an underperformance in economic terms or certainly in fiscal management terms.

         As the market for investment becomes more internationalised—and we now see vast sums of money passing hither and thither on a 24-hour basis—the attraction for Australian fund managers to look offshore for investment potential is obviously going to grow. After all, we are talking about two trillion dollars in the system—a vast amount of money. The question which has to be asked is: is the Australian economy going to be sufficiently broad and flexible enough to be able to absorb a large component of that money, or will the money have to go offshore as a means of guaranteeing the best possible return?

         There is unanimous agreement between both parties on the question of the need for increased domestic savings in Australia as an essential component for economic growth. A quantum jump in our standard of living cannot be achieved unless foreign debt is drastically eased through, among other things, a major increase in net domestic savings.

Increased domestic debt can only be justified provided the equity value in home prices continues to rise side by side with standards of living. But what do we see? The reality is that home equity values are actually falling and our standard of living is clearly stagnating.

Well, old age pensions are unfunded. That is not unusual in the public sector; it is not unusual at all. We know that next year they will be paid by next year's revenue.

         Superannuation is unquestionably one of this government's great success stories. I compared the situation that prevailed in 1983 and found that we are now heading towards a situation where up to about 90 per cent of wage and salary earners in Australia will be covered by superannuation, compared with 40 per cent of the rich, wealthy, high-income males who were covered in 1983. In that 90 per cent I am including the wage plug people in my electorate who, as you know, were excluded before 1983.

It is appalling. Why do I sit on this side of this chamber? Why is my commitment to the purposes of the Labor Party and the labour movement?

I question whether those 25-year-olds going into the work force on average weekly earnings would be prepared to take that risk.

         There are two essential elements in our approach to superannuation. The first element is retirement security. The government has also emphasised—as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker—that, in connection with retirement security, there are three essential components for us. We have guaranteed to maintain the age pension. That is the basic safety net. No-one, as far as we are concerned, falls through that. In addition to that, we have the compulsory savings element, which now consists of the superannuation guarantee and the minimum employee contribution. As well as that, we have the voluntary element of superannuation, which is encouraged by substantial tax concessions—still provided by government—and the government's matching payments.

If they are seeking from any political movement in Australia and from any government a firm, positive, honest commitment to security in their retirement, they will look to this government, to this party and to this movement and they will look nowhere else.

         The second element in our approach to superannuation is national savings, and reference has been made to the fact that Dr Vince FitzGerald, in his report in 1993, referred to the positive deficiency in the level of savings in Australia. Yes, there is a deficiency, and that deficiency in savings is critical in relation to financing the type of investment that we need to be undertaking in Australia. It is also critical to the current account deficit because, if people are not saving, they are buying; and, if they are buying, they are very often buying goods from overseas and that, of course, contributes towards the current account deficit. So we need to build national savings.

         What better way to do it than to build in the process of encouraging, assisting and enabling people to provide for their own retirement? Not only that, but we have said to them, `With those employee contributions that are being made, the government will match every dollar you put in.' As a result of that, by early in the next century, the equivalent of 15 per cent of people's income will be going in to provide for their retirement. Some people say it is nine per cent from employers, but that is not correct: six per cent will come from employers, another six per cent will come from employees, and the balance of three per cent will come from the government's matching commitment, making a total of 15 per cent.

         I said that some people had claimed that the employers would be contributing nine per cent, but they will be doing nothing of the kind. The first three per cent that came into existence in 1985 was a trade-off. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will remember that this government said to the ACTU and to the trade union movement, `As a result of productivity gains, employees—wage and salary earners—in Australia are entitled to a three per cent increase in their wages and salaries. Do you want that in your pocket to take home, or do you want us to arrange to put that three per cent into superannuation for you?' To their credit, the ACTU and the trade union movement said, `Put it into super.'

         The opposition and employers now claim that was the employers' three per cent. No, it was not. It has been suggested that with the progressive increase there will be a contribution from employers equal to six per cent. That will then match the six per cent from employees and the three per cent matching from government. To a very large extent, that is going to assist to overcome that deficiency in savings as a result of that. In fact, it is estimated that by the turn of the century it will have increased savings by two per cent of GDP. That will mean that, by the year 2006, each year savings will be three per cent of GDP greater than they would otherwise have been. By the year 2021 that will be four per cent of GDP. I think our GDP is about $450 billion. Translated into today's dollars, that means that we will have increased national savings by the year 2021 by an amount of $18 billion.

         —This bill amends the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Act 1991, the principal act, to make a minor amendment to the method of calculation of the late lodgment amount. A late lodgment amount can become payable under the principal act if a superannuation entity is late in lodging an annual return. The amendments to subsection 6(2) of the levy act will mean that a late lodgment amount will now arise for each calendar month which begins after the required return lodgment day and before the day on which the return is actually lodged. The late lodgment amount forms a component of the superannuation supervisory levy which all superannuation entities are required to pay to cover the cost of the prudential supervision of the industry.

         These amendments will ensure consistency with the method of calculating the late payment penalty under subsection 15DC(2) of the Superannuation Entities Taxation Act 1987. That subsection, incidentally, is proposed to be amended by the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) of 1995, which is due to be debated some time in the not too distant future. This amendment only applies in relation to returns lodged for the 1994-95 year of income or a later year of income. The changes are not, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) has explained, expected to have any overall impact on the revenue.

         The bill is essentially a housekeeping bill and it was introduced into the House on 28 June. This bill, although rather thin in terms of pages, does provide us with an opportunity to discuss matters relating to the mismanagement of superannuation policy under this government. I stated in speaking on one of the seemingly interminable bills in relation to superannuation earlier this year that a genuine retirement income strategy requires a stable and predictable environment, security, incentives to encourage financial independence, better integration of the tax and social security systems and the guarantee of a government safety net. Of these, Labor has most notably and totally failed to provide so far for a stable and predictable environment.

         A survey undertaken by Brian Sweeney and Associates earlier this year on behalf of the government tried to ascertain the level of support and understanding of the superannuation system. The result was not good for the government. Almost half of those surveyed had only slight or no understanding of superannuation. This was particularly the case amongst women, students and the unemployed. The proportion with a reasonable understanding had also fallen from just over 60 per cent to just over 50 per cent since the last survey was conducted in 1992. So they are going backwards. Most misunderstandings resulted from the constant changes to the rules in government policies, the language used, taxation issues and how superannuation worked as a system for retirement income. Interestingly, 40 per cent thought they were getting poor returns for their money and over 70 per cent of respondents wanted more control over how super funds invested their money.

        That is it in a comparative nutshell. How correct are her observations. But the real reason for Labor's super sell at the moment is the coming election. There should be no doubt about that. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is desperate to sell his superannuation initiative. He has been constantly talking up the impact of the superannuation changes on the supposed average worker, who earns $33,000 per annum and will receive a pay-out of $462,000. What goes unsaid in this exercise is that the example so fondly given by the Prime Minister only applies to someone who is 18 years of age today, begins full-time employment in the year 2002 and retires in 2042.

These figures show that the first baby boomers who retire under the SGC will still be poor enough to receive the age pension at retirement age—unless, of course, they buy additional superannuation. In the same terms, those who retire in the next 20 or 30 years will still have to rely on a pension, if only a part pension. The fact remains that even for the average person entering the labour market in 2002 superannuation will not deliver the promised retirement incomes. Take the simple fact that 70 per cent of workers earn less than the $33,000 average income per annum. They are therefore not going to receive the almost half a million dollars figure being touted by the Prime Minister.

         Dr Vince FitzGerald has also been critical of the Prime Minister's focus on the $462,000 figure. The Prime Minister's assumption also neglects some realities inherent in our labour markets. Australia's work patterns are constantly changing. Workers do not stay in the same job their entire lives, nor do they necessarily stay in the same industries. Many—too many, some would say—suffer periods of redundancy and unemployment. In fact, something like eight per cent of the work force is currently unemployed.

         The days of starting a job with John Smith and Co. Ltd and working there until you retire are long gone. The Prime Minister's example is a throwback to the work patterns of 30 years ago, or even the age of the FJ Holden. He is living in the past. It explains why the government has been unable to adequately resolve the problems associated with portability.

          Women, on the whole, will not benefit from compulsory superannuation charges to the same extent as men. Women continue to have broken work patterns due to their taking time out of the work force to bear and to raise children. They are also more concentrated in part-time, casual and temporary work. Treasury has estimated that a woman with a broken work pattern, or someone on less than average wages, could receive as little as $50,000 in retirement from the superannuation guarantee charge system.

         That is not the only example of the government's exaggeration of the benefits of superannuation, as it now is. The Prime Minister has been travelling around the nation, telling all who will listen that the SGC will eventually result in an accumulation of $2 trillion in superannuation funds—up from $40 billion a decade ago and $180 billion this year. Dr FitzGerald had this to say about that:

In light of the survey findings I referred to earlier, it is perhaps not surprising that the government is now going to spend $12.5 million on an advertising campaign to educate Australians on how the system works. This campaign is, however, a complete waste of taxpayers' money. The superannuation system has several major problems which need to be fixed before any major campaign begins. Unfortunately, that campaign has already begun.

These public servants want to roll over their superannuation to their own funds, yet they will be penalised 1.75 per cent for every year before the age of 55. A 30-year-old will therefore be penalised with the loss of 44 per cent of his or her accumulated superannuation. That is a disgrace.

Portability without prohibitive costs should be available to all people who need to—and, indeed, are virtually required to under the law—roll over superannuation. We have a ridiculous situation where many superannuation accounts are currently incurring taxes and charges in excess of earnings. I am sure we all have had examples of that coming into our offices. There is the superannuation contribution tax, the statutorily required charges, plus administrative costs. With all the taxes and charges being levied on super accounts, it is little wonder that people are becoming disillusioned in superannuation.

         It is ironic that the government taxes superannuation contributions at 15 per cent—off the top—yet is going to match employee contributions, at some time in the future, by up to three per cent. We heard the Treasurer saying that it really does not matter that we tax government employees, that we impose the fringe benefits tax on them, because it is really robbing Paul to pay Paul. Here we have it. But there is still a little bit of a margin in it, because the government is creaming off 15 per cent and is going to give three per cent of that back at some time in the distant future—perhaps.

         In a compulsory superannuation system, choice is a necessity. This choice should not only relate to the actual fund but also to the type of fund—that is, whether investments in capital guaranteed securities, in equities, or in a combination of the two, can be made. Consumers having the right to choose the fund that best suits their needs will increase the level of competition and help reduce management charges. To some degree, the industry funds have already assisted in this. However, the superannuation industry needs to be thrown open to other financial institutions such as banks and credit unions.

Since coming to office in 1983, this Labor government has radically transformed retirement savings through the creation of comprehensive national superannuation schemes. In the long term, that will increase retirement incomes and national savings. Clearly, if you provide for your own retirement through superannuation, it will improve your lifestyle.

         Prior to 1983, when those opposite were in government, superannuation was the preserve of managers, some public sector workers and some white-collar workers in the private sector. I always wondered why it was never extended to the rest of the work force—obviously, there were real motives for that. The vast majority of Australian workers did not have access to superannuation to supplement their retirement incomes. This government, in pursuit of a fair and equitable retirement income policy for all Australians, has to a large extent remedied that situation through a number of key policy initiatives. It is important to have key policy initiatives. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), can think about that.

         The 1985 accord with the ACTU played a pivotal role in the superannuation process, with a universal three per cent employer provided superannuation benefit in lieu of an equivalent productivity based general wage rise. We need to remind people that the workers themselves contributed that three per cent in 1985. The award based superannuation system, which emanated from the subsequent national wage case in 1986, saw access to superannuation extended from a base of 39 per cent of employees in 1983 to 72 per cent by July 1991.

         —When it comes to the trade union movement, I suppose the opposition has one policy—to be in complete opposition with the trade union movement no matter what they do instead of being a little cooperative with them. Getting back to the main subject of superannuation: to supplement the development of award superannuation, the government in the 1991 budget introduced the superannuation guarantee to further extend the coverage of superannuation for employees and to ensure compliance amongst employers in meeting their superannuation obligations to their employees. That is extremely important as well.

         The combination of award superannuation and the superannuation guarantee had increased coverage to more than 90 per cent of the Australian work force as of August 1995. Once again, that is another tremendous record that Australians can be proud of. By the year 2002, under the superannuation guarantee schedule of rates, workers will receive employer superannuation support equivalent to nine per cent of their salary.

         I remind honourable members opposite that when they last held office at the federal level, only 39 per cent of the work force was covered by superannuation. Now we are talking about taking that figure up to 90 per cent. I think you will all agree that this is a damning indictment of the opposition's retirement income policy at that time. They did have a policy at that time, albeit a very bad one. But, clearly, it did not require the powers of Nostradamus to see the potential of superannuation in the future direction of retirement income policy in Australia. It needed to be addressed a long time ago.

         The federal government's hard work in the area of superannuation has ensured that a whole new generation of Australians has access to a superannuation base which will go a long way to ensuring financial independence when they enter retirement. That financial independence is important for a good retirement income policy. However, ensuring access to superannuation is only half the issue. The government has also legislated to ensure that superannuation funds, in which workers have invested their hard earned money, are investing their funds in a prudentially sound manner. Of course, that comes to the safety aspect of superannuation funds and that is important as well as far as the employees are concerned.

         In the 1995-96 budget two specific initiatives were announced in terms of the superannuation component of the government's retirement incomes policy. From 1997, variations to awards will see the introduction of employee contributions to superannuation paid out of future wage rises. Contributions amounting to three per cent of average weekly ordinary time earnings will be phased in over three years. This phasing-in period will reduce undue pressure on wages and costs and should see no discernible reduction in disposable income.

         To complement the three per cent phased employer superannuation contributions, the government will match dollar for dollar employee contributions with direct payments to workers' superannuation accounts by paying the second round of the One Nation tax cuts in this form. The matching payments will be capped at three per cent of the average weekly ordinary time earnings and a means test will gradually withdraw support up to a salary in a range of up to $65,000 per annum.

         By the year 2000, it is estimated that the government will be paying around $4.5 billion per year into the superannuation accounts of workers. This matching government contribution is specifically targeted at low and middle income earners who have traditionally included a significant proportion of women. Indeed, prior to 1983, only 24 per cent of workers covered by superannuation were women. Government policies have seen that figure continue to rise dramatically to a point where 85 per cent are now covered by superannuation—still short, of course, of the national average.

         The means testing of individual income instead of family income in terms of the government's superannuation contribution will provide many working women with a further incentive to save in their own right. This initiative builds upon previous government policy initiatives to extend superannuation coverage to women, which have included superannuation contributions being fully vested and preserved so the accumulated benefits will not be lost if a woman leaves her job for any reason; the relaxation of occupational linkage requirements, which allows women and men to pay superannuation contributions up to two years after stopping work or seven years where they are on leave for the purpose of raising a family; and a reduction in the number of hours which must be worked in any week from 20 to 10 hours before workers are eligible to contribute to superannuation.

Indeed, during the first few decades of the next century, the majority of workers—that is, those with incomes below average weekly earnings—will progressively move to a situation where their retirement income will be no less than their pre-retirement income when the age pension is combined with the income stream derived from superannuation benefits.

The opposition's reliance upon tax concessions to encourage people to provide for their own retirement has not worked in the past in Australia, or anywhere else in the world.

Employers, always eager to reduce costs and increase profits, will no doubt take advantage of deregulated labour market conditions proposed by those opposite to stop paying superannuation contributions on behalf of their employees.

In this context, it is imperative that we build our own national savings pool from which the private sector can source investment capital which will drive economic growth in the long term.

         However, I go back to the notion that somehow the market is failing to deliver finance to small enterprises which would, in turn, create the exports that we so dearly need to repair our awful trade balance. I say that is a ridiculous notion because, since the 1970s, for example, many of the policies of governments, especially governments of the Labor variety, have rendered Australian small enterprises as vastly less attractive investments than their alternatives, being those that are listed on the stock exchange or in the bond market—and certainly less attractive these days than investments you will find in our region but outside of Australia. New Zealand is a good example; the reforms which have taken place there have rendered investment in a small enterprise far more attractive than those in Australia.

There is nothing to stop him going in to see a broker in Anchorage and making a decision, after studying the investment environment, and doing exactly that.

         One thing they missed was that earlier this year in May the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters (Mr Johns) embarrassingly let slip that there would be large numbers of Australian public servants jobless as a result of the last federal budget. I seem to recall that the figure was something like 4,000.

This is the sort of thing that is happening all over the state of Victoria because of the policies of Jeffrey Kennett. We will see not only the SEC being privatised.

Mary started her campaign for the freedom of the bears in 1993. Since then she has collected over 65,000 signatures on petitions protesting the farming of the bears for the extraction of bile by the Chinese.

In old Mogo town near Batemans Bay there is a bar which is called the `Fred and Ron and Jim bar'. It was set up by Ron Prior of old Mogo town.

        `Yes, definitely,' said her mother. Yet the Liberal Party says that Carmen Lawrence was responsible for her death. And little goody-two-shoes over there was in there encouraging them all the way through. Let me quote Mrs Campbell again. She said:

        Now I think that he—

         The Liberal Party have made the implicit connection in the royal commission and the explicit connection in the parliament that the petition was the sole cause of Penny Easton's death and that the Minister for Human Services and Health was the cause of the petition and the cause of her death. They have absolutely no basis for that outrageous vilification of her. This has not been tested in a coroner's inquiry. It has not been tested in a court. And, as a consequence, we find in this Mrs Campbell saying:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I just want this royal commission to get to the truth of how one of my daughters eventually came to commit suicide because she felt she had been set up so well there was no way out but that.

        But then Commissioner Marks said to Mr Easton:

        I think you must understand that it is not my task to investigate the suicide of your former wife and you have got to realise that this witness cannot be expected to answer questions about her state of mind in a particular time.

         The mother is right. Carmen Lawrence is on trial for the suicide of Penny Easton. That is how it has been reported. That is how the Liberal Party have done it.

         , it was Richard Court who first raised these Family Court matters in the Legislative Assembly. There are absolutely pages of text. Let me give you a quote:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Last week I said that Exim had sold its investment in this business to friends and relatives of senior management of Exim and at the same time had lent them money.
       </para>
       <para>
        You know that the petition that Brian Easton had presented was about whether he had $200,000 coming to him outside of the Federal Court proceedings. That was what it was about. Yet here we are—with Richard Court raising this thing in the Legislative Assembly. Then you have Mr Cash, a member of the Liberal Party, who said in 1987:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Is the Premier aware that in answer to a question asked in parliament he said that Mr Brian Easton had severed his financial connection with the company Eastmark at the time he was managing director of WA Exim Corporation? Can the Premier explain the fact that Mr Easton is presently being sued in his capacity as a guarantor of Eastmark's loan to the value of $182,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, this is one side of the marriage trying to get some material in the parliament to talk about the money he was receiving. When, of course, the other side of the marriage gets into it with the Easton petition, it is a great crime. But it is all right for the  Liberal Party to introduce this stuff. Then Mr Lightfoot, another Liberal, said this:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Is the Premier aware that the two passports of Brian Easton, the commissioner of the Western Australian Public Service Board, have been confiscated by the Federal Court? Has Mr Easton submitted his resignation to the board? If yes, on what date? Is Mr Easton to receive an ex gratia severance payment exceeding normal public service regulated payments?

        The then Premier, Mr Burke, said:

       <para>
        It was all right for the Liberal Party to raise it then, to raise all about the income of Mr Easton and to have the then Labor Premier say, `Hang on, I think there is a marital problem here,' But that did not stop them. We then had Mr Dowding coming in on behalf of the government saying:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I have been fully informed. I think it would be fair to say that the public will be watching the opposition very carefully to see whether it supports the member for Murchison-Eyre's misuse of his parliamentary position in yet again asking a question of the type he asked last night. The first thing the House should know about the question is that it breached section 121 of the Family Law Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, here you are, the Liberal Party, running the stuff on this settlement into parliament, breaching the Family Law Act, and you go onto it even after Dowding has rebuked you. Then Mr Lightfoot comes in with other matters:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

       <para>

       <para font-size="-=2">
        submitted his resignation? What payments will he receive? Where will they be drawn from?
       </para>
       <para>
        Then you've got Mr Masters, another Liberal:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Which former employees of WADC have received a payment?
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Speaker, after all this the Speaker of the Western Australian parliament has this to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I refer members to certain questions without notice being asked by the member for Murchison-Eyre. The point that does concern me is whether the privilege of the freedom of the House might be used to circumvent an explicit order of a court or written law of this country. Obviously, it makes a mockery of observing a sub judice convention if the House tolerates or encourages speeches or questions aimed at subverting an order or rule given in an appropriate court. Likewise, this parliament should not permit its privileges to be used to circumvent the written law of the Commonwealth aimed at protecting the personal privacy of citizens.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, Mr Speaker, here is the Liberal Party over an extended period of time, raising all of the other side of the ledger in the dispute in the marriage of Penny Easton to Brian Easton. Here is the Speaker of the parliament rebuking them; the Premier suggesting that there are marital problems; Mr Dowding saying they should desist. They keep it up and keep it up and, finally, when one petition they think they can link to Carmen Lawrence suits their purposes, they narrow the terms of reference to focus on that and exonerate Court and his whole grubby bunch in this exercise.

        Mr Speaker, what we have seen in all of this is that the Liberal Party was in it up to its neck and that any honest terms of reference in Western Australia would have extended to these matters. Because if there is no established connection—and there is not—between the petition presented on behalf of Mr Easton and Penny Easton's death, the proceedings before the royal commission are irrelevant to the manner of her death and therefore are politically irrelevant.

On that we find Mr Richard Court's again convenient inconsistency. He says in the submission on the same subject that the secrecy of cabinet proceedings is fundamental to underpinning the doctrines of cabinet solidarity and collective responsibility under which all ministers, irrespective of their individual views, are required to support cabinet decisions outside of the cabinet room, particularly in parliament.

That is why the kangaroo court has no place in Australian politics, no place in Australian civil life. But what has a place here is morality and decency.

         That is, in essence, what the Prime Minister is saying.

It doesn't matter what Carmen Lawrence said or did. It does not matter what Keith Wilson or Pam Beggs said or did. None of those things are of any relevance.

         What the government has done over the last couple of months is set about to deliberately devalue the notion that ministers ought to tell the truth. That is what they have tried to do. Do you know why they are trying to do that? They are trying to do that because they are preparing the way to repudiate the findings of the royal commission if those findings are politically uncomfortable for Carmen Lawrence.

         The Australian public—through all of the bluster and through all of those sitting in dumb silence on the back bench of the Labor Party while their own leader was speaking—has to understand that you are, lemming-like, being led over the cliff towards a situation where, if this royal commission brings down an adverse finding against Carmen Lawrence, your leader and deputy leader are going to get up and repudiate the recommendations of the royal commission. They are already paving the way.

         The way you pave the way for that repudiation is to devalue the notion that it is important that ministers tell the truth in public life.

He said, `It is always open to the government to get hold of the recommendations of the royal commission and say, "Thanks fellas. That's it. See you later. Back to business."'

It doesn't matter, because it does not involve any dereliction of her duty as Minister for Human Services and Health.' The fact that she actually lied and the fact that she engaged in a cover-up—the fact that she may have been guilty of the watergate crime of cover-up—are not really going to matter. That, basically, is what the government is setting out to do.

That was their own royal commission that they knocked over.

         This censure motion deals with a proposition put forward by the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) and the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) which was repeated outside the House today by the shadow minister for health, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), and that is their allegation that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) is responsible for the suicide of Penny Easton. It was put plainly, simply and clearly, as the Prime Minister pointed out. John Howard is making an art form of slip-sliding away from these particular propositions when they are put.

Firstly, this morning when invited to detail the substance of the so-called repudiation of his conversation with the member for Chisholm, he said, `Of course, this is not a connection which we would seek to make. We are concerned about higher things.' When invited to detail his conversation, the discipline he imposed upon him, he said, `No, I don't wish to comment on that. I might be around talking about the absolute truth, but if anyone wants to know the truth of my comments to the member for Chisholm in that regard it is not a truth I care to share with you.'

         —It was a quiet wave, a subtle little tut-tut. The Leader of the Opposition is used to dealing with Western Australian members in that manner. How well we know that. Fundamentally, this royal commission stems from a number of things. Firstly, it stems from revenge: a desire by Richard Court to damage his predecessor. Secondly, it is a product of a desire by the Western Australian Liberal government to cover up massive internal problems in the Liberal Party in Western Australia. What was John Howard's response to those massive internal problems? Decisive leadership? Stepping in and ensuring that an outcome was there for the benefit, in particular, of his loyal supporters who are now independent liberal candidates? No. It was a quiet look across the scenery, a quiet shake of the finger, a little tut-tut.

This epitome of honesty in politics was trying to convey over here in the press gallery that what he was doing was subtly and informally—though his hands were terribly tied, closely bound—letting it be known that he would like a little bit of change in the Liberal Party in Western Australia. What John Howard did on that occasion was walk into Western Australia and support the other side.

There is no term of reference in this royal commission which suggests that it will get to the bottom in any way, or even attempt to get to the bottom, of Penny Easton's suicide. This has to be the ultimate in cynicism: to use the fact that, because it has been a matter of such public comment and controversy over the years, there is a concern about the circumstances of the death of Penny Easton, to link that up with a political attack upon the minister for health, and then to arrive at no conclusions. `Let it out there in the ether, let it run, but let's have no conclusions on it'—that is the objective of the Liberal Party.

         The problem for the Leader of the Opposition is that, instead of maintaining discipline, three of his frontbenchers have in the last 24 hours exposed the intention—exposed what they want the public to believe as opposed to what they have been prepared to say. When John Howard first started commenting on these things, he said, `I'm not going to comment on any evidence. I'm going to say nothing about the royal commission.'

In the absence of a coronial inquiry, a term of reference for a royal commissioner is required to establish that, but there is nothing there because they do not want it investigated. What  they simply want is a cowardly attack on the minister and then, for their own purposes, a linkage in the public mind that they hope will be explicit in the public mind but only implicit in theirs as far as they are concerned.

         So what do you get from that royal commission? They say that the government has no right to, first, defend its minister in public and, second, regard this royal commission as, by its terms of reference, an involvement questioning important institutional issues which go to the heart of the operation of politics in this country—that is, parliamentary privilege and cabinet confidentiality.

This was the day when the strategy was to be laid down about how they would go to the next election. What does he find when he goes down there to the press club? He finds that the press, like the people of Australia, want to know about the character of this Prime Minister. They want to know whether they can trust him to enforce standards.

And we go back to the tried and true, `Oh, it's all a conspiracy by the Liberal Party.' What a pathetic defence! The other tactic that this government always engages in is that it always accuses its opponent of its own crime. If you've got the money and someone has seen you put it in your pocket, it is the other bloke who took it. You had to laugh when the Prime Minister got up and said that the opposition had been elevating untruth into an art form.

This is about whether or not you can believe the word of a minister, because if you cannot believe the word of Dr Carmen Lawrence on a thing like this you cannot believe it on anything. If you cannot believe her word on factual circumstances that she was personally involved in, the fact is that she cannot retain the confidence of this House.

         The other thing that I find amazing is this repeated—as if by repeating a falsehood you somehow make it true—claim that what we are looking at are events that happened years ago. Let me tell you where this all comes from. It comes from a statement that Dr Lawrence made to the Western Australian parliament on 10 November 1992, a day after the Easton suicide. She was asked, `Did you know about it prior to the petition being tabled?' She said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Just a minute, member for Kingsley. After discussions with the petitioner and on the advice of the Clerk of the Legislative Council, Hon. John Halden adopted the appropriate processes and tabled the petition at a time of his choosing. I was informed that he was to do that and I learned the detail of the petition and its general thrust upon its tabling. That is the way it is and that is the way I have explained it. That is the position.

        The critical question here is: can you trust a statement that Dr Lawrence makes in a parliament? It was not just in the Western Australian parliament. She went back to the National Press Club and she stuck to the story. There is no room here for her to start sliding off her story. There is no room for her to say, `Well, perhaps I did raise it in the cabinet' or `Perhaps it was discussed in the cabinet.' The one thing she was always firm about was that she had learned the detail upon the tabling, that there had been no prior engagement by her, discussion by her or motivation by her in relation to this petition. She said at the National Press Club:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Yes, I want to be very clear about that. I was told, to the best of my recollection, the night before that Mr Halden would brief me on the petition the next morning. The next morning the focus of it, as I said, was very clear on the embarrassment it may cause to Court. My knowledge of the involvement of the Eastons and Family Court details of it occurred at the same time as it was tabled or after I read it after it was tabled and there was interest in the matter. I was not aware of it until it was tabled.

        That was the statement that she made at the National Press Club. That was the statement she made to the Australian people.

That is the very heart of the question as to whether this minister is capable, in a sticky situation, of telling the truth.

        He said it a second time. But just in case anyone missed the point, in case anybody was half asleep that early in the morning and could question the motivation of this member and this opposition, he said it a third time. On the third occasion, in the same interview, he said:

        So don't buy this story that it was all in the heat of the debate, that it just came out, that it was not premeditated, that it had nothing to do with the Leader of the Opposition, that he did not know what they were going to say in advance and that when he heard about it he went out into the public domain and repudiated it. Where is his statement repudiating the member for Chisholm's television appearance on 18 April? Where is his statement repudiating the tactic that the member adopted on that occasion? There is nothing but deafening silence from the Leader of the Opposition.

        Here is Dr Wooldridge, who one could reasonably say is not prone to rushes of blood to the head. He is our mild mannered, considered and reasoned good doctor of the House. He has been leading this charge not just since yesterday but for months. For months he has been attempting to destroy Dr Lawrence by linking her directly to Penny Easton's suicide and saying that her actions led to the suicide.

         The fact that there was a bit of repudiation yesterday from the Leader of the Opposition does nothing to wash his hands of the fact that he sat there silently when this campaign was building momentum and when the preconditions of this royal commission were being set in stream. So that was Dr Wooldridge yesterday. Then we had the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) saying her infamous words:

I have sat on the front bench for some time listening to this debate—it has certainly been for the last couple of months and it might even have been for a longer period—and hearing Mr Tuckey's chants and mutterings about blood on hands. Every time the minister got up in this chamber to answer a question, we would hear the member for O'Connor parroting, `Tell us about Penny Easton's suicide?' and what have you.

        He was dead right on that: it certainly had political overtones. In other interviews, he made it perfectly clear that the whole purpose of this royal commission was political and that the royal commission would be damned before it started because of its obvious political overtones. Of course, the Deputy Premier of Western Australia was dead right.

Can anyone in this House—and some of the members here have seen their share of royal commissions and have seen them pass by over the years—remember a royal commission that was not conducted in at least one of those areas of criminality, of illegality, of corruption or at least some area of public policy? Of course you cannot because this royal commission is completely unprecedented in Australian political history. It does no credit to parliament and to governments across this country that political standards have apparently slipped so low that this royal commission can be started by the Western Australian government.

The terms of reference do not go to the question of the suicide. In April Dr Wooldridge was out there setting the scene, which was reinforced by the members yesterday that we associate in the public's mind the death, this tragic event, with Dr Lawrence: get that into the ether, get that into people's minds.

The terms of reference given to me by the Western Australian government don't even go to that point.' The terms of reference, oddly enough, strangely enough, only go to about one small portion of the entire events. They certainly do not go to the involvement of Premier Court in relation to his actions in the parliament. They apparently do not go to the actions of other Liberal Party ministers in the parliament when they were then in opposition. They go to none of these matters at all.

It is no surprise at all because it is what it is. There is not a person in this country who does not think that if Carmen Lawrence had left politics, was teaching philosophy at some university, was anywhere but sitting on the front bench of the federal government there would be any royal commission.

We can now turn to the reality, the real motive behind this censure motion, which is basically a distraction for a government because they are on the political back foot. The reason they are on the political back foot is that a senior minister in this government, one touted at one stage to be Deputy Prime Minister, said one thing in her state parliament a few years ago and has since been demonstrated to have not been telling the truth. It is as simple as that. I thought the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) made a very nice analogy when he said that the truth for the Labor Party was like yellowcake—something to be avoided at all costs.

It just amazes me that people come to me, such as the bloke who rang me up this morning about a particular matter. He had heard Mr Keating say something, and he rang to tell me that it was not the truth. It was as if I should issue a press release to say that Mr Keating does not tell the truth.

He said that they had a meeting—

He is the Leader of the Labor Party in Western Australia, and he said on radio, after the royal commissioner had said that these matters would be the subject of questioning in the royal commission, `We then had a meeting and it was obvious that we would have to give our evidence to the royal commission about what happened in the cabinet meeting.' What he relayed to the Australian people was that they basically made a decision.

So you do get a rather interesting choice: either the whole of the Labor Party in Western Australia is lying or the previous Premier of Western Australia, the current minister, is lying.

        Quite frankly, Minister Beazley, as the senior Western Australian, the fact is that that is not right, that is not true, and we have the evidence in the royal commission. This whole censure motion is just a political put-up job. I thought it was because the Prime Minister had had such a bad day at the press club. But I came to another conclusion: he obviously was not expecting to answer any questions today, because he could not answer any of the questions at the press club.

         The fact is that, as we rise today, there are a lot of questions still to be answered. The basic reality is that this minister has not told the truth. One thing ought to happen now in accordance with precedent. Mick Young did it with the Paddington Bear affair: he stood aside when there was an investigation. You guys cannot make up your minds whether or not you are going to take any notice of the commission. The censure motion ought to be rejected.

        —Today in the debate on the censure motion the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made a number of allegations. There is one in particular on which I claim to have been misrepresented. He said that John Howard had suggested that I point out that Carmen Lawrence had killed Penny Easton. This morning at a doorstop interview my specific comments were: `I don't think you could say that Carmen Lawrence killed Penny Easton.' It is completely the opposite of what the Prime Minister said. For the record, I do not say, and have not said, that Carmen Lawrence caused Penny Easton's death.

         —Before I was rudely interrupted by that storm of falsehood and malice, I was making some remarks about the dangerous notion of directed investment, concerning a falsity doing the rounds of the financial media regarding the possible use of superannuation funds to fund venture capital, developmental capital or infrastructure projects.

         The point I was trying to make was that this notion of market failure being attributed to fund managers was quite false and that fund managers should be left to do their job according to the covenants contained in section 52 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, which is the parent act of the legislation which we are seeking to amend today. I expect that debate to continue for some months. I will do my best to participate in the debate in the media, to quash this notion that in some way a government's advice or direction to a superannuation fund manager is inherently superior to the judgments that that fund manager might make according to the quality of investment opportunities presented to him or her.

         Generally speaking, the impression among the electors with whom I have discussed superannuation is that it is too complicated. The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in his remarks earlier today made the same point—that it is very difficult to imagine public enthusiasm, which is perhaps even more important than public confidence, in superannuation, and it is very difficult to see public enthusiasm growing in an environment where things are just too complicated to possibly understand.

         I recall with some dismay the remarks of Dr FitzGerald when he addressed a conference sponsored by the Australian Superannuation Funds Association in June this year at the Hyatt Hotel in Canberra. He described the superannuation regime as resembling a Sony music machine: it looked very slick and very attractive on the outside, but inside it was fiendishly complicated and, therefore, any investigation as to what was going on inside the machine should simply be left to experts.

         If it is permitted for legislatures and governments to create a regime for superannuation that is so ferociously complicated that the ordinary citizens, whose funds are the subject of these laws, are not even permitted implicitly to investigate and understand it for themselves, then where are we ever going to generate the enthusiasm that is required beyond what exists now? One glance or one small exposure to the nomenclature of superannuation, with terms such as `transferable RBLs' and so forth, makes it quite plain that, so long as we fail in our efforts to somehow simplify this system and make it a bit more user friendly—to use a popular term these days—the notion of thrift will really not take hold with as much success as it is necessary to achieve.

         Supervision of superannuation, as it is conducted in this country, is plainly a requirement of generating that needed public confidence. Just as the member for Curtin, who is in the chair now, has described some of the woes that his constituents have brought to him, I can say that I have experienced exactly the same thing in my short time as the member for Wentworth. Two weeks ago, a lady came in to see me. A resident of Perth, she had made the decision to move to Sydney—laudable though that is—but had left behind in a Perth superannuation fund some $80,000.

         After working for a short time in Sydney, she consulted a financial intermediary who advised her that the best thing she could do was to roll over the money and transfer it to a fund in New South Wales, where she could have much closer access to the fund managers who were investing it for her. She signed a rollover authority, giving that financial intermediary authority to direct the fund in Western Australia to transfer the money via a bank—the Commonwealth Bank, as a matter of fact—to a fund in New South Wales, in Sydney.

         Somehow or other—and this is not clear—the intermediary used that authority to persuade an officer of the bank in Perth to transfer that money via telegraphic transfer to his own bank account, giving the impression that he was acting as her agent and that he had her authority. Sadly, he misappropriated those funds to satisfy his own personal debts.

        Shortly thereafter, he was detected and charged with a variety of fraudulent acts and, of course, a bankruptcy petition was lodged against him. Westpac, which was his bank, appropriated the money in his account to satisfy outstanding debts that he had with it. Result? Dr R's money vanished.

         She went to the ISC, the commissioner, whose budget apparently we are dealing with today. If this late lodgment levy we are talking about is some sort of user-pays scheme for approved funds to fund the cost of supervision, then we are talking about the commissioner's role in the scheme of superannuation. I wonder whether you can guess what the answer was from the commissioner? `No, it is a bank problem. It is not a super problem. It was the bank that transferred the money from itself in Perth to another bank in New South Wales. I am sorry. It is not a superannuation problem. Go and see the bank ombudsman.'

         In that respect it is as well to recall the trouble that occurred in the bond markets last year. I have had a few people come into my office with documents saying that they had invested in a capital stable fund. What does that mean to the ordinary person in the street? It means that the principal stays at what it was when you invested it and that you accrue interest as time passes—nothing too risky. Well, that was hardly the case last year when, as I said earlier, the bond market looked like a Quentin Tarantino movie, with blood everywhere.

         People who went long in bonds in early 1994, on the basis that they were a safe investment, finished the year behind where they started. There were some, of course, who were not so imprudent and did not act with such recklessness. They have been the subject of critical remarks I have made in this place—in particular, the officers of the Reserve Bank who sit on the investment committee of their in-house superannuation fund and who somehow managed to reduce their bond weighting to zero early last year; not, I am glad to acknowledge, in absolute anticipation of the bank raising interest rates, but through some bizarre and, for them, extremely lucky coincidence. But that is not the only example of peculiar management of superannuation funds. There are many others, and that is for me to deal with at another time.

I thought it would be an interesting exercise to test this proposition before the floor of the House. A letter has been written to me by a 14-year-old. I would like to read the letter in full. It shows an attitude on the part of one of our young people. It says:

        I am a student in year 9 at Mirani State High School. In Social Science we have been studying Parliament and we know it's a two way street. So I would like to share my concerns on youth homelessness with you.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        You and I have been fortunate enough to have a good life and people who care about us but many youth are homeless because they have been sexually or physically abused or their parents don't want them. It isn't always their fault. Most are not old enough to vote so these people need people to voice their needs. Many of them have appalling living conditions and not enough warm clothes or nutrition, so they have poor health. Homeless youth have very grim employment prospects as most leave school at 15 and as a result have very few job skills. Because they haven't got the security of a job or support from caring families they are left wide open to exploitation. They need money to survive so many turn to prostitution or other crimes; such as breaking and entering and mugging. But perhaps the biggest problems are drug abuse, youth who don't want to be helped and the public's attitude to this issue.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I think it is up to the whole of Australia to do something about this problem. The first step to reducing this problem is to change the public's attitude; this could be achieved by Education Programmes so they learn just what homeless people go through. Homeless youth don't just need a house, money and food although refuges, halfway houses, benefits and charity organisations are really helpful. Refuges and halfway houses are just places to sleep for a short time. But what these kids really need is a home. Somewhere where they are safe, are wanted, somewhere where they are loved and where they belong. The benefits the government give out are helpful but they are not enough. Another way to help homeless youth stand on their own two feet is to help them find employment. Special training programmes could be set up to help those who want help. This would help them to get a job, gain self-confidence and find a new direction in life. Although all this would cost a lot of money if this problem could be halved then other problems such as crime would be reduced as well and that would be one less serious problem for Australia to find an answer for. Because I believe that all people deserve a fair go in life.

         I will give some facts and figures. The recent report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs estimated that 22,000 Australians under the age of 18 are homeless. That is bigger than a fair sized town in my electorate. The national youth housing strategy discussion paper released in March said that there were 162,000 people aged 15 to 24 living below the poverty line.

Life Education is another program that goes without the benefit of government support, by way of a tax deduction.

         —I rise to support the international campaign to ban landmines. The Australian Land Mines Network is planning a national day of awareness on 28 August to heighten awareness of the landmines crisis. Over 80 organisations will be participating in this national day of action. In Sydney, prominent Australians such as Gabi Hollows, Justice Marcus Einfeld and representatives of bodies of the Catholic Church will urge the Australian government to support the ban on the use, trade, production and stockpiling of anti-personnel mines.

         There are over 100 million landmines laid in more than 60 countries, killing over 10,000 civilians each year. According to UNICEF, between 30 to 40 per cent of landmine victims are children. While the United Nations and countries including Austria, Belgium, Cambodia and Sweden have thrown their weight behind this global ban, Australia maintains that landmines are a legitimate weapon in terms of defensive warfare. I would argue that we do not make these weapons in this country. We do not have a use for them, not since the Vietnam war. I would argue that we strongly support the ban.

         While the Australian government has provided assistance for mine clearance operation, it only supports a ban on landmines that do not have a self-destruct or self-neutralisation capacity. There are arguments that landmines are a military necessity. The long-term human and socioeconomic costs far outweigh any short-term military utility. Chemical weapons have been said by some to be useful in times of war also, but their impact on human beings has been so devastating that they have been banned. Landmines must also go into that category because they are uncontrollable and they are an indiscriminate sort of weapon whose eventual target cannot be determined by the military and is more likely to be a civilian.

         The truth is that self-destruct and self-neutralising mines are not reliable. It is difficult to obtain an accurate figure of their failure rate. Certainly, a meeting of experts called the International Committee of the Red Cross suggests at least 10 per cent is a realistic failure rate. That failure rate means that any area mined with smart mines will have to be cleared just as carefully as an area covered with conventional mines.

         Many of the poorer countries in the developing world will oppose a ban on anti-personnel mines unless smart mines, at least, are included.

         In terms of recent international moves, Belgium has enacted legislation for a total ban on the production of stockpiling transfer and the use of anti-personnel landmines; such legislation is to be reviewed within five years. A moratorium on export of anti-personnel mines is to be placed in 15 states including Canada, France, Great Britain, South Africa and the United States of America. Italy has a moratorium on production in Italian territory. The United States Senate has voted for an amendment which would place a moratorium on the use and deployment of landmines after a three-year period for the US army to test and deploy alternative tactics and weapons.

More African states will attend a review conference and 13 countries have indicated their support for the total ban. Certainly what needs to be done is a twofold approach—that is, the clearing of mines in place at present and a commitment of funds to the research and the development of mine clearance technology and a total ban on the production, use, transfer, export, sale and stockpiling of anti-personnel landmines.

        I urge all Australians to support the efforts of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines to achieve a total ban of their production, sale, marketing, export and use on this National Day of Action. Landmines pose one of the most serious risks to the safety and well-being of millions of people around the world. At present some 100 million landmines are in place and another 100 million mines lie in stockpiles ready for use. Children are particularly vulnerable because of their natural curiosity. Landmines come in a bewildering array of shapes and colours. The sheer number of them in some countries leads children to regard them as harmless, every day objects. The cruelty of these weapons and their growing cost in human and economic terms is a catastrophe. They must be banned entirely and as soon as possible.

         I have called on Landcorp, which is a state government instrumentality which has responsibility for construction of these types of facilities in that area, particularly in the city of Joondalup, to look at the construction of a 50-metre swimming facility at the Arena complex in Joondalup. That is a new sporting complex, of which I imagine there are not many in the country, but unfortunately lacks a 50-metre swimming facility for young people. The northern suburbs is in dire need of olympian standard swimming pools to ensure that the emerging crop of athletes can reach their potential.

         While there are a number of small recreational facilities, like the Craigie Leisure Centre, these are unsuitable for the full development of the potential of the local young swimmers.

Many of these youngsters who may miss out are potential champions of the future.

         Landcorp, which has reaped great dividends from its activities in the northern suburbs—in particular, through the sale of the Joondalup Country Club, from which it reaped a benefit of $20 million—should use some of this windfall money to provide facilities for local young swimmers. With the large numbers of children participating in local swimming programs, the provision of a 50-metre pool in Wanneroo or Joondalup would be one way that Landcorp could give back something worth while and lasting to the community which so strongly has supported it.

         —On 15 November last year I raised in the House, in the context of debate on the Racial Hatred Bill 1994, my concerns about an incident that had occurred at a company in Brisbane involving some Spanish speaking workers, originating in particular from El Salvador. Those workers were on strike as a result of discriminatory behaviour that had occurred at their workplace, Steel-Line Doors, and as a number of them had been subjected to violence, intimidation, harassment and injury, with all of those incidents being racially based. On that previous occasion, I outlined to the House my concern about this incident and the fact that it was a poor situation to have occurred in Australia—as it is in contrast to the normally very good race relations which occur in this country.

         I am pleased to be able to outline to the House that after many months there has been a settlement to this dispute and, in fact, the workers' position has been vindicated in that settlement. A few days ago, in early August, the management of Steel-Line Doors reached an agreement with the workers and their legal representatives, through the Anti-Discrimination Tribunal, in a hearing in front of the President of the Queensland Anti-Discrimination Tribunal, Ms R. Atkinson. This resolution and settlement has totally and completely vindicated the workers position on this matter—and I am pleased that that has occurred.

         It has been a very long period for these workers. They have been on strike and, therefore, without income for some eight or nine months. They have all had many struggles. They escaped their homeland and come to this country as refugee immigrants. In doing so, all personal resources, all personal belongings which had been accumulated over the years had to be left behind. They were living in rental accommodation and had suffered greatly from their experiences in their former homeland—and it was an enormous tragedy that these workers also had to suffer such racial discrimination after having arrived in this country.

         Thankfully, the justice system in this country has vindicated their position, and they have received a settlement which is in their favour. In fact, their settlement is the largest settlement to have been arrived at against a company or corporation in Queensland by the Anti-Discrimination Commission. The settlement involves the company making a payment to the workers of the sum of $85,000, such sum to be distributed amongst the complainants as they choose.

Also, the company management is required to publish an apology to the workers for the upset and hurt that they have suffered as a result of the practices that were engaged in by the management and other workers of that company.

         The Australian Commandos never secured a prisoner, though they tried to get one once or twice, and they never succeeded in preventing the Japanese from doing anything that they really wanted to do.

         They were one of three small forces which between them immobilised two Japanese divisions. At sea, the American submarines were operating from Fremantle against Japanese shipping with increasing success, and in the air the squadrons of the American and Australian Air Forces were operating from airfields in the Northern Territory with increasing strength. These activities, with those of the Australian Commandos in Timor, convinced the Japanese High Command that a counter offensive from Australia was in preparation. Accordingly they sent their 48th division to Timor to reinforce the existing garrison; this was an experienced division of fifteen thousand men which had served in China, the Philippines, and Java. The same anxiety later caused them to send their 5th Division, which had fought in Malaya, to the Ambon and western New Guinea area, and to form from these divisions a new army with headquarters on Ceram Island. These three small, valiant efforts on the land, the sea, and in the air, immobilised over thirty thousand Japanese troops, at what was possibly the worst time in the war for the Allies.

         Bernard Callinan served Australia in many other ways, so numerous that there would be too many to list in the time available to me tonight. He was President of the Royal Humane Society.

        With respect to the question of the Victorian situation, it is just ridiculous. Over 40,000 people from the Victorian public sector have been put out of work over the last two years. I am sure they are wondering about what the Premier means with respect to their contribution—I suppose the contribution of taking a package, if they were lucky, or otherwise going onto the dole queues and looking for work. With the fact that there have been numerous federal public servants poached by the Victorian government, he obviously does not see all of them as being no good. And this is after a decade of reform in which the Public Service federally has played a major role in a range of government initiatives in ensuring that those initiatives were implemented properly and with the best interest of the country.

         I was listening to Canberra radio talkback this morning and there were a number of public servants who rang in mostly to complain about Kennett's comments. Public servants in Victoria could not do that. If they were Victorian public servants and they were identified, they would be endangering their employment because they are not allowed to comment publicly at all. I have had public servants from the Victorian Public Service raise issues with me about state government changes with respect to education and health. But the fact is that they cannot go public on that and they are scared to go public because they know what the reaction will be. Some of them have been hauled in and asked to explain their actions. In those circumstances, it is quite ridiculous for the Premier to say, `We are working in a consultative manner, in a manner which encourages our Public Service.'

         The link between the opposition's policies federally and the position of the Victorian Premier is also worth commenting on. Mr Kennett in a recent interview was asked, `Have you discussed this in detail with John Howard?' Mr Kennett replied, `No, not in detail; but we've had discussions in the past. We've had discussions this morning.' Yesterday a number of points were made by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) and other ministers on this issue. I know that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has subsequently said no. I quote again from that article:

        That is interesting. A number of times in this place and elsewhere we have had situations where the opposition has stated that there will be major cutbacks in federal government expenditure. The fact is that that is almost always going to relate to people's jobs, and it is going to be public servants' jobs.

         In those circumstances there has to be job losses and the public servants who—again, I quote Mr Howard—have nothing to fear from an incoming Howard coalition government are facing unemployment. I think the circumstances here need to be addressed. Where are those cuts going to be? What will be the situation with respect to job losses in the federal Public Service under a Howard-led government. I think the member for Canberra ought to address that. Jobs will be gone in Canberra, jobs will be gone in Melbourne, in Sydney—right throughout Australia. And which services that we provide will be hit? Social security? Employment, education and training? Community services? Which areas?

         It is fine for the opposition to state there is nothing to fear, but it is about time they came down with some detail about what they are going to do. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) has said there will be cutbacks in the Working Nation program. What will those cutbacks be? How many jobs will go in that process? What will be the result? What will be the result for public servants, who have nothing to fear from a coalition government? These are the questions the opposition has to answer in this place and in public forums, rather than hiding behind `there is nothing to fear'.

         The rough transcript I have of what the Prime Minister said today says, `Is it like John Howard, who had the member for Barker ask a question on Hindmarsh bridge he knew to be a complete untruth? He went in and asked the question, setting up the minister for Aboriginal affairs, saying he had disseminated information when the member for Barker was the disseminator of the information himself—and the Leader of the Opposition condoned it.' The Prime Minister then went on to say, `The Liberal Party had raised untruthfulness in this parliament to an art form over the years.' Later on he referred to what John Howard knew about it and whether he encouraged the member for Barker to put the question which he knew was predicated on a lie and an untruth.

         I make the point that my question to the minister for Aboriginal affairs back in March mentioned some secret attachments to a report—the Fergie report. It mentioned secret attachments, secret letters. It mentioned photocopies of those secret letters. On no occasion did it mention anything other than those secret attachments, which are now the subject of a royal commission in South Australia. Nobody has ever—until today, until the Prime Minister did here—accused me of sending those secret documents anywhere. I do not appreciate the fact that the Prime Minister uses his office to example what he said is a lie and an untruth by an untruth himself.

         It is true that I did, in the process of asking that question, describe the documents as being in an unregistered parcel. That is true. I said that the copies were in unsealed envelopes. The jury does not know the answer to that. I said that the secret letters were addressed to a white Australian male by the name of McLachlan. They were—both to Mr Tickner's offsider and also to me—so that is true.

         I admit that if I exaggerated at all I said that the documents were sent around to these people like flotsam from a wreck. But on no occasion has anybody ever accused me of sending those secret documents around, except the Prime Minister. Either he has not bothered to do the work or he himself has exampled what he said was an untruth by using one in this parliament not once but twice today. I raise the issue because in the tenor of the debate today tempers got a bit rough and I did not think I would have a chance in a personal explanation to make these points.

         If we are on the subject of untruths and lies, as we were today, lies can get around by omission. If the Prime Minister is going to throw that sort of stuff around, as the only person who seems to be ruthless enough to do it, and the going is to get as rough as that, perhaps there are a few questions he might like to answer himself. For example, he has been asked many times in this place whether his company was helping to pollute the areas up near Scone some years ago when that piggery was up there. He did not answer those questions. He has been asked in this place and in another place whether he knew that the subsequent buyer for his share would be an Indonesian.

         The Prime Minister might well address himself to the question of how the Commonwealth Bank managed, on the eve of the last election, to have a television program pulled—that is, removed—from a television station in this country which was going to be on the subject of a provision made by the Commonwealth Bank in regard to the Prime Minister's debts. He might also like to address the question of whether he or any business entity that he or his family has ever been involved in had any debt forgiven by the Commonwealth Bank or written down in the last few years while he has occupied the position of Treasurer or Prime Minister of this country. If he is so interested in the truth, let us see whether he can answer those questions.

I will be looking at it further to show the people of the peninsula exactly what is happening to their power and what will happen under this firm.

It has subsequently been drawn to the minister's attention that the statement is completely incorrect, yet he has taken no action whatsoever to withdraw this disgraceful slur on a leading Australian company.

         The Peanut Marketing Board chairman at the time, Mr Jeff Rackemann, has stated publicly that the PMB has never imported Chinese peanuts. He pointed out the very obvious fact that they were leading the fight against the dumped Chinese peanuts. PMB Australia has never imported Chinese peanuts. In addition, it has never attempted to pass off foreign peanuts, imported peanuts, as a product of Australia. This point was emphasised again by the current manager of the Peanut Co., Bob Hansen. He was not the manager at the time, so he searched the company records. He has confirmed that they have never imported peanuts from China. The reason why they do not is that Chinese peanuts do not meet the health regulations. He again pointed out that PMB was leading the campaign to stop these imports.

         The chairman of the Burnett zone of the Queensland Graingrowers Association, Mr Trevor Rook, has also emphasised that the growers' organisation has never imported Chinese peanuts. So the minister's statements were completely false and completely inaccurate. I call on the minister to come into the chamber at the end of this adjournment debate and publicly retract his statements, to attempt to undo some of the commercial damage to the reputation of this leading company. He is aware that I am raising this matter tonight.

         It is hard enough to sell quality Australian peanuts on a corrupt world market without having what I regard as an irresponsible government minister seeking to blacken the reputation of the industry's leading sales organisation. The Minister for Resources must publicly retract his statement and apologise tothe PMB and to its shareholders. With these sorts of statements, one wonders about this government's standards of integrity and honesty.
