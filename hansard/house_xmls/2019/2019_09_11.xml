                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2019 is an example of the government's commitment to protect children in Australia and overseas from the dangers of sexual exploitation and abuse and to improve justice outcomes for survivors of child sex offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sexual crimes against children destroy lives. The depraved individuals who prey on these most vulnerable members of our community for their own sexual gratification or financial gain are too often handed short jail terms and are released into the community without any supervision, or worse still, without serving a single day in prison. Meanwhile victims are left to face the resulting trauma for the rest of their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These current sentencing practices for Commonwealth child sex offences are out of step with community expectations, they do not reflect the severity of the harm inflicted by these predators, and they fail to protect our children and communities from further offending. This government is completely committed to ensuring that the predators who commit these heinous crimes receive the sorts of sentences that the community would expect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill achieves this through reforms that target inadequacies in the existing legal framework at key points in the criminal justice process from bail and sentencing to post release supervision. It also provides the tools to combat emerging forms of child sexual abuse which is becoming increasingly prevalent due to technological developments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill complements a broad package of reforms already introduced by the coalition during the 45th parliament, which strengthened the laws relating to child sexual abuse and created new protections for the community. This included tough new measures to stop child sex offenders from travelling overseas to abuse children and the introduction of Carly's law, which targets online predators who use the internet to prepare or plan to sexually abuse children.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many Australians, this government is fed up with lenient sentencing practices that fail to protect the community from child sex offenders. This bill will vastly improve justice outcomes and community safety through a range of measures: </span>

                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">mandatory minimum sentences for the most serious child sex offences and for recidivist offenders</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">ensuring that all sex offenders, upon release from custody, are adequately supervised and subject to appropriate rehabilitative conditions</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">preventing courts from discounting sentences on the basis of good character where this is used to facilitate the crime, and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">emphasising the importance of access to rehabilitation and treatment when sentencing child sex offenders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last financial year, 39 per cent of Commonwealth child sex offenders walked away with a non-custodial sentence following their convictions for child sex crimes. In the majority of cases in the last five years where offenders did receive sentences of actual imprisonment, the most common total sentence was just 18 months with six months being served in custody.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Too often, child sex offenders spend insufficient time in custody to undergo even treatment programs or receive any significant rehabilitation before being eligible for release back into the community. Further, upon their release, many are not subject to parole or any other form of supervision, posing a continuing threat to community safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill addresses this unacceptable situation by introducing a sentencing presumption in favour of actual imprisonment, rebuttable only in exceptional circumstances. This will reduce the number of wholly suspended sentences being handed down for Commonwealth child sex offenders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill introduces minimum terms of five to seven years for the most serious child sex offences. This represents approximately 25 per cent of the available maximum penalty for such offences. Recidivist child sex offenders will also face minimum sentences from one to four years across the spectrum of child sex offences at the Commonwealth level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In all cases judges will retain complete discretion in the setting of the minimum amount of time the offender spends in custody. This will ensure they retain broad capacity to tailor sentences that foster rehabilitation and allow for suitable post-release supervision of offenders. This means that offenders should no longer be released unconditionally back into the community and will instead be supervised and subject to strict conditions—ensuring the best outcomes for community safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Judges will also retain discretion to deviate from the minimum terms set statutorily by up to 25 per cent each, to allow for the recognition of early guilty pleas and cooperation with law enforcement. This is an important provision to ensure we do not disincentivise demonstrations of remorse by offenders that facilitate the administration of justice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also contains exemptions to the minimum sentencing scheme for offenders who are under 18 when they commit an offence. Young people engaging in conduct such as 'sexting' will therefore not be caught up in the mandatory imprisonment scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The existing protections in the Crimes Act for persons suffering from a mental illness or intellectual disability will still apply to people charged with child sex offences—the bill will just ensure that a court can make a residential treatment order, if they consider that order appropriate in all the circumstances, and where available under state and territory law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A further safeguard is that law enforcement officers and prosecutors will retain their broad discretion regarding whether or not to charge or prosecute individuals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of mandatory sentencing complements a new presumption in favour of cumulative sentences for multiple child sex offences. This will ensure that sentences imposed adequately reflect the harm done to each individual victim, or the harm done by each distinct individual crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The presumption in favour of cumulative sentences can be set aside if the court is satisfied that imposing sentences concurrently or with only partial cumulation will produce a sentence of appropriate severity. The principle of totality will also continue to apply in the sentencing exercise to guard against unjust outcomes.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Disturbing new forms of child sex abuse are on the rise due to technological developments and increased global interconnectedness. This bill will fill gaps in the existing framework by introducing new offences to cover emerging forms of child sex abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An ever-increasing number of online services profit from providing or facilitating the exchange and production of child abuse material. Currently, individuals behind such services can only be prosecuted where it can be proven they are also accessing child abuse material or encouraging others to do so. This bill will introduce a new offence allowing a sentence of up to 20 years imprisonment, to ensure the providers of such services can be held to account for facilitating access to, and encouraging the production of, child abuse material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also introduces a new offence criminalising the grooming of third parties to make it easier to procure children to engage in sexual activity in Australia and overseas. This is necessary to combat the growing prevalence of offenders grooming adults, such as parents or carers, domestically or in developing countries via the internet, with the aim of ultimately procuring a child for sexual abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also clarifies the scope of existing offences to create greater certainty regarding the types of acts covered. For example it clarifies that engaging in sexual activity with a child will include live online streaming of sexual abuse of children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to new aggravated forms of child sex offences and other aggravating factors, the government is deeply disturbed by the emerging trend where offenders inflict severe violence on children alongside sexual abuse. To ensure that this conduct is thoroughly and appropriately punished, the bill will criminalise activities that aggravate particular types of sexual offending such as subjecting a child to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, or causing the death of the child.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also introduces new aggravating factors that a court must take into account when sentencing an offender for a relevant offence. These would apply if the victim was under the age of 10 at the time of the offending and if multiple people were involved in the offending.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to protecting vulnerable persons, the government remains committed to strengthening the protections afforded to child and other vulnerable witnesses giving evidence in Commonwealth criminal proceedings. This bill improves justice outcomes by limiting the re-traumatisation of vulnerable witnesses by removing barriers to the admission of prerecorded video evidence and ensuring that they are not subject to cross-examination at committal and other preliminary hearings, thus allowing them to put their best evidence forward at trial. These measures are also in line with recommendations made by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to bail, another important community protection measure introduced through this bill is the establishment of a presumption against bail for recidivist child sex offenders or those charged with the most serious child sex offences. This presumption against bail is rebuttable and courts may still grant bail if satisfied that it is appropriate in all the circumstances to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In considering bail for repeat child sex offenders or those charged with the most serious child sex offences, there is an expectation that, for the safety of the community, bail should be refused, unless the accused person can satisfy the court there are circumstances which justify their conditional release.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to post release options, at the other end of the justice process, this bill introduces a requirement for the courts to set treatment and supervision conditions for all child sex offenders upon sentencing to prevent such offenders from being released without supervision and appropriate treatment conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To better protect the community, this bill also introduces community safety as a primary consideration when deciding whether a federal offender's parole should be revoked.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also ensure that where an offender's parole has been revoked they can expect to serve a period of time in custody.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By way of conclusion, the bill signifies this government's commitment to addressing child sex offences that occur both domestically and overseas and to ensuring that the Australian community is protected from these heinous crimes. This government is committed to protecting vulnerable children from these abhorrent crimes, and will be seeking to urgently pass these measures this year, to enable these present inadequacies in sentencings and other inadequacies in the criminal justice system to be addressed as soon as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These new measures are utterly essential to end the all-too-common scenario of child sex offenders walking free with no supervision after conviction or following brief terms of imprisonment. Such outcomes offend community values and expectations for how crimes of this nature will be dealt with, they compound the pain and trauma of victims and they further endanger the safety of the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For too long, child sex offenders have been receiving inadequate sentences for their crimes that are completely out of step with community expectations. It is time for this to change. On that basis, I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill 2019 (the bill) amends the National Health Act 1953 to implement the Morrison government's election commitment to reduce the safety net thresholds that apply to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) medicines.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PBS has been providing affordable access to medicines for Australians for over 60 years and is rightly respected and valued for the high-quality, cost-effective services it delivers. It is one of the signature health programs that sets the Australian health system apart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is committed to supporting the PBS with every fibre of its being and, above all else, the patients it serves. We have a deep and profound commitment to list every new medicine recommended by the independent expert Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2013 we have made more than 2,100 new or amended medicines listings on the PBS through an additional investment of around $10.6 billion dollars.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the PBS, patients can access medicines that in some cases would cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars per year for a maximum of $6.50 per script for concession card holders, or a maximum of $40.30 for non-concessional patients. Patients receive free or reduced cost scripts once they reach their safety net.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ninety-one percent of PBS scripts each year (186 million) are dispensed to concession card holders, including pensioners and low-income earners, meaning they pay no more than $6.50 per script for medicines that without subsidy would cost much more than that. Twenty percent of concession scripts (37 million scripts) are free of charge because patients have reached their safety net.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, in that context, proposes amendments which will reduce the PBS safety net threshold amounts from 1 January 2020 for all Australians who use the PBS. In effect, it will make the acquisition of medicines cheaper for patients who have chronic needs and who are frequent users of the PBS to meet their health requirements. The bill will enable PBS patients to reach the safety net earlier in the calendar year and provide them earlier access to free or reduced-cost PBS medicines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically, the safety net threshold for concessional patients will be reduced from 60 PBS concessional co-payments to 48 PBS concessional co-payments. This will reduce the concessional safety net threshold to an estimated $316.80 in 2020. Without this proposal, the 2020 concessional safety net threshold would have risen to an estimated $396.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The safety net threshold for general patients will reduce from the 2019 level of $1,550.70 to $1,486.80. Without this proposal, the 2020 general safety net threshold would have risen to $1,586.40. It's an effective saving of $100.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes will benefit approximately 1.6 million concessional patients and 129,000 general patients, allowing them to reach the PBS safety net sooner and reduce their out-of-pocket health costs by $80 per year for the majority of patients who are on the concessional scheme, and up to $100 per year for patients who are not on the concessional scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will be particularly helpful for Australians whose treatment requires a larger number of PBS prescription medicines every year—for example, patients with chronic conditions such as heart disease, high cholesterol, arthritis, asthma, diabetes and cancer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular it will assist more vulnerable Australians, such as those with a pensioner concession card, Australian seniors health card or a healthcare card. It will also provide benefit for gold-, white- and orange-card holders under the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</span>
                </p>

                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government's commitment to the PBS is rock solid. It is a fundamental pillar of our belief as a party, as a movement and as a government. Together with Medicare, it is a foundation of our world-class health system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes proposed in this bill will further improve affordability of PBS medicines, and I am confident they will be welcomed by all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The aim of this government is to ensure that Australians have timely access to affordable medicines. This bill and these changes will directly benefit the people who most need access to medically-necessary and often life-saving prescription medicines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ability to list medicines such as Orkambi for cystic fibrosis, which would otherwise have cost a quarter of a million dollars a year, or Spinraza for spinal muscular atrophy at well over $300,000 a year or Kalydeco for beautiful young children between 12 and 24 months with cystic fibrosis, which would cost in the order of $300,000 a year, is, in my belief, one of the hallmarks of a great society. It is something which is fundamental to our belief and is something which we will continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government, therefore, has a commitment to list all medicines on the PBS when recommended to do so by the medical experts. That recommendation is, however, a legal precondition before we can make such recommendations, and it's a precondition that those recommendations are complied with before we can complete the listing process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will continue, therefore, to list all new medicines on the PBS. I have to say that this is in contrast to the previous government, who in 2011 stopped the listing of some new medicines for the simple reason that they could not manage the economy. As the budget papers of the day said, due to fiscal circumstances the government will defer the listing of some new medicines until fiscal circumstances permit. Under us, fiscal circumstances will always permit the listing of new medicines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Changes to the PBS safety net were a fundamental commitment to the Australian people at the recent election, and we are delivering on that commitment today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Due to our strong economic management we are able to make these changes, reducing the out-of-pocket costs for patients who access the medicines they need through the PBS. I am delighted to commend this bill to the House.</span>

The scheme provides eligible working parents with 18 weeks of payment at a rate based on the national minimum wage, currently $740.60 per week—a total of $13,330.80 over 18 weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government considers that working parents should be entitled to paid leave to spend important bonding time with their newborn or newly adopted child in those important early months. This bill provides for a more generous work test to make it fairer for women who have a long and genuine working history yet still often fail the work test because of the industry in which they are employed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 January 2020, a longer break between two working days will be allowed under the paid parental leave work test rules.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To meet the current paid parental leave work test, a parent must have worked 330 hours in 10 of the 13 months before the child's date of birth. A parent can have a break of up to eight weeks between two working days in this period and will satisfy the present work test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In some professions, such as teaching, there may routinely be a longer break between two work days, which prevents mothers from accessing parental leave pay, despite having a legitimate attachment to the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government believes that these working mothers should be entitled to paid leave to allow them time to recover from the birth, bond with their baby and receive the health and developmental benefits that the Paid Parental Leave scheme can help facilitate. Hopefully to return to teaching sometime in the future, with the important role of educating our children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To address circumstances such as those faced by casual teachers, the permissible break between two working days will be increased to 12 weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This change will make sure more women with a genuine connection to work are able to access the government's Paid Parental Leave scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To further enhance the fairness of the paid parental leave system, the work test rules will also be modified to take into account circumstances where pregnant women are in occupations where it would be unsafe for them to continue working during their pregnancy, so that they are able to get paid parental leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the new rules, the work test would begin 392 days immediately before the day on which the mother ceased work because of the hazards in her job, meaning more women in dangerous industries will now be eligible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was never the intention of the Paid Parental Leave scheme that a mother should miss out because the nature of her job poses a risk to her and her child's health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These important changes to the Paid Parental Leave scheme are about improving the fairness of the current system and providing support for genuine working mothers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The relocation scholarship primarily assists students from regional and remote areas of Australia moving away from home to study. Continuing to pay the relocation scholarship to students moving away from an overseas home to Australia is not consistent policy with the purpose of the scholarship to assist regional and remote students with additional costs they face.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Students undertaking part-time study loads do not generally incur the same study costs as those studying full time, as many of the costs associated with study are proportionate to study load. This includes the purchase of textbooks, stationery, and transport costs. It's appropriate for the rates of the pensioner education supplement and education entry payment to reflect this.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will establish a two-year trial of drug testing for 5,000 new recipients of Newstart allowance and youth allowance (other). This bill demonstrates the government's commitment to breaking down barriers that prevent people from getting a job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Data shows us that substance abuse is directly impacting the ability of jobseekers to undertake job search or activities to get them into work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2018-19 financial year, there were 5,247 occasions when a jobseeker attempted to use drug or alcohol dependency as a reason for not meeting their mutual obligation requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, between 1 January 2018 and 31 July 2019, a total of 8,638 jobseekers participated in a drug or alcohol treatment activity as part of their mutual obligation requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The community has a right to expect that taxpayer funded welfare payments are not being used to fund drug and alcohol addiction and that jobseekers do all they can to find a job, including addressing any barriers they have which prevent them from doing so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's 2016 National Drug Strategy Household Survey showed that those who were unemployed were three times more likely to have recently used drugs such as ice and other amphetamines than those who were employed. For too long, not enough has been done to try to deal with the real connection between drug abuse and unemployment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The trial established by this bill will assess the use of drug testing as a means of identifying jobseekers with substance abuse issues that may be preventing them from finding a job, and supporting them to address these barriers through interventions such as income management and referral to the appropriate treatment that they require.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The drug-testing trial is complemented by the government's other substance misuse measures, including ensuring that all jobseekers are able to undertake drug and alcohol treatment as an approved activity in their job plan. Since the start of that measure on 1 January 2018, 5,047 stream A and B jobseekers have participated in drug or alcohol treatment activity as part of their job plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Together, these measures recognise that supporting jobseekers to address their substance abuse issues through appropriate treatment is a critical first step on the path to employment. This will benefit not just the jobseekers themselves but also their families and the wider community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The trial will operate in three locations: Canterbury Bankstown in New South Wales, Logan in Queensland and Mandurah in Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trial sites were chosen based on careful consideration of the available evidence and data, including:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has announced a dedicated treatment fund of up to $10 million to support jobseekers in the drug-testing trial across all three locations, after listening to feedback from the drug and alcohol treatment sector. The treatment fund will provide for additional treatment support in the trial locations where the existing state or Commonwealth services and supports are not sufficient to meet additional demand due to the trial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is in addition to the more than $780 million the government has already committed over four years, from July 2018, to reduce the impact of drug and alcohol abuse on individuals, families and communities. This includes funding to support the National Ice Action Strategy<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>to tackle the scourge of ice, especially in regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Drug testing will coincide with Services Australia appointments and will be conducted in private by a qualified representative from a contracted third-party drug-testing provider. Depending on what kind of test people have been selected for, the test will either take place at a local Services Australia office or at a nearby facility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Comprehensive rules will be set out in a legislative instrument to ensure that testing is conducted appropriately and in accordance with the relevant standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be appropriate consequences for people who deliberately miss an appointment without a reasonable excuse or refuse a drug test in order to avoid a positive result. If a jobseeker refuses to take a drug test, having acknowledged that they may be required to do so as part of their condition of payment, their payment will be cancelled and they will not be able to reapply for a four-week period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Jobseekers who test positive to a drug test will have their payments placed on income management to limit their ability to use their payments to further fund their harmful drug use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this way, 80 per cent of a jobseeker's normal payment will be quarantined to pay bills and purchase goods, and the remaining 20 per cent will be paid into their regular bank account, accessible as cash to pay for discretionary items.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Jobseekers who test positive will also be subject to a second drug test within 25 working days and may also be subject to further subsequent tests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Jobseekers who test positive to more than one drug test during the trial will be referred to a Services Australia contracted medical professional with experience in drug and alcohol treatment. This is critically important. This is about getting those people who need support services the services that they require. They will assess the jobseeker's particular circumstances and identify the appropriate treatment and support options.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the report from the medical professional recommends treatment, the jobseeker will be required to participate in one or more treatment activities to address their substance abuse as part of their Job Plan. This could include activities such as rehabilitation or counselling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not about penalising jobseekers. This is not about penalising those with drug abuse issues. It is about finding new and better ways of supporting those jobseekers with drug abuse issues to overcome the barriers to work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no good that jobseekers with drug abuse issues, as part of their mutual obligation requirements, are required to search for work in a futile attempt when they are dealing with drug and alcohol issues. This is about identifying the people that need the support and connecting them with the support services that are available, and that's why additional funding is part of this trial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be a comprehensive evaluation of the trial to determine which aspects have been successful in addressing welfare recipients' substance abuse and barriers to employment.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, to qualify for the age pension or DSP, a person must be an Australian resident for a total of 10 years, with at least five of those years being continuous. However, there is no requirement for those 10 years to be during a person's working life—that is, between 16 years of age and age-pension age—or for a person to demonstrate self-sufficiency during that time.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second measure in the bill will cease payment of the basic amount of the pension supplement. The pension supplement is designed to alleviate the cost-of-living pressures for income support recipients living in Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The basic amount of pension supplement is equivalent to the former GST supplement, which was introduced to compensate recipients for increases in the cost of living as a result of the GST. Income support recipients who are outside of Australia for more than six weeks, or who leave Australia permanently, do not need to receive this ongoing compensation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The liquid assets test waiting period is the period of time that a person claiming youth allowance, Austudy, Newstart allowance or sickness allowance is expected to use their liquid assets—such as cash, bank deposits, shares—for self-support before relying on taxpayer funded income support.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The liquid assets test waiting period may be between one and 13 weeks, depending on the amount of liquid assets the person has. The length of the waiting period increases by one week for every $500 held above the threshold for single people with no children, or $1,000 for couples and people with children.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, a single person with no children and $5,500 in liquid assets would serve a one-week liquid assets test waiting period. A person with $6,000 would serve two weeks. This ensures that the liquid assets test waiting period better reflects the current profile of claimants and their capacity to support themselves.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government recognises that the BasicsCard, while effective, can restrict an individual's ability of choice. Currently, the BasicsCard only works in stores that have signed a merchant agreement with my department, the Department of Human Services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In comparison, the cashless debit card works everywhere except when individuals try to purchase alcohol, gambling products and some gift cards, and to withdraw cash. The cashless debit card provides income management participants with greater consumer choice and autonomy while reducing red tape for businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has trialled both income management, through the BasicsCard, and the cashless debit card in different communities to improve financial management and reduce social harm. While the government recognises the effectiveness the BasicsCard has had on the communities in which it has operated, it is time to provide income management participants in the Northern Territory and Cape York region with the opportunities that the cashless debit card brings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government recognises that we must continue to work in partnership with communities, stakeholders and most importantly participants to support the transition to the cashless debit card.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Therefore, this bill outlines that the transition will occur slowly over a nine-month period, from 1 April 2020. This will allow the transition to occur community by community, and the Department of Social Services, together with the Department of Human Services, will work with communities and individuals to provide support for the transition every step of the way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will work with communities to ensure each and every participant transitions from the BasicsCard to the cashless debit card as smoothly as possible. And we have allocated almost $18 million to support participants in the transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also recognises that this transition will affect a large number of Indigenous Australians across both the Northern Territory and the Cape York region. We will work with these Indigenous communities and individuals to ensure that resources will be available in a range of local Indigenous languages and there will be access to interpreters as required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has brought forward this bill to continue the cashless debit card trials and transition income management participants onto this technology because we believe in the positive effect the card is having in the communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The extension of the card across these four communities will allow time for further evaluation activities of the card to be completed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These evaluation activities will build on the findings of the first evaluation report and will inform future decisions about the program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cashless debit card is a community driven, bottom-up approach to tackling long-term welfare dependency, social harm and welfare-funded drug and alcohol abuse.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  I rise to speak on the Aged Care Amendment (Movement of Provisionally Allocated Places) Bill 2019. I commend the government on allowing approved providers of residential aged care to move provisionally allocated residential aged-care places from one region to another within a state or territory and for allowing approved providers to operationalise a residential aged-care place more quickly. This will allow the more efficient allocation of resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Warringah, 15.7 per cent of the total population is aged over 65 years, and this will significantly increase as 55.1 per cent of the population will be 65 and over by 2036. The complex needs of an ageing population will impose an increasing demand on healthcare services. The elderly deserve respectful, affordable, accessible and safe aged-care options. Warringah residents want aged care that promotes independence and wellbeing with choices so people can stay at home longer while being healthy and connected, and more options for a suitable mix of home help and medical support. And, if residential care is the right choice for them, it must be safe and secure and appropriately resourced to support wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the royal commission is revealing some shocking problems in the sector, in our aged-care system there are other challenges as well. There are almost 130,000 Australians in the home care priority queue with many waiting more than a year for assistance. Once funding is granted, home care providers are taking a large amount of the funding in administration costs and profit. Families face a lack of accountability, little information on provider performance, and hidden charges and exit fees. In residential care, many find a lack of registered nurses and other needed care, which contributes to more residents ending up in hospital emergency departments. Residents also find aged care isolating and to the detriment of their mental health, and when they try and reach out they discover a lack of access to mental health services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I am calling on the government to provide more flexible Medicare funding for home help, telehealth and medical support, provide more information on providers to support informed choices, implement the recommendations of the aged care royal commission when they come to hand, support wellness programs to reduce loneliness and improve mental health, and increase funding for dementia care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this bill will allow the more efficient allocation of provisional places, we must also discuss not just access to placements for our elderly but the quality of care our elderly receive when in our aged-care system. We know that properly staffed homes are essential to welfare, but people do not know if homes are adequately staffed before they send their parents or relatives to residency. That is why I also support the member for Mayo's private member's bill, which is the Aged Care Amendment (Staffing Ratio Disclosure) Bill 2019. This bill will require providers to disclose their carer-to-patient ratio. Older Australians deserve our support and our every effort on their behalf to improve their quality of care.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:34</span>):  This bill, the Aged Care Amendment (Movement of Provisionally Allocated Places) Bill 2019, allows for the movement of provisional bed places from one region to another within a state or a territory. It is a sensible proposal. However, the legislation relates to a critical social issue confronting Australia. I refer to the services available to older Australians and the care provided to them—services that are too often difficult to access and care that on too many occasions, in too many places, has failed elderly Australians. The failures and the public's reaction to them have resulted in the royal commission into aged care that is now under way. Only last month another case of a residential care failure was exposed at a state-run facility in South Australia's Riverland. Simultaneously, more aged-care facilities are now failing to meet their accreditation standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not surprised to hear those stories. As a member of the Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport, which inquired into the aged-care sector and reported back in October last year, I heard firsthand from residents, family members, workers, service providers, health professionals and operators of those facilities about what was needed. It was not only some facility operators that failed in their duty of care to residents, but also the government departments that were responsible for the oversight and accreditation of facilities. The government has taken some steps towards improving the inspection and accreditation process, but it needs to do much more and it needs to do much more now. It does not need to wait until the royal commission has concluded in order to address matters that are well known and that would immediately make a difference to residential care. The 14 recommendations of the House of Representatives committee's report would be a good start. The committee met with people from right around the country. As I said earlier, it heard from all stakeholders in the sector. The recommendations have been before the government for nearly a year. Most of those recommendations are properly thought through, commonsense recommendations that would immediately make a difference to the type of care that is available. The government could act on them right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I make it absolutely clear that there are good and bad operators in the sector, as there are in all industry sectors. I regularly visit aged-care facilities in my electorate. Overwhelmingly they provide a very high standard of care. Only last Friday I visited the Estia aged-care centre at Hope Valley. Last week was Royal Adelaide Show week, so staff at the Estia centre brought the show spirit to the residents with a fantastic display of show stalls and entertainment within the facility itself. The staff at the centre went to extraordinary lengths to organise the in-house event, and I commend them for their efforts. I take this opportunity also to express my gratitude to the aged-care workers and other health professionals and service providers who work in facilities throughout Australia for the incredibly important work that they all do. It is work that many others would not do: caring for older people, many of whom who have no ability to care for themselves and who need assistance with everything they require in their everyday life. Yet the staff in these aged-care centres do their work day in and day out, often under time pressures because of the number of residents they need to care for or the level of care that those residents need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My understanding is that over 50 per cent of residents in an aged-care facility across the country have dementia. Workers need special skills in order to support residents with dementia. It's also my understanding that by mid-century about a million Australians will be suffering from some form of dementia, so the demand is getting greater all the time. Those aged-care workers need more recognition. It is time that we gave them the recognition they deserve, gave them the support they deserve and remunerated them at a level that reflects the important work they do. They too have patiently been asking for too long to be treated with the respect that they need in order to carry out the work they do to provide the dignity to the residents that they care for that those residents also deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016-17, the last year for which figures were available when the House committee prepared its report, 240,000 Australians received permanent residential care in about 2,670 facilities across the country. At any given time there are around 200,000 people being cared for in an aged-care facility. This legislation provides flexibility for the aged-care beds that are available within those centres and within the states and territories, as I said from the outset. However, we could and should be doing a lot more. We know that people prefer to remain in their own home if they can access the home care that they need as well. Accessing home care packages under the Morrison government is becoming farcical. As other speakers on this side of the House have made absolutely clear, there are about 129,000 people waiting for a package or the appropriate package for which they have been assessed. Nearly 76,000 of those people have no package at all, and the 53,000 with a lower-level package are desperately waiting for a higher-level package. And the waiting list is getting longer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the government claims that they are putting extra funding into the aged-care package system, the reality is that the extra funding is not even keeping up with demand. My understanding is that we have currently around 93,000 Australians in receipt of an aged-care package. Simultaneously, we have 129,000 people on the waiting list and, of those, nearly 76,000 have no package at all. So that tells me that there are more people on the waiting list than packages that are actually available. It also tells me that those people that are on the waiting list are very likely only ever to get a package when one of the 93,000 people in receipt of a package right now either passes away or goes into a residential aged-care facility. In other words, they will only get a package when someone else relinquishes theirs. It is not good enough to have a system that is dependent on one person relinquishing a package so that somebody else can access it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Franklin, sitting at the table right now, pointed out in her own remarks, people are actually dying whilst they wait to get a package. I understand that some 16,000 have passed away or been admitted to residential care facilities. Some 14,000 have had to do that because they couldn't wait any longer and they desperately needed support. It wasn't available in their own home, so they had to move into a residential care facility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I'm speaking about home care, I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the thousands of volunteers around Australia who provide Meals on Wheels to older people living in their own homes. Last week I attended the annual general meeting of the Modbury branch of Meals on Wheels in Adelaide. That branch has now delivered, since its inception around 30 years ago, nearly a million meals to people in the community that I represent. Currently, they deliver about 30,000 meals a year. It's a service that enables people to stay in their own home, and I believe it's a cost-effective service because the meals are delivered by volunteers. Meals on Wheels Australia, I know, is pleading for extra federal government funding to enable them to continue to provide the services they do at an affordable cost to those residents who would like to stay in their own home, and I believe this government should also look to supporting Meals on Wheels with greater funding so that they can actually do that. It is a simple way of actually helping people do exactly what they want to do, and that is stay in their own home for as long as they can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that the royal commission into the aged care sector may be providing its interim report next month. I would hope that, as a result of that report, the government gets on with responding to the needs that have been outlined time and time again, through a series of different reports over recent years, as to what could and should be done to provide a better level of care to people in residential aged-care facilities. We also know that, currently, about 15 per cent of the Australian population is 65 years or older and that by mid-century that figure will be around 20 per cent. We have a system that is currently under stress, that is failing to meet the needs of older people and that is actually growing. It is growing at a rate at which, if something isn't done urgently, older people will be suffering even more than many of them already are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My office is regularly contacted by people who have applied for an aged-care package, and they have been waiting patiently. In some of those cases I have spoken to people personally and I know their circumstances; they are genuine cases of people in real need, people that cannot wait any longer. These are not people trying to rort the system. These are people that would have preferred not to have had to even apply for a package, but they do so because it is the only way that they can remain in their own homes. Yet I see people waiting months and months before they get that support, along with other support that older Australians need through a whole range of other services that they also apply for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we know that the population in Australia is ageing; if we know, in many cases, what the problems are within the current system; if we know what the demands are; and if we know what most of the solutions are—and it requires more support and more funding from this government—then I believe the government has a moral obligation to act. It cannot continue to keep kicking the can down the road by saying, 'We will wait for the royal commission's report in October.' Even then, that won't be its final report; it'll probably be next year before we get the final report. When we get that, as we have seen with the banking royal commission, it might be one or two years before the government brings down its recommendations on how it's going to respond in this place to the royal commission's recommendations. That tells me that it will be years before older people in this country see some real change to the services that are needed. It will be years before the changes that will make a real difference to their lives are implemented by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Reform is needed now. Funding is needed now. The aged-care system is already struggling, as the member for Franklin quite rightly pointed out in her address in this place when she moved her amendment. We need to act now. We need to do so because the older people of this country deserve to live out their last few years with the dignity and respect each and every one of us would want for ourselves or for our parents. I urge the government not to keep delaying what it knows needs to be done but to get on with the job of responding to the needs of the older Australians with the care and compassion that they deserve.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Minister for Government Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  I thank all members who have contributed to the debate on the Aged Care Amendment (Movement of Provisionally Allocated Places) Bill 2019. The Australian population is ageing, and senior Australians and their families deserve to have access to high-quality aged care and services when they need them. Integral to this is supporting approved providers to make residential aged-care places ready for use as quickly as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Constructing aged-care homes is a difficult, time-consuming and expensive exercise. It is not uncommon for providers to finish aged-care homes with fewer rooms than originally intended due to either planning or construction issues. Where this is the case, the Aged Care Act 1997 needs to be flexible enough to allow these leftover places to be moved to another suitable location. Similarly, a provider may find a more suitable or affordable location for an aged-care home a few minutes drive from the planning region to which the places were originally allocated. Again, the act needs to be flexible enough to allow this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments within this bill seek to add flexibility to the act by allowing provisionally allocated residential aged-care places to be moved from one region to another where a provider can demonstrate that the movement is in the interests of aged-care consumers, there is a clear need for places in the new region and it is not detrimental to the region to which the provisionally allocated places are currently allocated. This change is in the best interests of all older Australians and the broader community. It will remove a potential barrier to the community in accessing residential aged care, thereby aligning with the government's commitment to ensuring delivery of high-quality aged care and services when and where they're needed. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Franklin has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the amendment moved by the member for Franklin be agreed to.</span>

Anything that makes it easier and safer to remove carbon dioxide from the supply chain and store it is welcomed by members on this side of the House. We also acknowledge that NOPSEMA is the best agency to manage and monitor offshore carbon storage in this country. These bills strengthen the monitoring, inspection and enforcement aspects of the agency, and that's a good thing, because NOPSEMA deals with both environmental management and workplace safety in an industry that can be risky both for workers and for our natural environment. However, these bills raise obvious questions. Where is the broader carbon capture and storage industry? How far along is it on its journey? We have here a series of amendments to better manage offshore carbon storage, but where is the storage? Where is that broader plan?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are, of course, a resource-rich country and consequently we currently have a power system that relies on fossil fuels for around 86 per cent of utility-grade electricity generation. Burning these fuels generates greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming. I won't take the time to revisit the science on this occasion; I think members know it well—although there are many, even though they might know it well, who continue to deny the conclusions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2019 and the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Amendment Bill 2019, as responsible as they are, remind us that the government is doing little to incentivise the storage of our carbon emissions. These bills, for example, do nothing to address the fact that this government, for six years now, has turned its back not only on a serious climate policy but also on a workable, investable, bankable carbon framework. The Prime Minister and his energy minister can't hide from their own data. Carbon emissions in Australia continue to rise year on year. According to the Department of the Environment and Energy's latest accounting, in the year to March 2019 Australia's carbon emissions rose 0.6 per cent, which is no surprise given the government's only plan is to waste an additional $2 billion on Tony Abbott's failed climate policy, on top of the $2.55 billion already allocated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first Emissions Reduction Fund auction conducted by the government since the May election has delivered abatement of only 0.6 per cent. The government claim abatement will be delivered through their so-called Climate Solutions Fund but, based on these results, it will take their policy some 833 years to deliver the abatement results they've been promising for 2030. Carbon emissions have been continuously rising since 2014 after coming down by more than 10 per cent during the period of the last Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth reminding the House that the architecture put in place by the former Labor government, all that time ago, was torn up by this government early in its first term, following the 2013 election. Think about that, Mr Deputy Speaker: if we had that architecture in place still, some leaders who don't lead their parties anymore might still be leading their parties; Australia would now be well into a settled architecture that would be doing no harm to our economy and would have us better than on track to meet our Paris commitments; none of us would be so often distracted, as we are, by arguments about where energy policy in this country is heading; and we wouldn't be having as many fights about energy prices for consumers and for business, because that policy would be settled and we'd be concentrating on other things, including the matter we're discussing today—that is, carbon capture and storage.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's own projections show that the government will now miss their 2020 Kyoto commitment of a five per cent cut on 2000 levels. Their own projections also show that emissions will keep rising all the way to 2030, missing the government's 2030 emissions reduction target by a full 19 per cent. So where does carbon capture and storage come into this confused policy area? According to the International Energy Agency, carbon capture and storage can remove up to 85 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions from power stations. That, of course, should be of interest to Australia and Australians because we're still so heavily dependent on coal-fired generation; indeed, it makes up about 73 per cent of our production. The IEA's Sustainable Development Scenario says that seven per cent of required global cumulative emissions reductions to 2040 will come from carbon utilisation and storage. This will effectively increase carbon capture and storage from around 30 million tonnes of CO2 captured annually to more than 2.3 billion tonnes per year by 2040.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some very talented scientists and engineers have remarked that Australia's blend of suitable geology, depleted petroleum fields, coastal petroleum infrastructure and a plentiful supply of carbon dioxide are indeed a marriage made in heaven. We have a surplus of carbon emissions, as evidenced by our own growing emissions inventory, and we have the onshore and offshore areas for carbon injection where it can be sequestered for millions of years. We also have motivated industry players committed to carbon capture and storage. On Western Australia's Barrow Island, Chevron, Shell and ExxonMobil have already started injecting carbon dioxide into the earth in the largest carbon capture and storage project in the world. It will take some four million tonnes of carbon each year out of the Gorgon LNG operation. That project has so far cost US$2.5 billion. It's an expensive exercise.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Gippsland Basin, off the Victorian coast, the CarbonNet Project is building to being operational in around two years from now. It will take some five million tonnes of carbon each year from the Latrobe Valley coal-fired power stations and sequester it beneath the seabed. CarbonNet will be the biggest carbon capture and storage project in the world when it begins operation at full scale. The Offshore Petroleum Act amendments that we are considering today have been drafted largely to ensure the CarbonNet Project is both safe and efficient.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coal industry's COAL21 project should be injecting carbon into the earth's crust in June next year. That project will take 120,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year from the Millmerran power station west of Toowoomba and sequester it in the ground, where it will remain permanently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet even those involved in these projects would admit that their efforts are simply drops in the bucket compared to what we could be doing and what, as a country, we need to do. Australia's 2030 greenhouse gas emissions budget is expected to be around 440 million tonnes if we meet the 28 per cent Paris target. The projects I've just outlined will store less than 10 million tonnes. It gives you a sense of the scale of the challenge and the extent to which we are meeting that challenge. It makes Australians ask, obviously, where is the carbon policy? Even if the government can't get beyond its denialism, surely it shouldn't continue to deny this fantastic opportunity we have with respect to carbon storage?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell the House there is an appetite in the resources and energy sectors to do more in the CCS space. People talk to me about it all the time. They have the scientists, they have the engineers, they have the capital, they have the geology and they have the carbon. University teams are working on the solutions, and there are international energy corporations willing to invest in carbon capture and storage projects. The problem is that there is no policy framework from government, no guidance and no reassurance that these projects can stack up on a financial basis. There is no green light, or too few green lights, because the economic guidance is not there for the economic case to be made. The COAL21 and CarbonNet projects essentially prove the technology, and the Gorgon project also shows the conditions are there to do this work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For an ongoing carbon storage industry, industry need clear economic signals and, right now, they just don't have it. We've no carbon price mandated by the government. The cost of capturing and storing carbon dioxide falls somewhere between $55 and $80 per tonne. In the latest carbon credit auctions in June, the market traded carbon credits at less than $15. That's a gap of at least $40 per tonne.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know some members will be thinking, 'Do we have to talk about the carbon price again?' Of course we do. It has to be a part of the mix if we are to meet our Paris targets. I have not heard the Prime Minister say we're not still determined to meet our targets; I heard him say we're on track to do it. But of course we are not, and I have just provided the evidence of that, relying on the government's own agencies. We will need a mix of endeavours to meet those Paris targets and we are certainly not on track to do it. We need to start talking more about the elephant in the room. Again, if the former Labor government's architecture was not repealed by this government we wouldn't need to have this argument, but it is an argument we need to have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The United States seems to take a somewhat different approach. It has tax incentives built in to incentivise carbon capture and storage, mechanisms like 45Q. The American government will give you a tax credit of $35 per tonne if it's used to capture carbon for enhanced oil recovery. They give a $50 per tonne tax credit for storing carbon dioxide. That's an incentive; it's what they call a carrot and it's working for them. Part of the incentive means finding an industrial partner to take the carbon dioxide or even the hydrogen, as the CarbonNet Project will do with Japanese industrial partners who are developing hydrogen as a fuel. A new point is that the fiscal equation is changing. It may be that in the not-too-distant future we won't be storing the carbon, we'll be using the carbon as a product of value—possibly for example, in the hydrogen cycle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But here in Australia, we are falling behind. Right now, as one industry player has put it, you can get $15 per tonne tax credit for planting a tree that stores carbon for 60 years but you can't get any credit for storing millions of tonnes of carbon for 60 million years. I'm very supportive of the capacity to store carbon in our forests. But there's more we can do; much more we can do. Frankly, the carbon capture and storage projects at Gorgon, Gippsland and Millmerran are the exceptions, not the rule. They show us that it can be done but they also show us that we're not doing enough, and it points to a lack of government policy and guidance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need this government to stop investing in energy dismissal, denial and obfuscation simply because the subject always turns to climate. Even if you don't mention the word climate, you need to at least talk the language of industry, which is about greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon budget, our Paris commitments and, increasingly, a carbon price. The government needs to look under its nose. The oil and gas industry, the coal industry, the power industry, the steel industry, universities and some state governments are committing to carbon capture and storage. They acknowledge that an energy system as dependent on fossil fuels as Australia will not turn off the coal and gas plants tomorrow; we simply cannot. We'll continue to generate emissions, which means we need to be more active in the area of carbon capture and storage as we make the long transition to a greater reliance on renewables, which of course will increase year on year as more people put rooftop solar on their houses and business becomes more confident about investing in our energy sector. But they do not have sufficient confidence at the moment, because we still do not have an energy policy in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coal industry is not in denial. It's investing $550 million in low-emissions abatement, including carbon capture and storage. The industry is doing its bit and wants to do more. Of course, more broadly the Australian community continues to call for real action on climate change—real and meaningful action; not words, not spin and not avoidance of the facts. And we can have real action on climate change without doing harm to our economy. That has been proven by more than one economy around the world. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Climate of the nation 2019</span> report, released yesterday, highlights that Australians are increasingly concerned about the impacts of climate change. The survey shows that 81 per cent of Australians are concerned that climate change will result in more droughts and more flooding. Eighty per cent of Australians acknowledge we are already experiencing the impacts of climate change. The Investor Group on Climate Change, representing institutional investors, with $1.3 trillion under management, recently said policy uncertainty remains a major barrier to increased investment. Ninety per cent of investors are implementing low-carbon strategies. Over 80 per cent of investors are actively considering reporting under the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Yet in Australia the private sector has to take action in a policy vacuum. Given this situation, I applaud those who are doing something in the less than ideal circumstances of a lack of government guidance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even the Reserve Bank of Australia has been vocal about the need for the federal government to show leadership on climate change. In March, the deputy governor devoted an entire speech to the financial risk posed by climate change. After six years in government, the Liberals and the Nats have failed to deliver a credible and effective climate change policy. They have consistently undermined the transition to a cleaner energy system. They have avoided implementing any credible policies to cut pollution in the industrial, energy, transport and agriculture sectors. They have repeatedly dismissed domestic and international concerns about their lack of credible climate policies. The coalition government has defunded and abolished agencies which could develop or advise on policies, such as the Climate Change Authority, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Climate Commission. The government has no climate change adaptation policy, even as it becomes increasingly apparent that Australian communities and businesses are feeling the impacts of climate change. We see that with respect to the terrible bushfires playing out in northern New South Wales and in Queensland.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was in Stanthorpe not that long ago. I saw near-empty and empty dams. I saw orchards which had had their apple trees removed. I talked to vegetable growers who aren't planting this season, because there isn't sufficient water available. I spoke to people who are now on water restrictions and adjusting their lifestyles—no longer showering every night of the week. These are the realities you face when things become this bad. I spoke to people about nearby Tenterfield, where the council is now bringing in mobile desalination plants so they can extract water from bores that they wouldn't ordinarily extract from because of the saltiness of that water. I haven't checked, but I suspect these mobile plants may be run by diesel. If that's true, it seems a bit counterintuitive. These are the desperate things we need to do. In Stanthorpe the community expects that in the absence of substantial rain the town will be out of water by December. The mayor told me that because of the success of water measures in the community that may now extend to March. We all pray that that is the case, because that is three more months of opportunity for some meaningful rain. But I didn't feel any optimism with respect to that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course this government, now in its third term, doesn't have a comprehensive response. It doesn't have a drought strategy. There's a little policy here and a policy there. I heard the Deputy Prime Minister on his feet yesterday. He took a question from his own side about the impact of drought. I may stand corrected; there may have been three things; but I think he only made a couple of points. One was on the farm household allowance, which has been a disaster for this government and for the farming communities relying upon it. Too many people are unable to secure it, and now we have people coming off it because it's a time-limited welfare payment. It's the equivalent of an unemployment benefit for farmers with a more relaxed assets test, and we support it. Of course the government has always had one. Under the old exceptional circumstances arrangements there was a payment for farmers with a more relaxed income test. This is not new; this is not an initiative of the government. But it's the first time it's been time restricted, and it's the only time a government has had the implementation go so wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there is the Future Drought Fund. We are now six years into this government, and it will deliver something next year—not next month or next week—something like eight years into the drought, to people who are yet to be named to do things yet to be defined. We don't know what the Future Drought Fund is going to do. What we do know is that from that fund the government will draw down $100 million every year. That is a lot of money in everyone's language, but in these circumstances that money will not go very far. Indeed, if the government keeps to its commitment to spend this money by investing in innovation and technologies which help to build resilience on-farm, then none of this money will go to farming families. That's not what it's about. It's not a handout, or should not be a handout, to farming families as they have defined it. It's about building resilience on farm: innovation, regenerative agriculture, soil health, water efficiency, maybe plant science—all the things that will help our farmers defend against drought in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the reality is that, if the government is being honest, none of this $100 million is going to farmers per se—not directly, anyway. I hope and trust that farmers will benefit from a modest investment in the innovation we require to help them build defences against drought. But let us not pretend that from July next year there's going to be some additional assistance going directly to farmers, because if that's what happens the government will have misrepresented what the Future Drought Fund seeks to achieve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had the drought coordinator, the drought envoy, the drought task force and the drought summit. Now we have a drought minister, they tell us. Sadly, again, he declared to the nation yesterday on national television that he doesn't believe in the link between climate change and human activity. But the very foundation to a comprehensive drought policy is an acceptance of that fact. What hope does the Australian community have—and I quoted the percentage of people who are crying out for us to act—when their drought minister denies the connection between our activity and what is happening in our natural environment and with our climate?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People say to me, 'What would you do?' Well, what I can't do or what Labor can't do is rewind the clock. We don't have a time machine. We can't make up for the six years we've now lost since this government walked away from the COAG process and the plans COAG had developed for the further progression of a new approach to drought policy. Back in 2012, something historic happened: Australian governments agreed that the current suite of policies were not working, were counterproductive and were expensive, and that we needed a new approach. COAG was charged, having agreed to rip up the old framework, with progressing a new framework. Sadly, as one of the its first acts after the 2013 election, this government abolished the COAG committee. It abolished the body which was given responsibility to develop a new drought policy. Here we are, six years on, and we've got a potpourri of initiatives. There is a focus on initiatives that carry a big price tag, like the Future Drought Fund at $5 billion. It sounds fantastic, but the government never, instead of saying 'We've got a $5 billion fund,' says, 'We're going to spend $100 million out of this fund every year,' and neither does it define what it's going to do with it or who it's going to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What else do we have? We've got a failed farm household allowance framework, as I said. I will give credit where credit's due and I've done it before. The government has made some changes to capital depreciation schedules, which incentivises farmers to invest more in food storage, fencing and water efficiency projects. That is a good thing. The only problem is that you can't invest if you've got no cash. And you can't offset your investment if you don't have any profit. That has to be part of the mix, but it's not helping the most desperate of farmers in our country. Now, while I'm giving credit, I will acknowledge that I finally heard the Prime Minister, at the bush summit in Dubbo, say something about the storage of carbon in our soils. That's a shift in language from him; I've never heard him say that before. Sadly, I haven't heard him say it since either, and I appeal to him to say it more often.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said on national radio this morning, the opposition still stands ready to work on a bipartisan basis with this government to do the four things we need to do this job properly. We've got to tackle mitigation and, to tackle mitigation, you have to push aside the denial. We appeal to the government to do so. We've got to accelerate and progress adaptation for those on the land and those not on the land, whether it's the way we use our water at home or the way we use our water on the land. On the land it's about the way we treat our soils and the farming methods we use on a daily basis. They need to be the most efficient and the most sustainable in the world because we do farm and live in the driest inhabited continent in the world. We have terrible water scarcity and we've got to be smarter about how we use it. All of us do. The third point, of course, is the income support system. I have spoken about that. And the fourth is water infrastructure. This is the government that would have had you believe six years ago that they were going to build a dam a week. A dam a week is the way in which you'd interpret the language. I said at the time that the member for New England will never build a dam, and he never did and probably now never will.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Water infrastructure is my preferred term because water infrastructure doesn't necessarily mean dams. Some dams will work and some will not. Some will stack up environmentally and some will not. Some will stack up economically and some will not. But the last government to build dams and water infrastructure in this country was a federal Labor government in partnership with the states. This government, after six years, is yet to turn a sod, so what will we do? We can't get the six years back, but there's a four-point plan. It's pretty obvious, and we can't waste another day. These amendments and these bills are welcome, but they don't go far enough. No approach in this area of public policy goes far enough, and no approach will go far enough until this government accepts the link between human activity and climate change and finally gets around to doing something about it—an energy policy and a drought policy that will help our farmers in our rural communities get through the terrible time they are currently facing.</span>

I am quite delighted to be able to speak on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2019 and the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Amendment Bill 2019 before us. At the start I want to say that I join with the member for Hunter in his comments, particularly the need to make sure that Australia meets its Paris target commitments and the important role that carbon capture can play in meeting those targets. But, of course, as the member for Hunter also highlighted, it's important to note the complete lack of government policy in relation to making sure that we meet those Paris targets, and that is very, very disappointing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite that lack of policy direction coming from government, fortunately, what we are seeing is business moving itself toward this end, because business sees that this is not only in its economic interest but also in the interest of all of us who want to continue to live on this planet. Of course, they realise what it appears some members of the government's frontbench clearly don't realise, which is that there is a human role being played in the climate change that we are experiencing on this planet. We can see the lack of regard the government has not only for climate change in general, and the need to make sure that we have solid policy settings to meet the Paris targets, but also for this legislation. How many members do we have from the government speaking to this legislation in this debate? None. It is only the Labor side that is acknowledging the importance of this legislation in this debate today and it is gravely disappointing that we're not seeing any speakers at all from the government side.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge that my home state of Western Australia is the home of a well-established and reliable LNG export and supply industry for natural gas. Indeed, some of our projects are the biggest in the world. The bills before us today seek to transfer regulatory oversight of offshore greenhouse gas storage wells from the responsible Commonwealth minister to the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, NOPSEMA. Fundamentally, that means that these bills will help ensure that Australia has the safest and most environmentally responsible methods for pursuing carbon capture and storage in our offshore oil and gas fields. In practice, this would add to NOPSEMA's current portfolio of responsibilities the management of the environmental impact of offshore gas wells alongside its current responsibility for the management and good operation of those other gas and petroleum activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Carbon storage operates by taking carbon dioxide from industrial processes, including, of course, gas extraction, and pumping it underground to be stored at high pressure. Such injections can be as deep as two kilometres below the seabed. Carbon capture and storage is widely recognised as one of the key strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The International Energy Agency estimates carbon capture and storage could remove up to 85 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions from power production.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are more than 40 carbon storage projects operating around the world, and here in Australia we have possibly the most significant of those. The world's largest carbon capture and storage project is now operating on Barrow Island in my home state of WA. The Gorgon Project is a joint venture between Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell, and is a mere glimpse into what we have the capacity to do in this country to contribute to meeting our carbon emission targets. And there are more projects in the works around Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Workers on these offshore carbon-capture storage facilities, like with all offshore facilities, work in potentially dangerous conditions, and that brings me to the bills that are in front of us today. These bills will empower NOPSEMA inspectors to determine whether the regulated entities are complying with their obligations. Key amendments to this legislation are necessary to support and effect the transfer of regulatory functions and powers for the environmental management of offshore greenhouse-gas storage sites to NOPSEMA to ensure that it has a comprehensive set of powers to inspect and regulate offshore petroleum operations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps most notably, this bill proposes a number of amendments to strengthen NOPSEMA's ability as a regulator to monitor, investigate and enforce breaches on offshore oil and gas operations, with the intention of keeping workers and the environment safe and healthy. These changes are in response to issues that NOPSEMA itself has identified in undertaking its vital compliance monitoring operations to make sure that they have adequate and appropriate powers to enforce compliance in these high-hazard areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills propose an extension to NOPSEMA's ability to enter premises without warrant. They will empower NOPSEMA to undertake monitoring inspections of titleholders without warrant in relation to their safety as well as in relation to the company's environmental obligations. Currently, they don't require a warrant to enter the premises of a titleholder in relation to an investigation. However, now these same entitlements and powers will be extended to related entities such as contractors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills seek to strengthen and clarify the powers of NOPSEMA inspectors to monitor and enforce compliance on offshore rigs. This means they can inspect without warrant the premises of contractors working for titleholder entities and the premises of entities who've agreed to supply oil spill equipment. This is due to the fact that many contractors are the ones that actually hold the information that is vital to investigations that take place in respect of these facilities and respond in emergency situations. The more entities that NOPSEMA is able to secure this access for, the greater its ability to respond effectively as a regulator. Labor believes that these amendments will significantly increase the safety of workers and improve environmental outcomes in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, these bills provide NOPSEMA with the ability to conduct integrity inspections of wells without warrant, so that they can be undertaken promptly on an as-needs basis. The bills also provide the regulator with the ability to order enforceable undertakings where it detects a breach. This is intended to both unclog the court systems and enable a more tailored approach to regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Offshore rigs are a unique beast. They should be managed and cared for by the organisations and regulatory systems that best understand them. This is why enforceable undertakings are a sensible and appropriate response to some breaches. However, as has been highlighted in the banking and financial sector, this approach will not always be appropriate. An enforceable undertaking may be used in response to breaches in a manner that is proportional to the breach. An enforcement officer, such as an inspector, can readily make these assessments to respond in a timely and appropriate fashion. But it is not inappropriate for enforceable undertakings to be issued as a remedy in relation to the most serious of breaches.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments before us today outline the circumstances in which these enforceable undertakings will not be applied—situations in which the contravention is connected to a facility, contraventions involving reckless conduct, where the contravener has had a conviction for work-related fatality in the last five years or where the contravener has had more than two prior convictions from separate investigations over the last decade. This legislation should make it easier for NOPSEMA to do its job—to look after the environment and the staff who do dangerous work each and every day. In the context of a high-hazard industry such as this, noncompliance can literally be the difference between life and death or environmental disaster. This legislation makes positive steps to enforcing compliance to avoid such outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 of the bill includes amendments to enable a NOPSEMA inspector to take possession of a document or item if deemed necessary in an inspection. In the context of this high-hazard industry, compliance can be expensive, but noncompliance, as I mentioned before, could cost much more than merely dollars.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill states that the defendant in cases of liability will bear an evidential burden in relation to the question as to whether there has been fault in the form of a failure to comply with a regulation or direction. I can tell you now, as a former federal prosecutor, that I can attest to the necessity and benefit of these enhancements that will be provided to NOPSEMA as the regulator.</span>

The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2019 contains important measures which make amendments to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006. The miscellaneous amendments bill will transfer regulatory oversight for offshore greenhouse storage, environmental management and well operations from the responsible Commonwealth minister to the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, or NOPSEMA. The amendments in the miscellaneous amendments bill will also strengthen and clarify the powers of NOPSEMA inspectors to determine whether regulated entities are compliant with their obligations under the act and associated regulations. The bill further amends the act to introduce enforceable undertakings. The bill also makes technical amendments to the act to futureproof specific references in provisions of the act to regulations made under the act.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Amendment Bill 2019 amends the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Act 2003 as a consequence of related amendments to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006. NOPSEMA operates on a fully cost-recovered basis through levies and fees payable by the offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage industries. This includes well related levies imposed in relation to petroleum titles. To ensure NOPSEMA can also recover the cost of its oversight of well operations under greenhouse gas titles, this bill amends the levies act to extend the application of the well related levies to greenhouse gas wells. I commend these bills to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:56</span>):  I rise to contribute to the cognate debate on the Higher Education Support (Charges) Bill 2019 and the Higher Education Support Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2019. These bills introduce a range of small cost-recovery measures originally proposed in the 2017-18 budget. There will be a small annual charge for higher education providers and universities to support the cost of administering the Higher Education Loan Program. The bills also amend the Higher Education Support Act to introduce an application fee for higher education providers to offer FEE-HELP loans to Australian students. I also note that the new charges will have to comply with the Australian Government Cost Recovery Guidelines. The government has revised the impact of these charges, with $11.4 million in savings over the forward estimates. These are modest charges and go towards the administrative costs of Australia's world-famous income-contingent loan scheme, HELP, the Higher Education Loan Program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will not oppose these bills, because, on balance, these charges will have a very small impact on the higher education sector, especially in the context of our very positive policies for higher education. However, we won't tolerate a situation where these costs, modest though they are, might be passed on to students. We will continue to monitor the operation of the scheme and, if needed, seek future amendments, changes to regulations or assurances from the higher education sector. Even though overall this is a small extra impost, we believe that it should be absorbed by the higher education sector and not flow on to students and further undermine the equity and participation rates in our higher education system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge that a great deal of the anxiety that's been expressed by the university sector in relation to these bills—but much more broadly as well—is in relation to the track record of six years of cuts, chaos and dysfunction from this Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government. Since the Liberals came to office, universities have undergone a sustained period of attack, with cuts and chaos. In last year's MYEFO we saw the Minister for Education announce a cut of $134.8 million from the Research Support Program to fund unexplained projects in regional university campuses—unexplained projects that, without more information than we have been given, can look only like pork-barrelling. A majority of this funding is going towards repairing the damage caused by previous Liberal cuts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Liberal and National parties together came in and cut the funding. There's especially chaos in the regional university campuses, and it is something that, perhaps, the Nationals or the Liberal-National Party should be especially ashamed about. I note the minister at the table has universities in the electorate of Maranoa, such as the University of Southern Queensland. They'll be experiencing some of this hardship. The member for Capricornia has Central Queensland University in Rockhampton. The member for Flynn has Central Queensland University at Gladstone. The member for Hinkler has Central Queensland University at Bundaberg. The member for Dawson has Central Queensland University's Mackay campus and a bit of the James Cook University campus at Mackay as well. The member for Wide Bay has the University of the Sunshine Coast and the Gympie campus of the University of the Sunshine Coast as well. I'm particularly pointing out where the Nationals have let down higher education in their own areas. We've seen a freeze in student numbers, with a $2.2 billion cut that is actually worsening the situation there. Then, to repair the localised chaos, we take money from research and put it into these regional campuses that are being so hard hit. It really is not the way to run a higher education system that relies on certainty and over-the-horizon-type investment decisions. You cannot trust this Morrison government when it comes to education, especially in our regional, rural and remote communities. The Nationals are asleep at the wheel when it comes to looking after the bush.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do acknowledge that in this period of cuts and uncertainty the sector sees the charges in these bills as unfortunate. I want to assure them that under Labor we're committed to providing certainty of funding and maintaining a respectful and consultative approach. So many people in the university sector remind me of the promise from the former member for Warringah right on the eve of the 2013 election. He said that universities under a Liberal government would experience a period of benign neglect. I think universities would now be praying for benign neglect, given what they've gone through over the last six years and as we commence our seventh year under the coalition government. It has not been benign neglect but malicious intent in a lot of the university changes that we've seen under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments. There have been repeated attempts to cut funding from the university sector. There have been repeated attacks on students, trying to get them to pay more for a university education and restricting access to a university education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was Labor that led the charge against these cuts in this parliament. The first Liberal education minister of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, Minister Pyne, tried twice to cut funding. Then, last year, Minister Birmingham also tried to cut funding to universities. There were some cuts that we were able to stop and there were some, because they didn't require legislation, that Labor could not prevent. We couldn't stop the $2.2 billion in cuts made at the end of 2017, because the minister was using existing powers in the Higher Education Support Act to reduce funding. This decision means that the government has effectively recapped undergraduate places in our universities and forced students to pay their debts off sooner by lowering the HELP repayment threshold to $45,000. The member for Sydney, the shadow minister for education and training, has described this decision as reckless and unfair, and it still is. It has locked thousands of students out of the opportunity of a university education and put enormous pressure on other young people having to repay their debts sooner, often at the same time as they're trying to start a family, buy a house and cover all those other expenses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Changes like this, sadly, disproportionately affect women. The ACTU have undertaken analysis that shows that 60 per cent of Australians with a HELP debt and a taxable income are women. Nearly twice as many women are affected as men. We've also learned from Universities Australia that the cap on places meant that around 10,000 places were not funded in the 2018 calendar year, and we expect that number to have increased this year. The Mitchell Institute's recent tertiary participation analysis says that because of the Morrison government's caps on university places, around 235,000 students could miss out on a university place by 2031. At this stage of the year, when so many students are anxiously studying—preparing in the lead-up to their end-of-year exams, having studied hard in years 11 and 12, and hoping to get place at university—it really does tug the heartstrings to think that over the next decade or so almost a quarter of a million young people, a quarter of a million Australians who would otherwise have a place in university, will miss out if the policies of this Morrison government continue. Kids who were prepared to study, work hard and invest their time and money through the HELP repayment scheme in getting a university education, which better equips them for the world of work, will miss out because of the policy decisions of this coalition government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decline in TAFE and apprenticeships is in some ways even worse than what I've just described. We've seen an extraordinary failure by this government when it comes to vocational education and training. We know that nine out of 10 jobs created in the future will actually need a post-secondary-school education, either TAFE or university, so we need to increase participation in both universities and our voc ed sector to make sure that our young people are prepared for the world of work, which is changing so very quickly. We need to boost participation, not attack it and cut it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals' record in this area is abysmal. If we continue down this path, we'll severely jeopardise this nation's future economic growth, undermine the opportunity of individual Australians to meet their full potential and, very importantly, compromise our ability as a nation to compete with the rest of the world, using the skills, knowledge, discovery and invention of our people—one of our greatest resources. Consequently, I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes that the Government has damaged the quality of Australia's world-class higher education system, having cut billions from universities by effectively capping undergraduate places and slashing research funding".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud of Labor's commitments to university funding that we took to the election. Returning to a demand-driven funding system to lift the caps on undergraduate places would have seen around 200,000 more Australians get a place at university over the next 12 years. Labor is committed to putting fairness back at the centre of our education system, to see more students who are the first in their family to go to university.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that around Australia right now there are bright and talented students, many of whom might want a university education, but opportunity to get that education is not evenly distributed across our towns, cities, suburbs and country areas. It makes no sense to me at all that a young person from the Moreton Bay region in Queensland is about five times less likely get a university education than someone who lives on the North Shore of Sydney. It is not because brains are unevenly distributed across our country; it is because opportunity is unevenly distributed across this great land. We need to continue working to support more students from outer suburbs and the country, Indigenous students, students with disabilities and people who are the first in their family to go to university, as I was—sorry, I should clarify that for the sake of my siblings. I was the first in my family to complete a degree, not the first to attend—sorry about that, Simon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">University students and workers in higher education are always better off under a Labor government. Labor is committed to a better and fairer funding approach. Universities will be more than able to meet the small charges in this bill. I thank universities, unions, student groups and other stakeholders for their submissions on this bill and look forward to listening to the universities—not only in Queensland but particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia, and at other universities that I encounter—to find out what their issues are, what their concerns are. I look forward to consulting them about this bill and other pieces of legislation in the future.</span>

                    <a href="74519" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GORMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:07</span>):  I second the amendment. I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2019, the Higher Education Support (Charges) Bill 2019 and the amendment moved by the member for Moreton. This legislation will allow the government to impose fees on universities for the administration of students' access to the Higher Education Loan Program. These changes are expected to save the Commonwealth just $11 million across the forward estimates—if they want a suggestion about what to do with that $11 million, I suggest they use it to fund the CapTel handsets program that they're closing in February of next year. These are relatively modest savings. The Labor Party won't oppose these bills, but, I'll be honest, I do feel uncomfortable supporting this legislation. I spent my life as a student activist campaigning for free education. I'm a passionate believer that you should have the most accessible education system possible, from the earliest years of early childhood education all the way through to lifelong learning. Sadly, here in Australia, we have the sixth-highest fees for tertiary education in the OECD. That is completely unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Education is the most transformative investment we make in our people. It's something we should do with pride. We should look at ways to put more money into our university sectors, not just do small cost-recovery matters here and there. I served on Curtin's University Council in 2005 when that university implemented fee deregulation and increases to HECS fees. Sadly, that deregulation and those increases in university fees have continued year after year. Australia's higher education system has become unaffordable for far too many.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some 15 years on from when I was at university, my brother, Joey, is now studying at the University of Western Australia. He is studying the hard science of biology; I only did the soft sciences, social science. For his undergraduate degree my brother has paid twice what I paid. That is completely unacceptable. In another 15 years my son, Leo, will be looking at his options for further study as he is, I hope, completing high school. I am really worried that the system we continue to defund and to increase fees for will be an even less accessible system than the one we have today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By the government's own admission, this is low-priority legislation. But it's low-priority legislation because we have a more serious vocational education and training and skills crisis in this country. I know the TAFEs in my electorate of Perth are crying out for more investment in capital infrastructure—in new, modern classrooms and the facilities they need to train the next generation of aged-care workers; to train the next camos for channels 7, 9 or 10 or, indeed, the public broadcasters, the ABC and SBS; to train people in how to work in fashion design; or to train those who work in our labs. They don't have the facilities that they need in TAFE. Again, the government admits this is low-priority legislation, but when it comes to TAFE and vocational education there are huge, urgent priorities. Six years since the government was elected in 2013, we have 140,000 fewer apprentices. There has been $3 billion cut out of vocational education. We've seen a decline in enrolments in vocational education over those six years; in fact, if you look at TAFE enrolments between 2013 and 2019 you'll see there are 24½ per cent fewer TAFE enrolments than there were when this government was elected. That's a pretty remarkable record for six years in government and one I would be absolutely ashamed of if I were on the other benches.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has other concerns in respect of this legislation, as the member for Moreton just outlined. The government's approach to the funding of the Australian higher education system is, in my view, mean. It doesn't appreciate the important role of universities in generating the next generation of academics and people in our workforce. Universities should be hubs of learning, research and innovation. I'm lucky to have Edith Cowan University in my electorate and the growing presence of Curtin University. The University of Western Australia is just across the road. And Perth is experiencing what has been described as a mini boom of construction of new inner-city student accommodation, something that is bringing much-needed life back into the heart of Perth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Universities broaden minds. They create new possibilities. They will create the next Australian discoveries that we can be proud of. I loved being at university. I loved it so much that I went and did three degrees. Our universities are fabulous places for people to learn, meet other people and continue to contribute to the Australian economy. I did spend some time at university—this probably won't surprise anyone here—protesting against some of the changes of the Howard government. I won't recreate the chants that we used to use, but eventually Johnny Howard did indeed go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm worried that these fees may be passed on to students. I spent that time fighting not just against increases to higher education contribution schemes but against parking fee increases, fee increases for the university gymnasium and other things, and I worry that these fees will get passed on to students. That situation would be unacceptable. We know that, even if these fees aren't directly passed on to students, the cost will be paid somewhere. It will come in reduced teaching and learning investment; it will come in decreased investment in equipment for students or in the never-ending deregulation of the long-term academic workforce we rely upon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, while students continue to pay that little bit more and that little bit more for their education, we see that they are having to start repaying their HECS debt earlier and earlier. Commencing on 1 July this year, people earning $45,000 are now required to begin repaying their HELP debt. This is asked of both graduates and those who are still completing their studies. While they're being asked to repay those debts, students are under huge financial pressure. Universities Australia conducted a survey in 2017, which was released in 2018, on the finances of students and how they manage their day-to-day expenses. It's very relevant for this debate, because ultimately we're talking about how students afford their education and how we as a Commonwealth, as a federal parliament, make sure that that education is properly funded. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One in seven students in this survey reported going without food and other necessities as they were continuing their studies. In the case of Indigenous students, the survey showed that one in four Indigenous students were going without food or other necessities while they were in a higher education institution. Three out of five students said that finances were a source of worry and anxiety. That was higher amongst low-SES students and higher again, with most anxiety and worry about finances, for regional students. If you have to move away from home, there is the cost of being in student accommodation and everything else that comes with being a regional student going to a campus that might not be in your home town, and then you still need to worry about your own personal finances. The survey also found that one in 10 students were deferring their studies because of financial pressures, and two in five students said that their paid work adversely affected their university performance. One in three students were reported as regularly missing university lectures or classes because of their need to work to stay in their studies. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not how it should be. We should have a university system where people can go and enjoy studying, where they can learn properly, where they can attend the classes they're paying thousands of dollars for, where they can participate fully in the tutorials which they're paying thousands of dollars for and, indeed, which this government also pays thousands of dollars for. The universities absorbing the costs that will be imposed on them as a result of this legislation will result in reduced university staffing and services, as I said earlier. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must acknowledge what the university sector itself has said about this bill. Universities Australia Chief Executive Catriona Jackson has described the government's approach to higher education funding as 'death by a thousand cuts'. That's the university sector's own description of this government's higher education policies. This piece of legislation is one of those thousand cuts. It's not building anything new and exciting for students. It's not making any investment in research. It's just one more fee. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Saturday marks six years of the coalition government. As I said before, over that time we've had a huge decrease in investment and participation in the vocational education and training space. Unfortunately, we've also seen an increase in the casualised workforce in our universities. Universities are making redundancies. Permanent and fixed term staff are facing the prospect of losing their jobs and being moved into more insecure and casual work. Analysis from the National Tertiary Education Union shows that approximately eight out of 10 full-time equivalent teaching-only jobs are casual. That is, we are saying that we don't value teaching as much as we value research. The reality for most of us who engage in the university sector is that yes, we're lucky to have bright academics who make sure that we're learning from fabulous pieces of thoroughly assessed research; but teaching and learning are equally important. If we continue to underfund our universities, we're going to continue to underfund that vital piece of teaching and learning that provides the workforce of the future that we so desperately need. Figures from the Department of Education and Training itself show that now less than half of all jobs in our university sector are permanent. That is a shocking statistic. Indeed, if you think about what this legislation does, it continues that trend of casualisation of our university workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What do universities do to fix the gap that this legislation leaves? What do they do? They turn to international students—a great export market. It's a fabulous thing that we share our universities with the world, and I'm so lucky that when I went to Curtin University about 25 per cent of the student cohort were international students. It provides so much richness to campus life and richness to the university and to the tax coffers as well—some $35 billion contribution to the Australian economy, supporting some 240,000 jobs across the country. But it shouldn't be a substitute for proper funding of our universities—just valuing them in and of themselves. The government must properly fund higher education and research in this country. I'm glad that we are properly scrutinising this legislation and making sure that students aren't disadvantaged by this policy. Indeed, in coming years, I hope that we do not have any reports of universities passing these costs on directly or indirectly to students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Moreton spoke earlier of the ultimate vision for higher education in this country. Indeed, Labor did take to the election a $10 billion plan for universities over the next decade to make sure that we invest in the capital infrastructure and invest in the academic and mental infrastructure that's needed to make sure that our universities remain some of the best in the world. Sadly, as I and many on this side have acknowledged, Labor did not win that election, but it doesn't mean that we should be any less a voice for proper funding of our universities and proper investment in student learning. I will leave my remarks there.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Water Resources, Drought, Rural Finance, Natural Disaster and Emergency Management</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  I take note of the comments that have been made by those opposite. But let me say: this is a responsible measure that will make sure there's a sustainable tertiary education system into the future. The member for Moreton quite rightly identified a number of regional universities, one of which has a posting in Stanthorpe, in my own electorate. And let me tell you that it is a strong and robust campus, particularly around wine and the creation of wine. But the investments by universities and government into regional Australia, particularly regional Queensland in my electorate and those surrounding it, is important, and this bill is around the sustainability of that. This is about making sure that we can do it in an affordable way without having to put an extra $340-odd billion worth of tax on the Australian people. This is responsible and measured and will ensure the sustainability of the university sector for generations to come. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:35</span>):  I rise to speak to the Migration Amendment (Streamlining Visa Processing) Bill 2009 and to foreshadow that I will be moving a second reading amendment to this bill. But let me be very clear, Labor strongly believes in preserving and enhancing the integrity of Australia's immigration system. This is a core responsibility of national government, something that cannot be neglected, under resourced or, even worse, contracted out. We must ensure that everyone who enters Australia, having been granted a visa to do so, meets the conditions of that visa and complies with eligibility criteria including health and security checks, checks which are in place for good reason—to maintain the safety of all of us. For this reason, we on this side will be supporting the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation presently before the House would amend the Migration Act so as to enable the minister to prescribe that certain groups of visa applicants be required to provide one or more personal identifiers—biometric data—in order to make a valid visa application. These biometrics include: fingerprints, facial images, audio or visual recordings and an iris scan or signature. Personal identifiers along with other traditionally recorded data, such as full names and dates of birth, help in verifying that a person is who they claim to be and, importantly, effectively connect that person to security, law enforcement and immigration information. These changes are intended to streamline the process which is already in place, where the data requirement may only be imposed after an application has been lodged. I do note that a substantially similar bill was introduced in the last parliament on 29 November 2018 but that bill, like quite a few others, was not brought on for debate and lapsed when the 45th Parliament was dissolved—hardly streamlining. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister's second reading speech to this bill sets out the history of the biometrics program, which began in a very limited sense in 2006 but was significantly expanded following the enactment of the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Biometrics Integrity) Act in 2015. This enabled the minister or indeed his department to cause to be collected personal identifiers for a range of purposes under the act. I note that the 2015 bill raised a number of issues which were required to be balanced by lawmakers in this place—not only national security and visa integrity but also critical questions of privacy and human rights. Labor raised a number of concerns in this regard then but, having raised them and seen them considered through parliamentary processes, did not oppose the legislation. This bill, through a new proposed subsection 46(2A) would require a person who is included in a prescribed class of visa applicants to be required to provide certain personal identifiers in a specified way for their visa application to be considered valid. And proposed subsection 46(2B) provides that the minister may, by legislative instrument, make the relevant determinations about the provision of personal identifiers. Such an instrument would be non-disallowable. But, importantly, these new provisions would not have the effect of expanding the class of persons who may have provided personal identifiers from that which currently is the case. This is a power the minister already has and a matter that this parliament has already and quite recently considered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are considering now really is already streamlining; although, again, we haven't rushed to secure this efficiency. The delay in bringing this legislation on for debate since last November is yet another marker of the disengagement by this government from its fundamental responsibilities—responsibilities that the Minister for Home Affairs talks about quite a lot but hasn't paid due attention to when it comes to discharging his legislative or indeed his administrative responsibilities. This is about streamlining through providing that the requirement for personal identifiers can be at the start of the application process. We accept that what the government is doing is for good reason in protecting applicants from identity fraud and, of course, in strengthening our border security and national security—shared aspirations across this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do note that the bill that was introduced in the previous parliament was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee and that that committee then recommended that the bill be passed. It's important to note that this bill, while re-introduced as a new proposed act, is no different in substantive terms from that which was introduced in the last parliament. It is also important that the same can be said of the explanatory memorandum. That is also in the same terms as that previously introduced and previously considered by the Senate committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I think about issues of national security in terms of our borders and the integrity and efficacy of our visa system, I remind members in the House and particularly members opposite, who don't seem particularly interested in talking about this, that next month a decision is to be made in respect of tenders to, in effect, privatise aspects of Australia's visa processing services. This is something which really is quite extraordinary. It is extraordinary that any Australian government would seek to contract out its obligation to determine entry into the country, let alone one so focused—rhetorically at any rate—on issues of border security and national security. It's extraordinary that this government won't speak about this—won't explain why it is going down this path, why the national interest is served by this process—much less seek to justify its decision-making in this place or to the wider community. I don't believe that the Minister for Home Affairs—and he will of course have an opportunity to correct the record if I'm wrong—has spoken about the visa privatisation proposal for more than two years. This is quite telling. It's also telling, of course, that the speakers list for this bill does not feature a single government member—not one—speaking to these important issues that the substantive bill is dealing with or these wider issues that go to the operation of our visa processing services and, indeed, the prospect of those services being privatised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is one thing that the Prime Minister and, indeed, the Minister for Immigration, the member for Banks, aren't speaking about this tender. They have recused themselves from the process due to their relationships with Mr Scott Briggs, and I make no criticism of them in this regard. This is the right thing to have done to ensure that conflicts of interest and perceived conflicts are avoided. That's the right thing to do. But it can't excuse the complete silence from the whole of government and, in particular, the Minister for Home Affairs. It can't. This is a billion-dollar decision that we are talking about. It carries far-reaching consequences: job losses, risk of data security breaches and risk to system integrity—visa fraud in particular. Further worker exploitation is also a likely consequence of a decision of this nature, and government members should be thinking about this in the context of this bill, which is intended to progress our shared goals to boost our security at the border. But they're silent too. They are silent on visa privatisation, its impacts and its consequences just as they are silent when it comes to this bill. And so I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">"whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And so, in considering the bill and this amendment, let's remember what's been happening when it comes to visa processing, which is a disaster under this government. Surely we can do better in this regard when it comes to boosting the integrity of our immigration system at large and making improvements to its functioning more generally? Both matter, of course.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Modern Australia has been built on immigration, and that's something that's often rightly celebrated in this place on all sides of politics. But we must acknowledge that these foundations are being undermined. They are being undermined at a number of levels. Administrative changes which have led to the creation of the Department of Home Affairs—a bit of empire-building on the part of the member for Dickson—have devalued the critical immigration function at a structural level but also, as we've seen, at a cultural level, when so many experienced officials have left the service. It has devalued the important role of immigration services and settlement support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are important questions, and the context is very, very significant. In 2017 to 2018 the Department of Home Affairs processed close to 8.7 million temporary visas—student, tourist and temporary worker visas amongst others—which was a significant increase on the previous year, and this volume is forecast to continue to increase to perhaps 13 million per annum by 2026-27. There were also a large number of permanent visas granted in that time—162,000 under the migration program as well as over 16,000 under the humanitarian program. On this side of the House we are deeply concerned about how this government is handling this ever-increasing demand on our immigration system in the context of neglected frontline services across the Department of Home Affairs, as it is now styled. We know that this is having a very significant impact on visa processing times. People are waiting longer to be reunited with family members or even to settle. Visa processing times are out of control under this government, and those applying for partner visas are now waiting for more than two years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have around 200,000 people on bridging visas in Australia. This is as eloquent an admission of failure on the part of this government as anything could possibly be. But what's the government doing about this? What's the government doing about successive ANAO reports? I've got to acknowledge my colleague the member for Bruce, who's highlighted the volume of visa processing delays and citizenship delays, which are also critically important. What he and members on this side of the House are concerned about is not just the statistics, shocking as they are, but the human stories that underpin them in a nation such as Australia—a nation built on immigration. These changes aren't measurable by statistics alone. They are shaping and diminishing individuals' lives, and they're diminishing all of us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And what's the government doing about it? Instead of properly funding the visa processing system and instead of respecting the wonderful women and men who work for the Department of Home Affairs, who work for all of us in the critical functions of supporting our immigration program and maintaining our border security and our national security—these people are treated with contempt. They're being treated with contempt as workers, as is the value of the work that they do on our behalf. And this is a disgrace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I put on the record my deep appreciation for those workers and my appreciation for the time that some of them have spent with me explaining the significance of the work they do, their pride in the work they do and their frustration that it is not properly acknowledged by a government that likes to talk about border security and the roles that it plays but that is not properly supporting them. Those workers should be supported. They should be acknowledged in the words of the minister and the government and, more fundamentally, in the deeds of the minister and the government. But, instead, we see the absolute opposite. Instead of properly supporting our visa processing system, the government is proposing to privatise the visa processing system. We know what this will result in because we've seen an experiment just like this in the United Kingdom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd encourage government members to acquaint themselves with what has happened since the UK government introduced the profit motive to this aspect of their immigration system. What we have seen is the ability of very wealthy individuals effectively to jump the queue. What we have seen is a downgrading of services for ordinary people, a devaluing of their experience and their engagement with the system and, indeed, their connection to their country. There have been a series of shocking revelations in the UK, which are causing great disquiet in their parliament—which, of course, has been dealing with a few other things at the moment—and across the UK media.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think people in Australia, a country to which immigration is so fundamentally important to how we are as a nation and to our economy, should look very carefully at what has happened in the UK and, at the same time, listen very carefully to those workers in Australia undertaking this work, because there are actually a few additional concerns above and beyond the prospect of the profit motive being introduced here. We are talking about the potential loss of 2,000 jobs—a number not of our creation but a feature of the government's own costings in the lead-up to the election. It was that side of politics over there, the members opposite, who put before the Australian people the prospect of sacking 2,000 public servants connected to this critical work. That's 2,000 jobs around the country—some in regional centres, where this will have an enormous impact, not only on the individuals and their families but also on the communities they live and work in. This is something that I urge government members to think about—think about supporting this second reading amendment and sending a message to those people that they are valued by some on the conservative side of politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that there are two tenders proceeding, one of which, as I noted earlier, is very closely associated with Mr Scott Briggs, a significant donor to the Liberal Party of New South Wales and the LNP in Queensland too. We've heard recent revelations by the journalist Michael West of other donors being connected to this. These are things which are very deeply concerning, above and beyond the prospect of job losses: the prospect of creating two tiers of access to our visa processing system, the prospect of data security breaches and the prospect of further worker exploitation. It seems odd to say that in an environment where we have nearly 200,000 people on bridging visas, where we see wage theft connected to that that is absolutely epidemic across the Australian economy. It is not only impacting those vulnerable people on bridging visas themselves but also spreading across the entire labour market—an issue that my colleague the shadow minister for home affairs has put squarely before the government and across the community, including a number of organisations that are not traditionally the closest of allies to the Australian Labor Party, like the National Farmers Federation, but in respect of which the government remains refusing to listen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, it is time for the government to clean up a mess that they have created—a mess that they have created by creating an empire for the member for Dickson, an empire which has devalued some fundamentally important functions. We are starting to see the consequences of that—economy-wide consequences and individual consequences. It's time to clean up the mess, not walk away good jobs and walk away from the national interest, and, most fundamentally, to do so without making the case for a decision. This is a billion-dollar tender—a billion-dollar tender going to fundamental functions of government—and yet they won't talk about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister will have an opportunity to sum up, and perhaps he might touch on the reasons, if he can find any, as to why he won't be supporting the second reading amendment, which puts squarely the Labor Party's view of how the national interest is to be served when it comes to visa processing. We support the substantive bill before the House because it is in the national interest to do so. We support and urge government members to support the second reading amendment because we know that visa privatisation is not in the national interest.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:53</span>):  I second the amendment. I'll make some initial comments on the bill itself and then turn my remarks to the second reading amendment moved by the member for Scullin. Suffice to say, the bill is largely fine. It is largely uncontroversial. It was introduced last year, but the government was so serious about the bill that they did nothing with it, like much of the legislation currently on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>—reheated seconds! Of course, Labor does support integrity and the formalisation, in some respects, because a lot of this already happens but without, perhaps, the clearer legislative underpinning of the extension of biometric data to be required at the time of application as being important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to put on the record and amplify a couple of the concerns that were raised in the Senate report—in particular, that regarding the provision for exemptions. The bill does not provide, in the way that similar provisions in the act seem to, for exemptions from this in certain circumstances. There has long been a policy and a set of provisions across most of the visa categories for waiver of these kinds of requirements in emergency or compassionate circumstances, as well as compelling circumstances in the national interest—heads of state, heads of government, that kind of thing. But the emergency bit goes to many of our constituents, because it's the daily fare in electorate offices that people ring you in a panic because, for example, someone might have had an accident, they might only have a few days to live, and the family want their relatives to come out and say goodbye, or someone has had a terrible accident and the family needs someone to come out and care for children. Those kinds of things are the stuff of daily life, and, being in such a multicultural area, I see many people in my office relying on family and friends from all around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill doesn't provide for these exemptions and the Senate committee pointed that out; government members raised those concerns, such as similar provisions being elsewhere in the act. I note the minister has stated, 'It's not intended the requirement apply to short-stay visas in emergency situations.' We have no further detail, so I'd invite the minister to repeat that commitment and perhaps explain to us how the government is actually going to provide that family members are able to quickly come to Australia and be with their loved ones—loved ones who have had fatal accidents, near-death experiences, all those other family emergencies—without always having to go through these ordinary checks. It is really important that this is true, because if it's not then the consequences at a human level would be very harsh indeed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I'd just note—it's not a particular, but it does relate to these requirements and the further we extend them—is the difficulty for many people in many countries to actually meet these requirements, and I'd draw particular attention to the Pacific Islands. I've had groups come to me struggling to complete the visa requirements and to do things in person. When they're from island countries, they often have to travel for many days to get to the visa office where they can do this. I'd encourage the government to be sensible in applying these to certain countries where the physical geography would prevent people from doing this. We had a problem in that regard with a Scout jamboree. The jamboree almost couldn't happen because they simply could not travel to the main island to get the visa requirements met. So I trust that there will be sensible exemptions provided for the minister or the department to administer these provisions, as occurs elsewhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to the second reading amendment, which goes, in essence, to the utter mismanagement of the visa and migration program under this government and, indeed, the current department administration. The blowout in visa waiting times is part of the context, as the member for Scullin has observed, and I'd just draw the House's attention to two in particular. My electorate is one of the most multicultural in the country. Our constituent workload is somewhat peculiar compared to most members' offices. Visa, immigration and citizenship issues account for more than half of the things that we deal with every day. They outrank all of Centrelink, all of disability and even all of the NBN. All those things combined are swamped by visa and citizenship issues, and that has been getting steadily worse in the more than three years that I've been in parliament, as this government continues to cut staff from the department and we continue to see blowouts in visa waiting times for every category.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll now just touch on the two issues that cause the most tears, the most problems, in the office. One is partner visas. There has been an appalling, a quite unbelievable, blowout in the average waiting time for partner visas, which I believe privatisation is only going to make worse. I want to put on the record: you cannot get longitudinal data for this. The government won't provide it; they hide it. You used to be able to get this stuff, but they scrub it from the website now—all they will do, at a point in time, is publish what they say is the 'average processing time' for 75 per cent and for 90 per cent of the applications—but we have managed to piece together some data.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For partner visas, this is usually an Australian citizen falling in love and marrying someone overseas. That's the stuff of our everyday life in Australia; it's part of our social fabric, and has been for decades. It has always been the case that you're able to bring someone you love to Australia. The waiting time for partner visas in 2016, according to an answer to a question, was about 15 to 18 months—okay; there you go. As of 30 June 2017, for subclass 801, it was 18 to 22 months. Then we get to 30 June 2018, which is 16 to 23 months, so pretty similar. The current waiting time has blown out to 21 to 28 months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've seen over the past four years has been a progressive increase. The human misery that causes is immense, cruel and doesn't actually stop people coming to the country. As the member for Scullin observed, the government's so-called cut to migration—this much trumpeted, 'We've cut migration; we've cut permanent migration to 160,000'—is a con, is a trick and is an absolute fraud. There are still people coming to the country, but they come on visitor visas and then they hang around for years on bridging visas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we have almost 200,000 people in this country on bridging visas. They often don't have work rights. Eventually they might get some Medicare rights out of the government in a limited way—if you're about to die we might let you see a doctor. But it doesn't actually save the taxpayer money. It still means they're catching the trains, driving on the roads, all that stuff. When we say we're busting congestion, somehow it's the fault of migrants that the roads are congested, not the government's failure to invest in infrastructure. This blowout in waiting times is coupled with this absolute fraud of the cut to migration. None of it is actually real. We just have people hanging around on other visas. They're not able to fall in love, marry and settle in the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I would like to draw the House's attention to is dependent child visas. This may sound esoteric. It's very hard to get any data on this, but in the last 12 months I've heard multiple cases of people, Australian citizens, who fell in love overseas, lived overseas and moved back to Australia. They want to bring their kids. It seems pretty reasonable. They're now waiting over 12 months to get the dependant child visa. It doesn't sound like a problem; they have the kids here on a visitor visa. But it is a problem, because they can't go to school. They cannot go to school without being charged international student fees. The kids are sitting at home. I had a family in Noble Park with kids sitting at home for six months. The family are terrified because they can't afford any more health insurance, and they think that if they leave the house and have an accident their kid might die. The department's response to this is that they will just have to wait, because until they get the permanent visa they can't have them attend school. This is unbelievable. This stuff goes on every day. It doesn't affect many members over there. You don't see it all in your electorates, but we do see it in many of the multicultural electorates over here. The human misery caused by the cuts to the Department of Home Affairs and the complete mismanagement is unbelievable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final bit of context that I would like to touch on is the blowout in citizenship waiting times. The Auditor-General tabled a report in February which found that over the last four years the waiting times have blown out by 771 per cent. When the Labor government left office there were about 30,000 people in the queue at any point in time. That was about normal. It took six to 12 months to get through, do the checks and do the test. Fine. As of 30 June last year, there were 244,765 people hanging around for years waiting for their citizenship. Again, you may think, 'What is the problem with that?' They're permanent residents of the country; they've been paying taxes; they've got a life here; but they are not able to consolidate their life. They are not able to get a passport in some cases, if they're humanitarian entrants, and travel. We've had students who need to complete their masters by doing a subject required as part of their degree in another country, who just sit here waiting for two years. We've had people not able to go to university because of the fee structure, because until they get their citizenship they're not eligible for a whole lot of stuff. Again, it's the complete mismanagement of this department. Unbelievably, part of the government's proposal is that after they've privatised the visa processing system there's a second stage, which is to privatise the citizenship-processing system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to call this out for what it is. It's an old conservative government playbook, straight out of the UK. It's failed, as the member for Scullin pointed out. First we cut. Since 2016-17 this government has cut $180 million in funding from the Department of Home Affairs, and thousands of staff. First we cut; then we create a crisis; then we say: 'Look at those terrible public servants. They're not processing the visas. The only way to fix the crisis is to privatise. That's the answer.' So right now there's a $1 billion tender being considered, sitting in the department, sitting with ministers. Some of the ministers have to recuse themselves, as the member for Scullin said, because their Liberal Party mates are the tenderers. Thousands of jobs would be cut from Home Affairs, and these profitable contracts would be given to Liberal Party mates to process the applications to determine who comes into this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But if there's one thing that should be done by public servants in the public interest in a department of state, surely it's the assessment and processing of visa and citizenship applications. It determines who comes to our country. It determines who can stay in the country. It's extremely private information. We know it's private and commercially valuable because both of the consortiums of the tenderers have travel insurance agents and health insurers. You can imagine it: you start filling out the form; you say, 'I'm going to stay for 12 months'; and the ads start popping up, because they're sucking your data into private companies just for dealing with the government. I can't wait for the privatisation of Centrelink. They've already started that. That's another debate. There are 5,000 staff out now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will tell us that we have to do it for better service at lower cost. It's true that we need better service. As I said, the department is completely broken. The staff satisfaction surveys came out a few weeks ago across 75 public sector agencies in the Commonwealth. Guess which one was number 75? The Department of Home Affairs. Morale in that department, under this minister with his dark heart and the secretary, master of the dark arts in the bureaucracy, is at abysmal lows. It is the worst place to work in the Commonwealth. That is absolutely appalling. This is an important department of state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It wasn't like that before this leadership. The government has cut so many staff that the backlogs grow and the kids of Australian citizens are sitting at home not even able to start school. In desperation, I referred one of these cases to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span> in January—I couldn't get any sense out of anyone else. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span> said: 'Yes, that's terrible. We'll help you.' They went to do a story and then they rang the department. The department's media person said: 'Thank God! This is terrible. Maybe you guys can get some action. We get these calls all the time.' Still, not much happened. Eventually we did get the kids to a school. I thank the Greek Orthodox school in Oakleigh, which gave them half fees, and that is still going well. It was a really good solution. Thank you to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, this is straight out of the failed conservative playbook. They cut the service to create a crisis. This is my prediction: firstly, the private operator will be a government mate and they'll introduce two fee scales. There will be higher fees for those who can pay for a premium service and sail through, and other fees for most Australians, like the people in my electorate, who are told by the Liberals to suck it up harder and wait. Then, over time, once the capability of the public service has been destroyed—this is a really important part of what they try to do: they destroy the in-house capability. We've seen it with employment programs. There's no-one left in the department that knows anything about an employment program. They just administer contracts to pay billions of dollars to private companies that get no-one a job. Secondly, once the capability in the public sector has been destroyed, the prices start rising, like we saw in the UK, because the private sector contractors have a monopoly by then. It's hard to the point of impossible for anyone else to compete. Then there'd be too many up-front costs to the government to later go, 'Well, we got this wrong,' and insource it, like we're seeing in the UK, and the taxpayer gets royally screwed for decades. Thirdly, you can bet your bottom dollar the private operator will donate generously to the Liberal Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My concern about the future service model is, firstly, that it was publicly reported that in industry briefings to tenderers the department noted the potential for offsetting the cost of building a new online platform by providing premium services. This is their plan! No wonder the minister won't come in here to actually talk about his billion-dollar tender to give the department to his Liberal Party mates. No wonder he doesn't want to talk about that. I know, and every member opposite knows, the response you'd get if you went into your electorate and said, 'Hey, we think we might privatise the processing of visas and immigration and citizenship—is that a good idea?' Punters in Australia know exactly what privatisation of these public services delivers. They've seen this in electricity and in gas in Victoria. They see it in Centrelink now, where no-one will answer the phone. They know what's going to happen if you get away with this. That is public-service-speak in that tenderer briefing for offering two different processing streams based on how much applicants are prepared to cough up. Of course, a private operator will follow the incentive—as they should. They're going to chase the higher profits. That's what they'll do. They'll chase the higher profits on the high-service fees and the premium visas and everyone else will wait at the bottom of the queue. This undermines the integrity of the migration program and creates a two-class system which is roundly un-Australian and should be rejected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I encourage the government members, the few amongst them who may be prepared to think: have a look at Britain. The Conservative MPs are freaking out about what a mess they've made of this. They're looking at bringing some of this stuff back in-house. Insourcing is now a debate. The company Carillion collapsed in a billion-dollar tender, leaving the government with a mess of hospitals, prisons and services. And then they decided it was too big to fail, so guess who bailed it out? The poor old taxpayer steps in and pays more than if they'd just run the services properly themselves. The government has to abandon their plans to privatise visa and citizenship processing. If they don't, then at least have the courage, the guts and the decency—find a shred of honesty—to come in here and explain what you're doing. Be up-front about it instead of hiding from public scrutiny.</span>

This bill enables the collection of personal identifiers to be a prerequisite to making a valid visa application. It supports the electronic lodgement of visa applications and efficient visa processing by the Department of Home Affairs. It also enhances the integrity of Australia's visa programs and helps to protect Australians from persons who are a criminal threat or a risk to national security. In summary, I believe that the bill deserves the support of all members, and I commend the bill to the House.</span>

I am the acting co-chair of the foundation, as Jason Clare, the member for Blaxland, is on sick leave. It has the full-throttle support of both sides of parliament.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning the member for Leichhardt and I had our PSA tests done jointly, in the same booth, to provide the level of bipartisan support necessary to lift the importance of testing and to remind men of the importance of prostate cancer testing, particularly for men over 50. The member for Leichhardt was kind enough to point out that I have a few years to go before I'm 50. Nevertheless, I've done the test. It's a good idea to have the test done even if you still have a four at the front of your age, as I do, but it's particularly important for men 50 and above to have the test.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know this is not directly germane to the bill before the House, but it is health related. We should take every opportunity to lift the profile of prostate cancer, as every honourable member here does regularly. I would encourage honourable members, as I am doing, to hold their own Big Aussie Barbie in their electorates. I'm doing it in a week or so. I'm holding a big barbecue in St Clair in my electorate, and all the residents of St Clair and Erskine Park and environs are very welcome to come to that barbecue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition supports the legislation before the House. It is a sensible updating of the arrangements for pharmaceutical benefits. We have been engaged with the government on the process which led to the bill before the House, so of course it will receive our support. The National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2019 makes two relatively minor changes to the supply of medicines. It's well over a year since the 2018 budget was delivered, but the first change in this bill implements a measure from that budget, which is to recover the costs of the pharmacy approvals process. As many members know, applications to open or relocate pharmacies are assessed by the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority, which makes recommendations to the minister's delegate. Under the bill before us, the cost of this process will be recovered from applicants. I note that this cost recovery was due to begin on 1 July 2019 but it wasn't listed in parliament in time. While that occurred, taxpayers continued to foot the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the second change, the bill aims to continue supply for PBS medicines following bankruptcy or external administration of pharmacies. The bill sets out a framework to allow the Secretary of the Department of Health to grant and revoke permission to a trustee to supply PBS medicines at a location where the approved pharmacist is bankrupt. The government says this will ensure access to pharmaceutical benefits to an affected pharmacy is not compromised in the meantime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have consulted pharmacists, the Pharmacy Guild and associated bodies, and we will support this bill. It is a sensible change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of other barriers to accessing medicines in Australia that are not addressed by this bill, including PBS listings. I note that there are 60 medicines recommended by the PBAC currently which have not been listed by the minister, including Symdeko, which is an important drug for cystic fibrosis treatment. Symdeko should be listed by the minister. The minister said he would. Of course there are 59 other drugs which are not listed by the minister despite the fact the PBAC has recommended that they should be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Waiting lists have never been higher and out-of-pocket costs have never been higher than under this government. It's important the government recognise that and take action. One of the things they can do to address out-of-pocket costs for people suffering various conditions is to list the medicines that have been approved by the PBAC. That could improve the situation. The minister likes to say that when the PBAC recommends a pharmaceutical to the minister, he acts on it. Well, he doesn't. He doesn't always act on it. Sixty medicines have been recommended to the minister. Accordingly, I foreshadow that I will be moving a second reading amendment to this bill. That will give the House the opportunity to express the view to the minister that he should do better. Pharmaceutical listings are not about a Sunday media event at every opportunity; they are about giving relief to Australians who need it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I visited Jordan and Tracy. Jordan is a sufferer of cystic fibrosis and so are two of his siblings. Three out of four children in the family suffer from cystic fibrosis. Symdeko would not be a suitable medicine for each of them, but it would be for at least one of them. The massive improvement in his quality of life that would result from having Symdeko available to him and the extension, potentially, in his life span of up to 20 years are not things to be disregarded by the minister. But so far it has been disregarded by the minister, despite the very clear recommendation from the PBAC to list Symdeko for sufferers of cystic fibrosis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other honourable members will have other examples of constituents in their electorates who are suffering from cystic fibrosis who may benefit from Symdeko, who at least should have the option, based on the very best clinical advice to them, to seek advice as to whether Symdeko would be suitable for them, but they just simply can't afford it. The cost is astronomical for families. There would be very few families in Australia who could afford Symdeko. This is, as I said, one more example of a drug which has failed to be listed by the minister. Accordingly, I move:</span>

However, the work we're doing on the PBS, bringing new medicines onto the scheme each and every month, is something the federal government are exceptionally proud of. The opportunity for us to have this structure has been put together in a bipartisan way. Both sides of politics have had a hand in developing the PBS to make it assume this role within Australian society. Our drug companies are given the opportunity to go away and develop, and to introduce new drugs onto the market that are going to find a way to make lives better for people who have a whole raft of ailments.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, over a period of time, these subsidies are taken away and generics have the opportunity to flood the market at a much more affordable price. But in that time where these drugs are put on the market for exorbitant amounts, it is with the recommendation of the board that these drugs are put onto the PBS. So we're very proud of the work that we have done and we plan to continue with this work. Adding extra billions of dollars to most of our budgets in the last few years has seen billions of dollars added to the PBS to ensure that more and more drugs are going to be able to be put on the market—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to a larger-than-life Tasmanian who unfortunately died on 21 August, Brian Inder. Brian was born on 12 December 1930 in Manly, New South Wales, but he became a legend of north-west Tasmania. He was a champion of Tasmania's tourism industry. He was best known for establishing Tasmazia and the Village of Lower Crackpot, which is a miniature village full of quite wonderful little houses and buildings. He was also the driving force behind Mural Fest in the town of Sheffield; he was the brains behind the Edge of the World at Arthur River; and he was a champion of the Mount Roland cableway right up to the day of his death. The cableway is an exciting possibility for the Kentish region. Although there's a lot of work to be done to ensure that this project meets community expectations, I cannot help but think that bringing the spectacular vista of Mount Roland to so many would be a wonderful legacy for Brian Inder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Brian was a very well-deserved 2005 Tasmanian Tourism Champion. I had the pleasure of sitting down with him last year to talk about his plans for the cableway. He was always thinking outside the box, and he had a sense of fun and irreverence all the way through. It was a great send-off in Sheffield the other week, and he will be much missed. Vale, Brian Inder.</span>

As a result of their training and experience, veterans are extremely resilient and are creative problem solvers, and have exceptional work ethics and the priceless virtues of reliability and integrity. However, for some veterans, leaving the ADF and adjusting to mainstream life can be difficult.

Working Spirit arranges meet and greets, where veterans have one-on-one interviews with employers. They conduct networking events, where veterans meet corporate executives and get professional assistance with their LinkedIn profiles and resumes. Working Spirit also arranges professional internships, and has started the Women Veteran Employment Network. The results are extremely impressive. Seventy-six veterans have found employment and hundreds have benefited from attending events. In recognition of her work, Karyn has been a finalist for the Women in Defence Awards and is a current finalist in the Defence Industry Awards.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  NBN infrastructure is crucial for families and businesses in WA and across Australia. It's crucial for sustaining the jobs of the future and for essential services in education and health. Western Australia is the largest and most remote state, separated from the rest of the country by enormous distance and by time difference. We need competitive and high-quality broadband connectivity to bridge those gaps. We deserve NBN services that are on par with those in the rest of Australia. But that is not what we're getting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In last month's <span style="font-style:italic;">Measuring broadband Australia</span> report, the ACCC picked out Western Australia as having the worst broadband of any state. We have the highest proportion of underperforming broadband services of any state. We have the slowest average busy-hour download speeds. There's no great mystery as to how that occurred. Thanks to this Liberal government, WA has been lumped with the largest share of the worst NBN technology. We've got half as much again of the old copper line rubbish as the other states. And, surprise, surprise: our NBN performance is at the bottom of the pile. It means WA sits well below the government's own benchmark, which requires 90 per cent of premises to get to 50 megabits per second. Somehow, this Liberal government didn't have the nous to ensure that that benchmark was achieved fairly and evenly across Australia. What does it mean? It means one in seven premises in WA won't receive fast broadband, whereas in New South Wales it's fewer than one in 10. It's the definition of a digital divide. It makes WA a broadband backwater.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  Some may say there's a fair bit of bull in this place, but not as much as in the recent Youth Bull Riders World Finals, which were held in the United States in late August. I'd like to congratulate 11-year-old Levi Ward, who not only qualified for the world finals but took out second place in the under 11 division. This young fellow from Kundabung just outside Kempsey is no stranger to success. Last year he placed 11th in the world finals. He has continued his excellent form in 2019 and is the current leader of the Australian Bushmen's Campdraft and Rodeo Association eight to under 11 steer-riding and barrel race as well as the under-18 all-round junior cowboy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In celebrating his success, we can't forget his proud parents Tash and Dean Ward, and the huge commitment they've made to get Levi to and from his rodeos and meets and to encourage him to world title success. But domestic and international travel isn't cheap, though, so I encourage any business, community group or organisation to help Levi chase his dreams. And chase his dreams he does. Looking up to his hero Pete Farley, another world champion bull rider from Kempsey, Levi is intent on returning to Texas next year and he's hoping for third-time lucky and to take out the world title. Once again, I congratulate him for his success so far. I'm sure there will be much more to come, and that's no bull!</span>

The Certificate II in Autonomous Workplace Operations will be introduced to the South Metropolitan TAFE curriculum and piloted by a group from the Rio Tinto iron ore workforce from later this year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am especially proud to share that this program will be piloted for year 11 and 12 students in selected high schools across the state, including Burt's own Cecil Andrews College. Over the last few years as a federal MP, I have had the opportunity to observe the fantastic work of Cecil Andrews College in my electorate, which is leading the way in STEM education. They're the only P-TECH school in WA and have had some fantastic success nationally, competing in robotics competitions as well as leading the way in direct industry engagement at a high-school level. It's programs like these that will train the next generation of miners and explorers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These new certificate courses will be the first to provide education pathways to jobs in autonomous operations. As the shadow minister for WA resources, I can't wait to see how these talented students will help shape the future of the mining and other resources industries in Western Australia. They continue to be at the forefront of training and innovation in our nation. I look further to working closely with the South Metropolitan TAFE, Cecil Andrews College and Rio Tinto on this exciting new educational endeavour, which will benefit our whole community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  In March this year, I was proud to be with the Deputy Prime Minister and with my friend the member for Capricornia to open the new Mackay Aquatic and Recreation Complex. This new $24-million athletics and aquatics centre was made possible due to almost $10 million in funding from the Liberal-National government and $13.8 million from Mackay Regional Council.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The state-of-the-art facility was built to international standards and last week played host to the 2019 Oceania Masters Athletics Championships. This was a big first test for the facility, and it received glowing reports. The seven-day competition enabled those aged 30 and over to continue participating in competitive athletic events, with the oldest competitor being a sprightly 93 years of age. The championships attracted more than 450 athletes and officials from 18 different countries, bringing about 1,000 visitors into the region. The member for Capricornia will be pleased to know that brings economic advantage to the region, and that's why we put the money into it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to congratulate Oceania Athletics, Athletics North Queensland and the Mackay Athletics Club for organising the event. Huge credit goes to the Mackay Regional Council and its mayor for continuing to attract prestigious sporting events to the region. I give a special mention to: James and Jos Grech from Mackay Athletics Club, as the heads of the local organising committee; staff at Belgravia Leisure; and everyone at Mackay Athletics who volunteered to make this event such a huge success—a boost to the economy that showcases the region as a region that's capable of holding bigger and better events.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  Last Wednesday, 4 September, I attended the formal presentation at the Tea Tree Gully RSL sub-branch of the RSL Anzac of the Year 2019 award to Jeffrey Yates OAM. The citation in support of his nomination read, in part:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Jeffrey Wayne Yates served in the Australian Defence Force as a Signals Officer for more than 21 years. He saw operational service in Cambodia in 1993, where his unit was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation. In the Australia Day Honours of 1990, he was awarded an Order of Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Throughout his years of service, he was a mentor to hundreds of soldiers and officers across a wide range of regimental postings. That experience would hold him in good stead for retirement. During his service life, he recognised that soldiers broken in service were looking for help in seeking compensation for injuries sustained during that service. That led to his commitment to help them, and the best way he could do that was to become an advocate.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">During his time as an advocate he has worked tirelessly helping hundreds of service and ex-service personnel, submitting claims on their behalf, as well as working for those seeking war widow status. He represents them at the Veterans' Review Board and gives advice and assistance to the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jeffrey Yates is a worthy recipient of the 2019 Anzac of the Year award. I congratulate him on his well-deserved recognition and I thank him for his service.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  Recently, I met with Jim Mehmet, the owner-operator of Southern Cross Orchards. Southern Cross Orchards is a stone fruit growing business, which encompasses 500 acres of stone fruit across 10 properties in the Goulburn Valley. Jim raised the issue of the lack of labour available to harvest their crops. Last year, this problem led to them leaving about 100 tonnes of fruit on the trees, simply because they didn't have the labour force needed to take those crops off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Victorian State Labor Government has introduced a labour hire law which means that every labour hire company will need to be registered and every farmer that employs directly will also have to be registered. This has the capacity to take even more of the workforce that is available away from the employers that need them to get the crops off. This has been done under the guise of somehow or other trying to stop the exploitation of workers. What will really happen is that, because of the effect on thousands of people who are currently working in the fruit industries around the Goulburn Valley, up into the southern Riverina and over towards Sunraysia, some of our highest value commodities are going to have fruit left on the trees, simply because the Labor Party in Victoria doesn't understand what it is doing to the workforce that is being used to get these crops off for our farmers.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  Good things happen in Mayo! I recently met with a group of students at Encounter Lutheran College in Victor Harbor. Those students give up their lunchtime to make their school and our world a better place. They call themselves CREST Earth—with 'CREST' standing for Catalyst, Research, Enrichment, Scope and Transformation—and they're from years 5 to 11.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I attended a presentation of their work recently. They were telling me about their projects, which include organising kitchen caddies for each classroom so that green organic waste can go into composting bins, and they've established worm farms; labelling all the school bins so students can sort their rubbish; growing their own herbs and vegetables to supply the school cafe with fresh produce; and plans for a beach clean-up. They're keen to create a multipurpose drinking fountain in their school and are participating in Nude Food October with lunch boxes, so they can cut down on plastic waste.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is real action in their school community and in our wider community about making our world a better place. They are leaders in our community, even though they are so young. I commend them for the great work they do, and I look forward to joining the students from CREST Earth for their beach clean-up.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  This weekend Cannon Park Racecourse will host what is arguably our city's biggest social event of the year, the Cairns Amateurs Carnival. Through the vision of its founder, Sir Sydney Williams, what began in 1959 as a small amateur meeting designed to bring city and country together has expanded over the years to become one of Australia's premier spring horseracing carnivals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People come from far and wide for the three-day carnival, which will see a big dose of fashion, racing, food, entertainment, mateship and no doubt a little frivolity. Kicking off tomorrow will be the ladies fashion high tea followed by the president's welcome cocktail function in the evening. Friday will see the ladies day at the track before the highly anticipated ANZ Cairns Amateurs Ball at dusk, one of the most prestigious events on the Cairns calendar, located in a waterfront marquee overlooking the stunning Coral Sea. If that hasn't already warmed your cockles, then Saturday brings an eight-race program culminating in the racing of the $150,000 Stella Artois Cairns Amateur Cup. It's events like this in many regional cities across Queensland that bring people together and inject much-needed funds into our local economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to take the opportunity to thank Cairns Jockey Club; the Far North Queensland Amateur Turf Club; and Cairns Amateurs President Ross Moller, his committee and his team for all of the hard work over the past months to ensure the 61st Cairns Amateurs Racing Carnival will be one of the best ones yet.</span>

I'm sure on this side of the House we could find lots of ways to spend $185 million. We could possibly stop cutting funding to schools. We could perhaps put more funding into health. We could perhaps put more funding into our universities. But, instead, after the medevac bill, what did we see from those opposite? We saw a political stunt where they reopened the Christmas Island detention centre. And you know what, that would be great if there were thousands of refugees to house there. But do you know how many refugees were housed at the Christmas Island detention centre? Zero. Not one. There were more guards at the Christmas Island detention centre than refugees. $185 million to guard over zero.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then what did we see? We saw a defenceless family with a two-year-old girl and a four-year-old girl taken there in the middle of the night. The girls were forced to go in a separate car to their parents to stay on Christmas Island, for no reasons other than a political stunt and cruelty by this government. I think that this decision can be reversed straightaway by the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs. It can be reversed straightaway by the Minister for Home Affairs. Instead, the government continues the cruelty and continues to waste money, spending millions and millions of dollars to lock up four-year-old and two-year-old girls on Christmas Island. It's a disgrace and they should reverse the decision today.</span>

Ken Allen, a resident of Whale Beach, is a remarkable community member who is focused on bringing people together. In 2001, Ken received a call from former Prime Minister John Howard to pack up his life and move to New York to take up the role as Australia's consul-general. Ken and his wife, Jill, arrived in New York just two weeks before September 11 2001. Jill recalls that she did not see Ken for four days straight as he went over and above in his new role to ensure that every Australian was accounted for.</span>

This sparked Ken to bring together a global village and to unite Australians all over the world. In 2006, at the end of his time as consul-general, Ken formed Advance, an initiative supported by the Australian government. Advance is an organisation that brings Australians all over the world together. Advance represents the largest network of global Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in Australia, with 20,000 men diagnosed and 3,500 deaths each year. Prostate Cancer Awareness Month is this month, September, and the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia is encouraging Australians, particularly blokes, to host barbecues. I've just been to one of those barbecues, hosted by the member for Leichhardt. It's usually also hosted by the member for Blaxland, my friend Jason Clare. However, he was not here today, because he understands the importance of early diagnosis. He actually found a melanoma on his leg, went to the hospital and got it removed, and he is recovering well. He has been a champion of prostate cancer awareness. Chris Bowen, the shadow minister for health, stood in for him today and did a fantastic job.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm calling on all blokes to go and see your GP. Particularly if you're over 50 you need to get a PSA blood test, but if you've got a family history of prostate cancer you may need to get that test earlier. See your GP and remember that early detection absolutely saves lives. I send my solidarity to everyone who's fighting cancer and to their loved ones.</span>

I think about the Australians lost and how our world changed. I try not to think too much about what would have happened to me that day if it weren't for a very late cancellation of a work trip to New York which would have had me staying at the Marriott World Trade Center, where I most likely would have been at 8.46 am. There were 2,977 lives lost in those towers, on board those planes and at the Pentagon that day. Ten Australians died.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />Amongst the dust and rubble of the Marriott, which was first hit by the South Tower as it collapsed at 9.59 am and then wiped out by the North Tower as it fell at 10.28 am, lay the greatest symbol of our national identity: our Australian flag—damaged and torn but still intact. Detective Patrick McGee from the New York Police Department Emergency Services Unit visited Australia in the 1980s. As he joined in the recovery efforts in the aftermath of the collapse, he recognised the Australian flag buried in the rubble of the Marriott World Trade Center, torn and crumpled. The ashes that forever rest on the Southern Cross are a poignant reminder of those 10 Australian lives that were lost that day. Our symbol of home buried in the rubble of that terrible day in New York, the 9/11 Australian flag, now rests at the Museum of Australia as an enduring reminder of the tragedy we suffered with our ally, partner and friend. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Our motto, 'We all value excellence in sport,' says it all. Sadly, Peninsula Waves does not have a home stadium to play in. Jubilee Park is the home of the Frankston District Netball Association—12 clubs, 200 teams and thousands of players. It's the home of the YCW Football Netball Club and the Frankston Peninsula Cricket Club, and is bordered by the Frankston RSL. These stakeholders have all worked together for years to develop and advocate for a centre of excellence for women in sport at Jubilee Park. They deserve somewhere where women and girls can participate in sport with the facilities that support them to do it.</span>

The state Labor government have committed $10 million to this important development. I was really proud, as the Labor candidate at the federal election, to say, 'If we had won, we would have committed $10 million to this development.' What has the federal Liberal government done? I've found out, since being elected for Dunkley, there's $4.56 million available, which is much less than the $5.2 million they said was available, and they will not stand up and fund the $10 million. I'm calling on the government now: fund this development; my community needs it and wants it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The first meeting of the Taree universities campus steering committee came into being, and there was huge energy and support for the project.

New South Wales TAFE, industry and business, and local school principals are all committed to progressing the plan to develop the Taree universities campus centre.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  There are many people in the electorates of Bonner, Griffith and Moreton who attend the much-loved Holland Park Mosque. The Holland Park Mosque was featured in that delightful SBS documentary called <span style="font-style:italic;">The Mosque Next Door</span>, starring, dare I say, Moreton's cricket captain, Ali Kadri. It is Australia's oldest continuing-running mosque and has been operating for over 100 years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've enjoyed many celebrations, and I'm sure my good friends the member for Bonner and the member for Griffith have also enjoyed spending time with the people at the mosque—and some sad moments there as well. It saddens all three of us that this morning members of the mosque were confronted with graffiti on their front wall. The graffiti itself was hateful and divisive; it was vandalism that is disguising and unacceptable. It showed no respect for the people who have, for many years, worshipped there and who will continue to worship there after this morning. It's a place of meditation and peace, and it's welcoming. Us three—probably the entire chamber—stand with the Islamic community against such vile conduct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on the south side of Brisbane are a close-knit community and we care for one another. The mosque is a part of that community, having been there for more than a century. Support for those who live locally will always be bigger and kinder than the behaviour of the gutless, divisive coward who committed this act of vandalism. Australians are better than this. Good people love their neighbours and good people will always fight against religious discrimination.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  I'm very excited to be hosting the 4th annual North Sydney Seniors Expo on 10 October this year. This is a wonderful opportunity for seniors in my electorate to come together to learn more about local services. The expo showcases local community and volunteer groups, business, aged-care services and government agencies that provide services and opportunities to senior Australians living on the Lower North Shore. I am thrilled that General the Honourable Sir Peter Cosgrove has agreed to open and speak at the expo and that Lady Cosgrove will accompany him. Sir Peter has made his post-vice-regal home in our area and, as he said to me recently, he is one of our newest retirees. Sir Peter has made an extraordinary contribution to Australian life and is well loved by so many Australians. I'm sure many people will value an opportunity to hear from this great Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also very grateful to all the organisations who participate, particularly community organisations and volunteer groups that provide opportunities for seniors. These organisations underpin the very fabric of our society and help maintain strong connections with the community. My thanks also goes to Norths, at Cammeray, who are hosting this event again for us this year. Last year there was extraordinarily interest in the expo, partly because of the rock star attraction of Julie Bishop, and it was pleasing to see so many hundreds attend. I encourage all those who are interested to come along and take part this year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  I recently met with and heard from several Jagajaga residents about their deep concern over the way climate change and the environment are being managed by this government. One resident of Viewbank, Rosemary Wealthy, came to see me to raise her concerns. Rosemary and her friends meet each week at her house to discuss eco diversity, forest preservation, climate change and renewables—issues that impact us locally, nationally and internationally. Rosemary and her friends are not the people who probably come to mind when we think of activists. Indeed, some in this place may characterise them as 'quiet Australians'. But, while they are diligently meeting to discuss their concerns and working out what they can do to support action on climate change and support our environment, this government is actively denying the problem.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Pacific neighbours are telling us about how their homes and their livelihoods are being threatened. We're seeing devastating bushfires and spring has just begun. The AMA is warning of the serious health effects of climate change, particularly for young people and the elderly. And, all the while, Australia's greenhouse gas emissions are going up. The government plans to use Kyoto carryover credits to try to meet our climate targets, and the minister says he doesn't know if climate change is man made. Well, the people of Jagajaga know; Rosemary and her friends know, and they deserve a government that knows and that takes action on climate change.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr MORRISON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:01</span>):  I thank the member for Herbert for his question and the great work that he did during the course of those devastating floods, and the work that he continues to do with his local community as they rebuild.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the question is best answered by Michael Bulley from the Donut King outlet in Townsville, who's just one example of the many who have been assisted to get back on their feet after the devastating floods. Left uninsured and having just refurbished his shop, he was faced with paying for a second new shop fit-out. Michael has said quite openly that without the $50,000 grant his shop probably wouldn't have reopened, leaving his 12 staff out of a job. He is grateful for what he described as the life-changing support when he needed it most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's the $75,000 primary producer grant and the Spring Creek Barramundi farm, located just outside of Townsville, run by Brenda Pike, Tim Bade and Simon Osborne. That grant has assisted them to rebuild and get staff back to work. The floods cut off their roads, blew out the pine walls, collapsed the roof of their processing room and eroded their production ponds. They said that being able to access these funds 'really helped us get back underway as quickly as possible and helped to minimise some of the financial hardship felt after the disaster'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government responded quickly when it came to the floods in North Queensland. We've made over $3.3 billion available to assist people, businesses and communities recover from the floods. Over $118 million was provided and paid to 96,000 individuals in disaster recovery payments and allowances. Over $232 million was paid to the Queensland government under our Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements for the provision of immediate assistance, including immediate grants and loans and mental health support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The North Queensland Livestock Industry Recovery Agency is driving delivery of assistance to our farmers. Over $18 million has been approved in grants to help farmers with restocking, replanting and rebuilding. And $86 million has been paid to over 1,600 farmers under the $75,000 primary producer grants, and $8 million has been paid to around 600 small businesses under the $50,000 small business grants program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Elsewhere in the country now, in Queensland and New South Wales, more Australians are impacted by natural disasters. Nine houses have been destroyed, and a further seven have been damaged in north-eastern New South Wales by fires. Seventeen houses have been destroyed in Queensland, and another 86 houses have been damaged. Our government is supporting both the New South Wales and Queensland governments through the jointly funded Commonwealth-State Disaster Funding Recovery Arrangements. Assistance under these arrangements has been activated in seven local government areas in New South Wales—Armidale, Clarence Valley, Glen Innes, Inverell, Tenterfield, Uralla and Walcha—and two in Queensland: Scenic Rim and Southern Downs. They can expect the same support that we were able to provide so quickly and swiftly to the people of Queensland in the floods. We'll also be there for those affected by fires.</span>

There are many communities in his Queensland electorate presently beset by drought. As he told me a little earlier, sports fields, those fields of dreams, have turned into dust bowls. This is, as I'm sure all members would agree, heartbreaking. They've been forced to truck in water to Miriam Vale, population 500. I know there are a lot of other communities across the country where this is a sad fact too. This is cattle country, where the member for Flynn comes from, and beef producers—indeed, all small businesses—are feeling the pinch. Whether it's Eidsvold, Emerald, Gayndah or elsewhere, people encountering drought are doing it tough.</span>

                  </a>  I'd like to think that we as a parliament, Member for Hunter, would offer bipartisanship—the sort of bipartisanship that Bill Kelty, a good union man, is offering the Foundation for Rural and Regional Renewal. He's partnering with John Sharp to take up a position in that august organisation. He knows what a role that organisation is playing.</span>

As we go through these tough times, it's important to know that the government—as I said, the parliament should—and indeed organisations such as FRRR are behind them.</span>

The Australian Industry Group warns our nation has a skills crisis, with 75 per cent of businesses struggling to find qualified Australians to fill jobs. So why has this government ripped $3 billion from TAFE and training and done nothing to stop the loss of 150,000 apprenticeships and traineeships?</span>

The member would be fully aware that TAFE is funded by state governments; it's not funded by the Commonwealth government. That's why last year I initiated a review, which was conducted by Steven Joyce. That review found that the funding and the spending that was going into skills education in this country, year in, year out, was not getting the results. The results they were not getting were that people weren't being trained with the skills that were needed by the employers who wanted to employ them. And that's because of the outdated funding model and the processes that had been put in place over many years and were run by the previous government. These are the things we need to fix, and this is what we intend to fix.</span>

We're a barely a week out of winter and Australia is burning, but as millions of people join the worldwide climate strike on 20 September your drought minister doesn't even accept the science. Meanwhile the Paris Agreement commitments are inadequate because the current pledges, including Australia's, have us on track for a catastrophic 3½ degrees of global warming. Given that you'll already be in the US meeting Donald Trump, will you attend the UN global Climate Action Summit in New York and will you do what the UN Secretary-General is asking of all world leaders and lift Australia's greenhouse ambition so that we don't warm the planet by more than 1½ degrees, or will you travel all the way to the US but boycott a crucial global climate crisis meeting?</span>

Australia takes very seriously the issue of climate change and that's why we're taking action on climate change. And that's why, as a government, we're meeting our targets. Plenty of other countries set targets, but not many, like Australia, meet them in the way we meet them. When we came to government there was a 700 million tonne deficit when it came to meeting our 2020 Kyoto targets, and we set to work immediately and turned that around, and we will now exceed the Kyoto 2020 targets by 367 million tonnes.</span>

So I will not accept, whether it's from the member for Melbourne or anyone else anywhere else, that Australia is not doing its own heavy lifting when it comes to taking action on climate change. We are doing our heavy lifting. We are setting our targets, we are meeting our targets, we have the programs in place and we've been investing billions of dollars to achieve that. The member for Melbourne can talk down Australia all he likes, but, when I go overseas, I always talk about the good things Australia is doing.</span>

The member for Braddon is a beef farmer. He's a soldier who's proudly served his nation and he can trace his family connections back to the 1850s in his electorate. Around 40,000 taxpayers in the electorate of Braddon will get a tax cut as a result of the policies that this side of the parliament endorsed and the legislation that went through the parliament just a few weeks ago.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">How good are tax cuts? They enable Australians to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. As of today, $15½ billion has made its way out of the doors of the Australian tax office and into the pockets of hardworking Australians. Around six million Australian taxpayers have got a tax refund for the 2018-19 year. The result of our tax cuts is that we are now creating a simpler, stronger, fairer tax system—abolishing a whole tax bracket—and 94 per cent of Australian taxpayers will pay a marginal rate of no more than 30c in the dollar. Lower taxes, you would think, would have the support of both sides of this parliament. No! No! It didn't have the support of those opposite. They fought us every step of the way with our tax cuts.</span>

                  </a>  Oh, he says 'no'. I take the interjection from those opposite because let me remind them what those opposite said about our tax cuts. The member for Rankin is not looking because he knows. They said our tax cuts were 'offensive'. They said our tax cuts were a 'con job'. The member for McMahon said our tax cuts were 'reckless'. Now we see a tug of war between the member for Grayndler, who is backed up by the member for Hindmarsh, and 'Chairman Swan', who is backed up by his acolyte, the member for Rankin, over the $387 billion of higher taxes. But today there was another player in that debate. The member for Maribyrnong came into the debate and he said it was inevitable that they would have to rethink their policies. I think this is the first time the member for Maribyrnong and the member for Grayndler have been on the same side of a debate. The Australian people know that the Labor Party will always be the party of higher taxes, and the coalition will always be the party of lower taxes and more jobs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The member for Bass has been a local mayor, she has been a farmer and she works hard for her local electorate. She knows that the coalition is tackling the black economy. The black economy threatens the integrity of the tax system. It undermines community trust and confidence in our tax system, and it gives businesses and individuals who do not do the right thing an unfair competitive advantage over businesses and individuals who do the right thing. That is why this side of the House in government established the Black Economy Taskforce. Our response in last year's budget represented the first whole-of-government blueprint for tackling the black economy. We committed to measures which will see an additional $5.3 billion come into the budget for the government to spend on schools, hospitals, aged care and other services. We have completed 22 of the task force's recommendations, with another 36 currently in progress—shifting the taxing point for illicit tobacco, strengthening government procurement, increased integrity measures for high-risk sectors and a cash payment limit of $10,000. </span>

                  </a>  Why not, the Deputy Prime Minister asks. Deputy Prime Minister, I think it's because a limit of $10,000 is too low. $100,000 seems to be the order of the day for those opposite in Sussex Street. The reality is that stamping out the black economy requires us to stamp out big cash payments, whether it is on High Street or Sussex Street. The reality is that we are tackling the black economy, and as a result more money is going into the education and health services that governments, importantly, provide, and more confidence and trust is ensured in the Australian tax system from all Australians. </span>

What he will remember about Senator Sam Dastyari is that not only was he a shadow minister in the executive of the opposition at that time, he seems to forget the fact that money changed hands between the then Senator Sam Dastyari—money changed hands!—and his position was bought by that, with a loan to pay off his legal expenses, and he was caught in his own web of corruption. He should have resigned and he did.</span>

All Australians know that this government has a stable and certain policy when it comes to our border security, and so it must be. We cannot allow people smugglers to get in control of our borders again, like they did when the Labor Party was in government. Why is that relevant? Because 1,200 people drowned at sea, thousands of children were put into detention, and the reality is that Labor would repeat all of those mistakes again if they were to be elected into this parliament. When I'm asked about whether or not there are other approaches, I am reminded of a very informative article from the very well-connected James Campbell. Mr Campbell, as you know, wrote an article on 4 September—he is very well-connected to people within the Labor Party, I understand.</span>

Let me just remind you of what he said in his article, because it's interesting when we talk about the Labor Party position. He said, 'Kristina Keneally thinks she's on a winner by attacking border protection policies, but political history dictates she is so, so wrong.' He goes on to say, 'Anthony Albanese, of course, came to the leadership having voted against the motion at Labor's national conference that gave the party's blessing to the Abbott government's policy of turning back boats at sea.' He goes on with some very well-informed comments in relation to Ms Keneally.

I refer to the Prime Minister's previous answer, where he said the test was whether money changed hands. I refer to the government's responsibility for the AEC and its role in receiving financial returns for political parties, and I refer to a report in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span> by James Campbell that the Liberal Party returned $300,000 in donations from dinner guests associated with the member for Chisholm because of security concerns, and to the member for Chisholm's statement last night that the donation and its return was all made up.

I don't think this question is in order. Whilst it referred to a previous answer and a statement, the substance of the question very much went to the responsibilities of political parties with respect to declarations to the AEC. I appreciate that the member for Isaacs has endeavoured as best he can to talk about the responsibility of the AEC, but the issue he's dealing with is one of independence between the AEC and the political parties. I don't think the member for Isaacs would for a minute think that the Prime Minister administers or the minister actually administers anything to do with the Australian Labor Party's donations and dealings with the AEC. So, notwithstanding the Prime Minister's eagerness, I feel it is out of order. The Manager of Opposition Business.</span>

As the member is aware, the ensuring integrity bill presently before the parliament establishes a fit and proper person test for holding public office in both employer and employee associations. It would also ensure that both of those types of associations are subject to reasonable standards of conduct, so where you do have instances of serious and sustained breaches of proper standards there is an ability for the courts to consider deregistration.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is that necessary? Because Australia now has what the court has described as the most recidivist corporate offender in Australia's history: the CFMMEU. And that is not a description of one person. As truly shocking as John Setka's record of lawbreaking is, the problem inside the CFMMEU is beyond one person. The $16.4 million worth of fines for breaking the law represents 2,160 separate instances of lawbreaking. Of those, John Setka is only responsible for 22, being one per cent. As bad as he is, he is only responsible for one per cent of the lawbreaking inside the CFMMEU. Right now, today, in court, there are 68 representatives of that organisation facing 650 charges of breaking the industrial law. The court recently found that organisation guilty of inventing false safety claims against a crane operator. That is one of many charges. The court has described that organisation's behaviour as deplorable, disruptive, abusive, threatening, appalling, disgraceful, recidivist, unjustified and, finally, depressing. Bob Hawke said of them, 'It's just appalling. I wouldn't tolerate them. I would throw them out.' That's what he said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So why is it that Labor allows this to happen? Why do they allow it to happen? There are now two Ms in CFMMEU. Those Ms stand for 'Mo Money': Mo Money for the Labor Party. The more they break the law, the more the money flows. Let's just count backwards from last year. It's funny, we mentioned the AEC. A party political disclosure return with the familiar address of level 9, 377 Sussex Street shows: $120,000, $113,000, $218,000, $106,000, $230,000, $197,000. This is an organisation about which the court has said there is absolutely no evidence of any compliance regime. The good news, though, is there is some transparency. The money now comes in clear plastic bags, not brown paper bags as was previously the case.</span>

It is true that the Australian public demand of their government certainty around national security providing protection to Australians. We can only do that if, indeed, we have secure borders. So the government has worked day and night to clean up Labor's mess—50,000 people who arrived on 800 boats. The Labor Party put people on Manus Island. They put people on Nauru. They put kids into detention. It has taken many billions of dollars and many years to clean up. You would have thought by now that the Labor Party had learnt their lesson. But, clearly, with the flip-flop approach of the Leader of the Opposition they have not. It is clear that, had the Labor Party been successful at the last election, even though the former leader of the Labor Party had a much tougher stance and a much more coherent policy proposal in relation to border protection policy—</span>

                  </a>  I was drawn to some comments last week by the member for Watson, who doesn't have a proud record. He used to be the immigration minister in the glory days of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government period. As it turns out, there were 6,600 people who arrived on his watch. So, imagine my surprise last week when he was out there saying it would be in 'the national interest' for people who had come by boat to settle in our country. It's strange because, at the time when he was minister, he ran a $37 million advertising campaign—</span>

Something I've raised before, and I'm going to flag it right now so that there's no surprise: these questions are out of order. It's about the third one in a row that's out of order. You have 30 seconds to ask a question. I allow a preamble, but if I come to the view that these are deliberately outside the standing orders, I'll be cutting off the question. Really it's not the question; it's the statements that are clearly out of order.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've asked the member for Isaacs to acquaint himself with what I think is a very simple principle, and that is that you can only ask questions about a minister or the Prime Minister's responsibilities. The very beginning of that question was about political parties. One of the points that's well established is that ministers and prime ministers are not responsible for political parties; statements by members who aren't ministers, obviously; occurrences in party rooms; and a whole range of statements. I'm not going to keep repeating myself. It's very clear: the question's out of order. I think I've made my point. I'll hear from the Manager of Opposition Business.</span>

                  </a>  Thanks, Speaker. I am seeking your clarification because there have been a range of occasions, particularly when individual ministers have been under pressure, where something that would not otherwise have been in order has been treated as in order because they had made statements to the House. Yesterday afternoon, at the end of question time, in the final answer the Prime Minister gave an answer which, if it had been in the form of a question, offended every single example you have just referred to.</span>

                  </a>  What I'm saying is the principle that is applied to other ministers at different points when they are under pressure, which is that the opposition is allowed to ask them about the statements they have made to the House, has allowed us to ask questions that otherwise would not have been in order. That answer that was given by the Prime Minister yesterday should be able to be interrogated because of the issues it opened up. The Prime Minister went on to new ground yesterday afternoon, and it should be quite proper for the opposition to test whether or not there are examples that would be regarded as hypocrisy by that answer being given yesterday.</span>

It referred to things that aren't the Prime Minister's responsibility. Certainly members' statements can be referred to—I mean, that's a well-established precedent; I couldn't stop that—but just because the Prime Minister's made a statement, it doesn't allow the member far Isaacs to ask whatever he feels like. Let's be frank here, we're all politicians. I'm ruling the questions out of order. You know, there doesn't seem to be any upset or outrage from my left. I mean, let just call a spade a spade.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General, Minister for Industrial Relations and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:48</span>):  I thank the member for her question. Obviously, there's no more important task before this parliament than to protect children who can and have been the subject of these types of terrible and horrendous offending. The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2019 does exactly that. It does four very important things. Firstly, it brings into play new offences against grooming activities and for websites and online platforms designed to host the material. Secondly, it creates new aggravated offences for the most abhorrent types of child abuse, including where the death of a child occurs or a child is subjected to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment. Thirdly, it creates presumptions against bail and protection for vulnerable witnesses. And, fourthly, it introduces minimum sentences for the most serious child sex offences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is this bill required? Last year there were 18,000 complaints of child exploitation to the AFP, which represented a doubling of the number of complaints in one year. Prosecutions, which are often very difficult, are up 18 per cent since 2016-17. And last year, a staggering 28 per cent of convicted Commonwealth child sex offenders did not spend a single day in prison. In fact, since 2012, 42 per cent of Commonwealth child sex offenders did not receive a term of imprisonment. For those who did, the average length of time actually served was six months. These are matters that must be corrected, which is precisely what this bill does. It will provide specific and general deterrence by those four matters that we've noted, particularly with respect to minimum sentencing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a position, apparently, on minimum sentencing. It was expressed by the shadow Attorney­General in very clear terms. He said, 'Labor has a longstanding opposition to minimum sentencing.' He then restated, 'Labor is firmly opposed to mandatory sentences.' Given the importance of this issue, it is worth interrogating how longstanding and how firm that opposition is. Have there been offence categories which are so bad that exceptions have been created to this principle? Well, first, a Labor Commonwealth Attorney-General in this parliament introduced minimum sentences for aggravated offences of people smuggling. He said at the time that that reflected the seriousness of the activity being prosecuted. Second, all states have minimum penalties for homicide, and as recently as 2006 the Labor minister in Queensland affirmed and increased those. Third, Labor in WA introduced minimum penalties for aggravated home invasion. Fourth, last year the Labor government in Victoria introduced minimum penalties for those who assault public officers, including ambulance drivers. It raises this question: if it's appropriate to create an exemption, as I think it is, for minimum sentences to apply—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:52</span>):  I thank the member for North Sydney for his question because I know he's a really strong advocate for the eradication of plastic in our waterways. On this year's Australia Day he joined the 1st North Sydney Scout Group cleaning up litter at Berrys Bay. It is, indeed, often the case that young people—children in our schools, students—are the ones who are leading and seizing the opportunities that recycling brings. You only have to visit schools, as we all do, and talk to students. I was at St Paul's College in my electorate at Walla Walla recently and the canteen had five bins, all carefully labelled and all used perfectly. It's the students who understand the challenge that we face nationally and internationally in recycling. It's the students who will talk about the island of garbage in the Pacific, which is 1.6 million square kilometres in size—three times the size of France—and accumulating daily. It has 80,000 metric tonnes of plastic.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to the Morrison government's strong agenda on recycling because Australians care deeply about recycling and they want to be confident that, when they put things in their recycling bin or deliver them to a collection centre, those things will be repurposed effectively and not dumped in landfill or sent overseas. Every Australian generates nearly three tonnes of waste a year, 42 per cent of which is thrown away. This needs to change. At the recent Council of Australian Governments, the Prime Minister led conversations with the states that will lead to Australia banning the export of plastic, paper, glass and tyres. We would like to see that from next year. I will meet with ministers at the environment ministers meeting later this year and we'll sort the timetable and set the targets. We're moving from a national waste action plan from last year to the targets, to the delivery and to actually making this a reality. I mean, 123 local government areas, mainly in rural and regional Australia, have only one collection point. These are the sorts of things we can discuss with our state colleagues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This commitment reflects the national priorities that we came to government with at the last election. We have a $167 million recycling investment plan, but it's just the start. The Morrison government is leading substantial investment to transition us away from a linear economy of take, make and waste to a circular economy of reuse, repair, refurbish, remanufacture, recycle—a generational transformation in our recycling industry.</span>

A draft is well advanced. That will go out to public consultation. Of course, it was the case that members opposite said that when they came into government they would take 12 full months of consultation before presenting a draft. We'll do it well within that time. It's also the case that in matters of this type you must be very careful to ensure that you get it absolutely, utterly and precisely correct, which is what we will be doing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">To be fair to the crossbench, they have brought in two models for an integrity commission. They brought in one in the previous parliament. That was sensibly voted against by the Labor Party, that particular model. I say respectfully that that model was not the correct model. We will make sure that the model that is presented is the correct model. What is very interesting, though, is that another bill was introduced in the Senate by the Greens—basically, precisely the same model that was introduced in the previous parliament. Interestingly, this time Labor voted for it—against that model in the last parliament; for the model in this parliament in the Senate. It couldn't possibly be, Leader of the Opposition, that you were having a few integrity issues at the time? It couldn't possibly be that. It couldn't possibly be the case that, just as you have flip-flopped on border protection, just as you flip-flop on all other issues, just as you flip-flop on taxation—</span>

Not that long ago the shadow Attorney-General, late in the evening of Wednesday 31 July, came into the House and made some vigorous complaint about some signage that had been put out by a member of our side, the government, during the election. He complained that the colours were too close to that of another organisation. He said that there was barely perceptible script at the bottom which indicated the signs were authorised by the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party. He said it was sneaky. What is utterly fascinating is that the champion of integrity, who complains about signage and small script, using the colours of another organisation—</span>

It's been four years since the government commissioned a review of the small amount credit contract laws and 2½ years since the government accepted its recommendations. In these years, more and more Australians have fallen victim to excessive fees and interest of payday lenders—in many cases over 400 per cent. They are debt traps. When will the government introduce legislation to protect vulnerable Australians from severe financial harm? </span>

The Assistant Treasurer may also want to add to this answer. Smaller amount credit contracts, which are available for between 16 days and 12 months for up to $2,000, are important for some people because those people are outside the mainstream financial opportunities that may be available. They may have an irregular income. There are some 2,000 plus providers of these small amount credit contracts. That being said, we did conduct a review, we did release exposure draft legislation, and we've been talking and consulting on the responses to that exposure draft legislation. As the honourable member would be aware, in February this year the Senate Economics References Committee reported back on issues in relation to financial products and services that may be targeted at people at risk. Again, that is being considered by the government. So it is an important issue that the member for Mayo raises. The Assistant Treasurer is working on that issue. I just want to point out that it's about getting the balance right, which is obviously ensuring consumer protection but also ensuring that there are credit opportunities for people who may be outside mainstream finance. </span>

In fact his own electorate has been thrust into this fire emergency in the last 48 hours. Sadly, two homes were lost at Peregian Beach. These fires, which started late last week as high up as Mareeba, have spread right down the Queensland coast and into New South Wales and have taken 17 homes in Queensland and nine in New South Wales. There are 122 blazes still going. The federal government, at the request of the state government, immediately mobilised the resources of the Australian Defence Force, thanks to the defence minister, using Kokoda Barracks to house New South Wales firefighters who came into Queensland to help around Canungra. Canungra army base was also used. There were also water tankers helping Queensland firefighters to keep water up in their fight against those fires. Defence Force assets were also used in the area of Shoalwater Bay, where fires were close. With the aid of the Queensland government, we have also enacted the first stage of support payments to communities. There will be further assessments and applications made, but they can only be done when we can get state government personnel on the ground when it's safe. We cannot send those personnel in until it's safe. Once it's done, we expect those applications to come through, and we give the commitment that we will stand shoulder to shoulder with the state government and make sure those applications are assessed very quickly and that the money flows. It's important we do that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we also introduced the Emergency Response Fund legislation, a $4 billion fund that will create a $150 million dividend that will be paid every year, upon a catastrophic event—up to $150 million. This is on top of the disaster payments that we pay out to communities. On average, the Commonwealth government has paid $1.1 billion to state agencies and to the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can take solace out of this—the only solace we can take—that not one Australian life has been lost. That's because we have a world-class emergency management system, predicated by the backing of world-class emergency management personnel. They are the people who are prepared to put their lives on the line for us. In fact, Neville Smith, a New South Wales firefighter, has been injured. I'm pleased to report to the House that he's recovering well in a Brisbane hospital, and our thoughts and prayers are with him. Can I say to those emergency services personnel, who are prepared to put their lives on the line—in fact, in Neville's case, he was about to lose his own property—and are prepared to go out there and support us: you are truly Australian heroes.</span>

I'm just going to ask the member for Isaacs to reflect on my earlier comments. I was ready to sit him down halfway through the question. Given what I had said earlier, I was working on the assumption that the member for Isaacs would at least have a relevant word in the question. I'll ask him to reflect on it, and if he reflects in the wrong way, he'll see the response. The member for Stirling has the call.</span>

I'd also like to acknowledge all members and senators in this place, on both sides of the chamber, who have served in uniform, and to quite simply say to them: thank you for your service.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday was World Suicide Prevention Day, and I think all members would agree that every day is World Suicide Prevention Day in our country. The only acceptable number of suicides in our Defence Force personnel and in our veterans—in fact, in our whole community—is zero. I would encourage anyone who's listening who may be disturbed by the commentary, the discussion on World Suicide Prevention Day, particularly our veteran community, to contact Open Arms on 1800011046.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that we need to do more, and as a government we are doing more, when it comes to mental health and the wellbeing of our veterans and our serving members. I want to stress, as I do on just about every occasion that I get to speak in this portfolio, that service in the Australian Defence Force is overwhelmingly a positive experience for those members. We can be proud, as a nation, of the work that the members of our Navy, Army and Air Force do on our behalf to keep us safe in a very challenging world, but it can result, and it does result on occasion, in physical injuries and in poor mental health. We encourage serving members, and our veteran community, to please seek help early. The best chance of a full recovery is to seek help early, receive treatment and to then go on with the rest of your life, so we do encourage those serving members and our veteran community to seek help early.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a government, we have taken steps, which, I acknowledge quite freely, have been supported by those opposite, to support improved mental health of our veteran community and our serving members—changes like free mental health care for all veterans and their families. In fact, it forms part of a $230 million per year mental health budget to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. We've seen the expanding role of assistance dogs through a research program by La Trobe University, and now the Department of Veterans' Affairs is in a position to actually fund the purchase of assistance dogs to support our veteran community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was $30 million announced during the election campaign for six new wellbeing centres across Australia. We're rolling out those wellbeing centres in the weeks and months ahead in consultation with local members and the ex-service communities in those areas. Four million dollars has been announced for mental health first aid programs, in partnership with the RSL across the nation. And, only in recent weeks, I have had the chance to meet with not only state ministers but also backbenchers in this place on both sides of the House and sought their active engagement in our plans to have an improved new mental health strategy and action plan in place by the end of this year. So, as a government, and I think as a parliament, we are committed to putting veterans and their families first and eliminating the scourge of suicide across our nation.</span>

I've noticed, as the minister has, that there is a particular scourge in terms of suicide amongst veterans, which is running at something like twice the national rate. It is something that across the chamber we absolutely need to address, and I commend the minister for his efforts in working with us to achieve that.</span>

                  <a href="00AKI" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Home Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  Mr Duncan Lewis AO DSC CSC will conclude his term as Director-General of Security this Sunday 15 September. This concludes a very distinguished period of service to our nation, spanning some 47 years, both in uniform and in senior civilian roles. Fifteen of those years have been spent around the table of the National Security Committee, where Mr Lewis has diligently served governments of all persuasions in a number of vital roles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Graduating from Duntroon in 1975, Mr Lewis commanded at all levels, including command of the Special Air Service Regiment. His military career saw him serve in many conflict zones, spanning the Middle East to closer to home in East Timor. In his final military appointment as major general, Mr Lewis oversaw the Australian special forces engaged in operations across Iraq and Afghanistan. Not just content with his military service alone, he chose to do further to serve his nation in the Public Service, working in the National Security Division of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and serving as the inaugural National Security Adviser before his appointment as the Secretary of the Department of Defence in 2011. Mr Lewis served Australia's interests abroad once more in his capacity as the Australian Ambassador to Belgium, Luxembourg, the European Union and NATO between 2012 and 2014.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The role of Director-General of Security is one of great responsibility. As the 13th person to have held that position in our history, he has led ASIO for the last five years, in a time when Australia has been facing an unprecedented level of complex threats at home and abroad. Throughout his tenure, the national terrorism threat level has remained at 'probable', reflecting the heightened level of operational tempo within ASIO and across the national security apparatus of government. We have successfully disrupted 16 terrorist attacks since 2014, and Mr Lewis has played an important—in fact, an integral role—in leading ASIO's investigative and operational efforts, which have helped to protect Australians and our national interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Lewis has been at the forefront, albeit discretely, of Australian national security throughout his almost five decades of public service. I commend him most highly and thank him for that service and the way in which he's been able to engage with me personally during my time in this office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout his professional life Mr Lewis has had the absolute support of his family. He's married to the wonderful Jenny, and together they have provided a significant contribution to our country. Jenny Lewis has provided support and a contribution in her own way. We wish them both every success in their future endeavours.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  I rise to also recognise the quite extraordinary contribution Duncan Lewis has made to our national security over five decades of public service. Few senior officials can point to the range of experience that Duncan has brought to his roles. Most recently, he has been Director-General of ASIO for the last five years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past, threats to our security have been physical. These days, of course, there is cyberterrorism and a range of threats to our national security which have required a very complex, sophisticated and determined response. Duncan Lewis has brought diligence, professionalism, intelligence and integrity to everything that he has done in public service. His ability to straddle the differences between the worlds of military service, public policy, diplomacy and intelligence ensured that he brought a nuanced and sophisticated understanding to what are always very complex policy issues. In addition to the jobs that the minister has indicated Mr Lewis has done, he also served in the United Nations at the time of the complex war that was going on in Lebanon. He has an extraordinary capacity. At the time when I served on the National Security Committee—the professionalism we were served by, which other Australians don't see, by the very nature of the work they undertake, is something we should all be proud of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party strongly endorsed Duncan Lewis's commitment to building greater engagement with the Australian public by the national security and intelligence communities. It was not that long ago that you wouldn't have known who the head of ASIO was. Duncan Lewis took a decision, because of the changing nature of the threat to our national security, that there was a need to reach out and function differently. He has transformed the way that the national intelligence and security agencies have engaged with the Australian public. The Australian public understand, for example, the number of threats—and they're real—that were disrupted as a result of the direct action of the intelligence agencies. They also understand that, in order to keep us secure, from time to time our civil liberties can't be unhindered and we all have to make that balance between civil liberties and our national security. Duncan Lewis, perhaps more than anyone else, if you look at the capacity he has had over such a long period of time, has been the key person during the transformation that has occurred in the nature of the relationship between the Australian public and national security and intelligence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Duncan Lewis is also a great bloke. He is very upfront. He briefed me as the incoming Leader of the Opposition. You can ask him for advice and he'll give it frankly and fearlessly. He has always had just one interest. He managed to work in a Labor prime minister's office as a national security adviser, but he just as loyally serves the government of the day. He has had one thing in mind for five decades: the national interest. I pay tribute to him, I pay tribute to his wife and family and I thank him for his extraordinary contribution to our nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:20</span>):  Australia needs urgent action on climate change. In South Australia, particularly in my electorate of Mayo, what climate change has meant is extended bushfire seasons and it's meant coastal storms are becoming more dangerous, the impacts of which are becoming more severe. Climate change will have severe impacts upon Australia's national security, upon our economic security and our food security, upon public health and upon our natural environment. And regional and rural Australia will experience this more so than metropolitan Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The policy solution to climate change has been clear for decades. In order to incentivise changes in behaviour and the way we structure our economic production at both the corporate and household levels, we need price signals that include the real cost to society of the pollution that induces climate change. In simple terms, this means we need an emissions reduction scheme or an emissions intensity scheme, and there is broad expert consensus on this approach. John Howard, who many in this chamber consider to have been one of our greatest prime ministers, accepted this expert advice, as did former prime ministers Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard and Malcolm Turnbull. My former leader, former Senator Nick Xenophon, also accepted this evidence and policy solution. However, what subsequent governments have all struggled to master is the politics of it. The failure of Australia to adopt a meaningful and durable energy and climate change policy is an essential failure of Australian politics of our age—of this 46th Parliament and the 45th Parliament, and, indeed, the 44th.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rural and regional Australia, as I said, will face the brunt of climate change. And it is not only the top-tier issue of Australian energy policy that has faced repeated political failure; Australian vehicle emissions standards are the worst in the OECD by a wide margin—worse than Europe, worse than anywhere in the OECD—and things are getting worse. CO2 emissions from new Australian passenger vehicles are increasing at an accelerated rate. The public health outcomes of our inaction are, indeed, diabolical. While tight estimates are difficult to formulate, traffic pollution is estimated to cause approximately 3,000 deaths a year, so we can reasonably conclude that improving standards has the potential to save at least 100 lives a year. The government last conducted in-service vehicle emissions testing in 2009—a decade ago—so we do not even have an up-to-date or detailed understanding of Australia's vehicle emissions profile and how we should adapt international standards to Australian conditions. That is diabolical. The Ministerial Forum on Vehicle Emissions was established in October 2015 and has consulted broadly but is yet to implement anything of substance. That was four years ago. The horrible irony of all of this is that improving fuel efficiency standards would not only lead to better environmental and better public health outcomes but also save households, businesses and governments money because more efficient fuel means you have to buy less of it. Those of us who represent regional and rural electorates know that people are so heavily reliant on their cars. We don't have the public transport networks of the major capital cities, so it is imperative that we act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now wish to move on to the impact of climate change on water security. Droughts and water shortages are becoming more common in Australia, a fact known only too well by so many farmers. The area roughly between Adelaide and Brisbane has already experienced a 15 per cent decline in late autumn and early winter rainfall over the past few decades. Across the Murray-Darling Basin stream flows have declined by 41 per cent since the mid-1990s. As the electorate at the bottom of the Murray River, a sizeable part of Mayo is more vulnerable than most to the environmental degradation and the genuine possibility of system-wide collapse. We saw it teeter close to the edge during the millennium drought. In the face of climate change much more needs to be done to build environmental resilience at the bottom of the river. In my community during the millennium drought it was beyond heartbreaking; it was absolutely heartbreaking. My sister had a farm down at Milang at the time. It is one of the last major townships before the mouth. When you stand on the jetty in Milang and look out there's hundreds of metres before the edge of the water and you see the dying fauna. We can't allow that to happen in Australia again. We are allowing political pettiness in this place to distract us from real action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is for this reason that I have long advocated for a dedicated South Australian Murray research institute for the end section of this river. Such an institute would focus on issues including real-time summaries of the ecological condition of the river, to allow for provision of advice and remedies for intermediate and extreme drought events; funding for new solutions for managing water, salinity and nutrient levels in the Coorong, the Lower Lakes and the Murray in the context of real-time ebb-and-flow conditions; new ebb-and-flow management enhancements for the Murray River channels and floodplains; and monitoring and reporting socioeconomic benefits to stakeholders across agriculture, fisheries, Indigenous affairs, tourism and recreational groups, especially during ebb-and-flow events.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To complement this important work, Mayo urgently needs the Murray-Darling Basin Authority to have a permanent presence, specifically a regional engagement officer, in the Lower Lakes and Coorong region, ideally in Goolwa. This would vastly improve the two-way exchange of information between the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the local community and, in turn, improve the quality of the management of our part of the river, which will become even more critical as the impacts of climate change on our river community become more severe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are supposed to take into account the needs of our communities, address those issues and come up with solutions in this place. I often look back at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> from decades ago and think, 'My goodness, what insight and courage those members of parliament had,' while in this place we sit on our hands with respect to climate change. I wonder what children will do in decades to come when they open up the history books and see the lack of action in this place in 2019, in 2018, in 2017. They will be so angry at us. They will be angry because we are destroying their future. We have a responsibility in this place. Each one of us is the one person elected from our community to make positive change in this place. I urge every member in this place to read the science and come to this place with a solution, and let's get some real action on our emissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not doing well. Our emissions are going up. We all know this yet we continue to sit on our hands. Let this be the last time, the last year, that we do nothing. And let's make sure that we change for the future for our future Australians. It is a conservative thing to do to plan for the future generations, not to leave future generations with a burden. We often hear that from the government side—the burden of debt. Well, I say, the burden of inaction on climate change is just as important, if not more important, because we are destroying the future of Australians.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TAYLOR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:30</span>):  Thank you to the members from the crossbench for bringing forward this MPI. The members, I think, bring forward what is a very important issue and, like you, I've lived through drought in this region. I grew up not far from here and I remember well the early eighties drought and the impact it had on the people around me, on the people I grew up with, on my family, and on many others in regional centres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are devastating times for rural Australia, and climate matters. So, too, does access to affordable, reliable power. I visit so many manufacturing facilities and small businesses around Australia—cane growers, foundries, smelters—who all rely on affordable, reliable power for their jobs, for their families' welfare and for their lifestyle. This is enormously important and that's why my job as Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction is to bring power prices down whilst keeping the lights on and whilst we meet our international obligations. That's why we took to the last election our policy on a fair deal on energy for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the price side, while there is much more to do, I'm pleased to confirm to the House that recent ABS data tells us we're making good progress on electricity prices coming down. The ABS data shows that, in the last two quarters, we've had two reductions and that is very good news. We know that the default market offer reference price and other initiatives like the Retailer Reliability Obligation arrangements, which I'll come back to in a moment, have been important in achieving this outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, alongside that, we've seen record levels of investment in our electricity sector and it has been in renewable energy. I refer the House to Bloomberg New Energy Finance's work on this, which is very much in line with others. Australia is now leading the world in its investment in small-scale solar, large-scale solar and wind. In fact, our investment per capita was $514 in 2018. The next country in the world was almost half of that, Japan. So if you halved our investments in clean energy, we would still be one of the fastest investing countries in the world. Behind that are United States, Spain, United Kingdom, South Korea, Germany and so on. To give you a sense of how extraordinary this is, if you combined the investments in clean energy in the UK, Germany and France together, in 2018 we invested more per capita than all three of those countries combined, which is an extraordinary achievement. But it is creating an enormous challenge and that enormous challenge is: how do we maintain the reliability and affordability of our electricity grid with that kind of investment happening? That's why the government is committed to the Retailer Reliability Obligation, which requires the electricity retailers years ahead of time to commit to the capacity they need to meet their customers' needs. It's also why we've brought forward the Underwriting New Generation Investments program, with what were originally 66 projects put forward now down to a short list of 12, including a range of different technologies with a particular focus on firming up, on having access to variable power which is dispatchable—there when you flick the switch. I was down in South Australia not long ago, looking at pumped hydro projects at Goat Hill and Baroota up around Whyalla and the Flinders Ranges. These are great projects to be working on. There is more we're looking at. Gas is going to play an enormously important role in this, and I'll come back to that in a moment as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of that is focused on reaching our international obligations, our 26 to 28 per cent target. That is a strong target, as the Prime Minister said earlier in question time. Indeed, what it implies is a more than 50 per cent reduction in our emissions per capita by 2030 on 2005 levels; a 65 per cent reduction in the emissions intensity of the economy. If you want to compare that with other countries: the US's commitment is to 62 per cent, New Zealand's is to 61 per cent, the EU's is to 57 per cent, Canada's is to 57 per cent, South Korea's is to 57 per cent and Japan's is to 41 per cent. Again, we are leading the pack with a strong economy. That is the way it should be: balancing a strong economy with strong emissions targets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a comprehensive set of policies to continue to drive down emissions, but most important in this, as in anything in life, is track record. Let's look at our track record. When we came into government, the data showed that there was a 755 million tonne gap to reach our 2020 Kyoto obligations. We had to find 755 million tonnes of abatement when we got into government. Well, as of December last year, here's where we sit: we will overachieve by 367 million tonnes. Again, we're turning Labor's deficits into surpluses; that's what we do. A 1.1 billion tonne turnaround is what we have done here. We will keep going down that track. Now, as we look forward to 2030, of course we knew as of December last year that we had to find 328 million tonnes of abatement. Well, we laid out in Melbourne earlier this year, before the election, how we are going to do that down to the last tonne. One hundred and two million tonnes from the Climate Solutions Fund. That builds on the very good work of the Emissions Reduction Fund, which has delivered over 190 million tonnes at a cost of $12 per tonne. This program is the envy of the world. Among the Clean Development Mechanism and other mechanisms set up by the UN, this has been the best. It is an extraordinary achievement: low-cost abatement which doesn't destroy Australia's economy and which ensures that our businesses remain strong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We committed in the Climate Solutions Package to 63 million tonnes of abatement from energy efficiency. Let's be clear: the hardworking households and small businesses of Australia do a great job on energy efficiency, and they're going to keep doing it and we're going to keep helping them to do it. I was in the electorate of Higgins just the other day looking at these extraordinary technologies we're seeing now which are helping small businesses and households to drive energy efficiency. On top of that, we know we'll get 25 million tonnes of abatement from our major generation projects—hydro projects like Snowy 2.0 and Battery of the Nation. On top of that, they can firm up that intermittency which is such a threat to the reliability and affordability of our grid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite and some on the crossbench are keen to talk about our LNG exports. They see them as evil because—it is true—our LNG exports result in fugitive emissions, and energy is required for compression of the gas before it is exported. Those emissions from our LNG exports have been growing. There's no doubt about it. Last year they grew, at 4½ million tonnes. They've been a challenge for us in continuing to drive down emissions in Australia. But let me tell you what they're doing. They are reducing global emissions, because we are selling gas to China, South Korea, Japan—</span>

                  </a>  I see that the Greens crossbencher is not happy with this, because he knows it's the truth. They have reduced the equivalent of 28 per cent of our emissions a year in our customer countries. That is an industry we can all be extremely proud of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, the Labor Party and the Greens have a plan—different plans, but each as bad as the other, frankly—to destroy the economy in an attempt to halve the emissions in our economy by 2030, without laying out how they're going to do it. Fifty times we heard those opposite attempt to answer the question as to what the details and costings of those policies were, and they failed every time. The Australian people called them out, which is why the member for Hindmarsh has admitted now that it's time for a full-frontal review of their policies, because they got them wrong. Let me give them a tip: they should follow the WA minister's tip. He said, 'We respect the fact that the current government won the election and has a mandate to follow its policies through.' That is from a Labor Minister.</span>

We are barely a week into spring and already Australia is ablaze. We are suffering through the worst drought on record, and we've just been told to expect that our rivers are going to dry up even further over the coming months. We are being lied to by governments about the severity of the climate crisis. They are telling us it is under control, but pollution is going up and up and up under this government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time to tell it like it is. At the moment, temperatures have increased by a degree since the beginning of the industrial era. We've signed up to the Paris Agreement to say we want to limit it to 1½ degrees. We got told last year that we could hit, at the current trajectory, 1½ degrees as soon as 2030. What's worse, at the moment the Paris commitments that the minister is so proud of—that he's cooking the books for and using dodgy accounting tricks that no-one else is using to say that they're going to meet their commitments—have the world on track not to keep global warming below 1½ degrees but to hit 3.5 degrees by the end of this century.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know if the government understand what that means as they get up here and talk about how we should be proud of our achievements of increasing pollutions. The scientists tell us that a world that is warmed by four degrees has a carrying capacity of one billion people. One of my daughters is four years old. Her biggest worry at the moment is whether she's going to get a unicorn biscuit when we go to the markets this weekend—the answer is: 'You will if you're good.' But during her lifetime the carrying capacity of this planet is going to go down from 7½ billion to one billion people, if the scientists' predictions are correct. We are on the verge of extreme starvation, of massive conflicts and of movements of people around the globe like we have not seen before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are witnessing at the moment, as our rivers dry up and as record drought hits Australia, is potentially going to become the new normal. I do not want it to become the new normal, but this government is doing everything within its power to make sure that Australia has worse drought conditions. The government wants to make sure the bushfire season goes for longer. It wants to see us have more heatwaves. If someone told you that you were doing something that made the likelihood of bushfires greater, you would think you would stop it. If the doctor told you that you are sick because you are smoking too much and you'd better quit, otherwise it might get worse, you'd think you would come up with a plan to quit. But what is this government doing? This government can no longer claim ignorance, because the facts are there. This government have the full knowledge about how bad the climate emergency is. They have been told we have to cut emissions by 2030, and what are they doing? They are saying we need more coal-fired power rather than a plan to phase it out. They are saying we need to frack the rest of the country and suck up more gas, even though methane is an incredibly toxic gas, more toxic than CO2. And they are increasing emissions. Yet the minister had the temerity to come in here and lead his speech with power prices. Guess what? The independent Energy Regulator confirmed last week that electricity bills were less under the carbon price than under this government. That's what the Energy Regulator confirmed—and we were cutting pollution then. This government, because of its ideological war on renewables and because it takes money from the fossil fuel industry and has no commitment to reducing pollution, has managed to do what no other government has done—increase pollution and increase power bills. That is the record of this government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister boasts about renewable energy. That's because we had a thing called the Renewable Energy Target, which he tried to get rid of. That has ended. That has been met and will end in 2020, and we're now without any federal policy to bring new renewables into the system. This government stands condemned for increasing pollution year upon year, which is what it has done. People are going to look back at this debate, look at this government and see that this is the government that abolished the carbon price, lifted pollution and made global warming worse. And you will be held to account for it!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:45</span>):  It's a great pleasure to speak on the government's energy policy, and I do so with a particular focus on the facts. Those opposite clearly ignore the energy policy that this government has put in place. As the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction explained earlier, we're in fact leading the pack on an international basis, and I wish to refer to some of those facts here in this debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have, as the minister said quite clearly, a very strong track record. We're beating our emissions targets. But, most particularly, we are doing that in a responsible way whilst keeping our economy strong. As the minister outlined, we will overachieve our 2020 target by some 367 million tonnes. That's a turnaround of the emissions debt that we inherited when we took office, the 755-million-tonne shortfall that we had to turn around, and that is significant progress indeed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition took to the recent election our significant $3.5 billion Climate Solutions Package. That mapped out plans to achieve those tonnes that we've achieved thus far and to continue to do so, down to the very last tonne. We're going to continue to meet our Paris targets. As I said, progress is exceeding what was originally planned. We're supporting farmers, businesses and Indigenous communities in reducing greenhouse gases through the Climate Solutions Fund as well. Electricity prices obviously remain a focus of the government, so bringing on new electricity generation projects is part of that plan. We're talking, of course, about Snowy 2.0 and the Battery of the Nation, which is a significant development not only for the state of Tasmania but for Tasmania supporting the rest of the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the national power supply dependent to the tune of 85 per cent on reliable traditional sources, our economy is in fact witnessing a supplementary and record $25 billion renewables investment across 18,800 megawatts of new wind and solar projects. That generation is predicted to increase by some 250 per cent over the next three years. By contrast, the Labor Party and the Greens only have presented plans to the Australian people that would destroy industry—destroy, for us in regional Australia, agricultural industry in particular—at the same time as not providing for an energy future for our nation at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Particularly when you're in regional Australia, as I am, you get down to the facts. You want to understand what is really happening on the ground. Let me refer to my region of the Darling Downs. We have the New Acland thermal coalmine, which provides an energy source for local activities such as meatworks and so forth. It also provides an energy source for the Mater Hospital in Brisbane. There is also the Millmerran power station. Those traditional sources of energy, if you like, represent roughly 850 megawatts of supply there in the Darling Downs. We are underway with the development of the Oakey solar farm, about 80 megawatts. There are the Yarranlea solar farm, via Pittsworth outside Toowoomba, about a hundred megawatts; the Dalby biorefinery; the Oakey intermittent gas power station, itself representing about 332 megawatts; the AGL Coopers Gap wind farm under development north-west of Toowoomba, another 450 megawatts; and the proposed Cressbrook Dam renewable pumped hydro project, 400 megawatts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own backyard we are developing as much in renewables as we already have in traditional supplies. Those opposite, Labor and Greens, simply don't want to recognise that this transition is underway, that the coalition government is leading the charge and is in fact setting the pace on an international scale. They don't want to understand the needs in regional Australia. They don't want to appreciate or acknowledge our government's efforts to meet our emissions reduction targets whilst maintaining a focus on industry and jobs, particularly in regional Australia.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:50</span>):  It is self-evident to any sensible person that we are genuinely in the midst of a climate emergency. It is simply undeniable that the drought that grips this country right now is at least made much more worse by the fact that our climate is changing, and changing quickly. It is equally undeniable that the terrible bushfires in South-East Queensland and northern New South Wales at the moment are at least much worse on account of our changing climate. And of course they are, because it is an undeniable fact that Australia has warmed by more than one degree since 1910 and is still getting warmer. In fact, last summer was the hottest summer on record. Nine of the last 10 years have been hotter than the average for summer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Doing nothing is unfathomable and unconscionable. Either the members of the government know that the climate is changing and it is slowly destroying the country as we know it and they choose to do nothing—and that is unconscionable and unfathomable—or they are wilfully ignorant, which I suggest is just as bad. This already is and will continue to be the most shocking act of intergenerational social injustice this country has ever seen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't we care about our children? I do! And at the end of my days I want to be known by my children as someone who tried to do something, along with my colleagues on the crossbench. How members of the government will face their children and can think about their children, and their children's children, just beggars belief. It is shocking intergenerational social injustice. Don't we care about representing our community? It is another undeniable fact that the vast majority of Australians want everyone in this place, and in particular the government, to respond effectively to climate change. By one recently released measure, something like 80 per cent or more of Australians want us to do something about climate change. How can a government—any government—treat four out of five Australians with such utter and complete contempt? It beggars belief. Don't we worry that Australia has become a climate pariah? Something like 900 national, state and local government jurisdictions have now declared a climate emergency, yet we struggle in this place to get any interest in such a motion. I wish the member for Melbourne the best of luck as he seeks to move his own climate emergency motion through this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't we understand that an effective government that cares about our country, cares about our future, cares about our children, cares about the environment and cares about public opinion would come to its senses and put this country on a genuine pathway to net zero carbon emissions, put this country on a pathway to 100 per cent reliance on renewable energy? That would be a sensible thing to do and it would be in our nation's self-interest. Heavens, we could be the global powerhouse of renewable energy. We could be 100 per cent reliant, not just on wind or solar, but geothermal, hot rocks, tidal, wave, and we could become a centre of excellence in the globe for such technologies. We could create massive employment and massive wealth by not just inventing these technologies but manufacturing these technologies, selling these technologies and installing these technologies right around the world. Not only would that be good for the climate, it would be good for our economy. Heavens, wouldn't you think a conservative government would give two hoots about our economy?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the government to finally wake up to itself, to acknowledge that the climate is changing. I was horrified by recent comments by ministers still throwing doubt on whether or not climate change is relevant to the drought and to the bushfires. I call on the government to grow up, to read the evidence, read the public mood, based in large part on a massive shift to renewable energy, and finally do something about climate change. Because I tell you what, the alternative doesn't bear thinking about. Storms and droughts, climate refugees, water wars, disease: the downside of climate change does not bear thinking about. It's beyond time for this government to grow up, read the signs and do something about it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:55</span>):  I rise in this place to reject the ridiculous statements made by the crossbench that we don't care. We care $3.5 billion. Australia is pulling its weight in emissions reduction and keeping in line with its international obligations in combatting the effects of climate change. This is not something that other nations on this globe are necessarily doing. Everyone in this House cares about our future. We can all agree we want a sustainable future for those who come after us. We are setting targets and we are meeting targets. We are delivering, and we'll continue to deliver, on emissions reduction. Our per capita emissions continue to fall. Our total emissions have gone up 0.9 per cent, but that is because we are exporting natural gas to other countries, which provides them with cleaner energy than the coal they're using at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I highlighted in my maiden speech, climate change is real and affects us all. There is now a major and inevitable transition occurring in our energy sector to a cleaner and more sustainable energy future. As we can all agree, it is not just an environmental imperative to act; it is an economic one. We need to be open to new possibilities in reducing emissions, to hasten that future by using our Australian pragmatism to lead the world in sustainable energy. I believe that the Australian public is now ready for a mature conversation on new technologies. As a scientist, I know we have a wealth of opportunities and we need to diversify our energy base. We need to look at hydrogen, and I believe we need to look at alternative carbon-emission-neutral energy sources such as nuclear. This will only move forward with bipartisan support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are to work to reverse the effects of climate change on our planet, we must think globally but act locally. Even in my own electorate of Higgins, there are businesses working on innovative solutions to combat emissions and drive down electricity prices. In a recent visit to Higgins, energy minister Angus Taylor and I met with Richard McIndoe, the CEO of Edge Electrons. Richard was previously the CEO of Energy Australia. He is now fighting to reduce emissions. Edge has designed technology for businesses and homes that will reduce the power draw from the grid. This ensures that home appliances can run at lower voltage, thereby saving power, reducing power prices and helping Australians lower our emissions. This is an incredibly exciting business. We also met with CarbonTRACK, who've developed an app that will track the energy use of machines within the home, such as dishwashers, washing machines and televisions, and advise the best time to use them to ensure power efficiency. These are just some of the examples of what is happening in small businesses across Australia and is being supported by the Morrison government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Businesses can thrive and innovate when our economy is strong. When we have a strong economy we can get on with the job of investing in renewables and assisting businesses to do the same. We have unleashed a free market investment that is driving down costs of renewables as more innovative technologies come online. We are seeing record levels of renewable investment—in fact, double per capita when compared to similar countries, as the minister said just recently. And when we have a strong investment in a market, it will drive down prices, making renewable and energy-saving products available for every Australian. It helps to innovate businesses if they know they have a market.</span>

These projects not only will provide renewable power; they will also provide regional jobs for regional Australians and support the surrounding towns.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  Last week the AMA declared a climate health emergency, and I would expect the member for Higgins, as a doctor, also to be concerned. The royal medical colleges have also done so. This week, fires have been raging across northern New South Wales and Queensland. According to emergency services they are unprecedented at this time of year. This was forewarned in April, when the fire brigade chief said we were woefully unprepared for worsening fire seasons due to climate change. Of course, this is all happening in line with decades of predictions and warnings from Australia's climate scientists. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Reserve Bank have recognised the threat of climate change. They are now factoring a worsening climate into their modelling and decision-making when it comes to managing our economy. Our financial regulators, APRA and ASIC, have new guidelines on companies to report to shareholders on climate risk as it affects their businesses. Our Public Service and Defence Force chiefs have also been meeting for some time, planning for climate worst-case scenarios, which we are starting to see. All agree that Australia is especially vulnerable to climate change and that it is having and will have an increasingly devastating effect on Australia's economy, our health system, our national security and our food system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of adaptation is high. We are seeing this with the cost of droughts, fighting bushfires and increased demand on our hospitals and health services. It's not good enough to continue our current trajectory with weak targets, Kyoto loopholes, rising emissions and no plans to get to net zero emissions. We have had decades of missed opportunities and policy backflips. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an immediate and pressing crisis. Yet we have climate change deadlock in parliament. Labor's silence is deafening, and the coalition, beholden to its climate-denying right, is holding the whole country to ransom and continues to mislead the Australian public. Emissions are rising. Even our schoolchildren know that. The government argues we're doing enough. Come on—isn't it time to grow up and actually really do action? The public knows it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In comparison, India will achieve its Paris target of 60 to 65 per cent renewables penetration a decade earlier than expected. In fact they have increased their 2022 renewable target by 53 gigawatts. India is also meeting its Paris commitment to increase its tree cover. It has already added almost a million hectares of forest. Let's turn to the UK. We've inherited the UK's political system. It has the same left-right divide, yet it has had bipartisanship on this issue for some time. The UK has had a climate change act since 2008 and a climate commission that effectively reports to parliament and provides a roadmap and plan to reach its nationally determined contribution. They are meeting it and reducing their emissions by almost three per cent per year. In fact, they agree that as a developed country it's their duty to show leadership and, in the spirit of fairness, commit to more reductions. They are on their way to legislating to a net zero target by 2050, and they represent only two per cent of emissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">China, often quoted, is set to overachieve its nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement. It met its 2020 pledge three years ahead of schedule. It will update its national contribution in light of this. For the seventh consecutive year, China has led the world in renewable energy investment, contributing to almost a third of global renewables investment in 2018, with US$91.2 billion. China is leading the world on electric vehicles purchased, with more than 1.1 million in 2018. That's 4.2 per cent of their vehicle market share, compared to Australia's 0.24 per cent. They have a plan and fully intend to rival Japanese manufacturing of electric vehicles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an international citizen, Australia should be leading the way. Unfortunately, we're far from that leadership. After a decade of false starts, we were close in 2018 to making an important step in addressing part of our climate change policy with a National Energy Guarantee, but that was scuttled despite bipartisan support from all states and all industry stakeholders. We need a national energy policy to be introduced. We need a renewed Renewable Energy Target. We need the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and Clean Energy Finance Corporation. They are tasked to successfully promote and develop energy technologies and they need support and certainty. The sector is crying out for it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:05</span>):  The government do have a plan and we are delivering in spades with regards to this matter of public importance. Australia is going to exceed the targets we signed up to under international agreements. We have had an explosion in the last couple of years of investments in renewables—in fact, $13 billion in 2018 and $25 billion up until 2020. That, per capita, is more than the combined investment in France, Germany, and the UK. We are meeting our greenhouse gas reduction targets of 26 to 28 per cent by 2030, ahead of time. Our electricity emissions have dropped 15 per cent. The emissions intensity of our economy has also dropped 65 per cent. One in five houses have solar generation on their roofs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Climate Solutions Fund, which has taken over from the Emissions Reduction Fund, will deliver another 102 million tonnes of abatement. That's at a low cost of $12 per tonne. We do realise there is something to do in reducing our greenhouse gases but we do have an economy to run. People confuse their own personal circumstance and their household circumstances in turning to batteries and solar panels, both as a cost-reducing exercise and to do their bit. But when you have an industrial economy, you need baseload power and that's what everybody is starting to realise. You can't just unplug a baseload power system and plug in intermittent energy. The system integration required when you have intermittent sources of energy means you have to have inverters, which chew up some of the energy. You need whole new transmission lines to locate the new generation sources to the grid, because the economy runs on it. The total number of batteries in the country would run a place like Tomago Aluminium smelter for about 45 minutes. The biggest battery in one place in the world, in South Australia, can only take over running South Australia for four minutes. Batteries have a place in system integration but they're not a source of energy; they're a place that energy is stored.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side are doing things. We have new generation being encouraged. We have 12 new generating plants—gas, pumped hydro. We've got the Snowy Hydro plan being worked up. We're connecting the hydro electricity in Tasmania with the Marinus Link. But, again, you can have all the hydro in the world in Tasmania, except if there's no water or there is a drought. There was a time when Tasmania relied on diesel generators, like South Australia does. There is $750 million allocated for diesel generation in the South Australian budget, so we need baseload power. You can only get so much before your whole system has problems, like we are finding out. Some states have created their own problems, like South Australia and Victoria, pulling out their baseload capacity prematurely. The reason is that the engineering and the economics are not part of the narrative of this blind obsession with getting renewable generation. You can only use renewable generation when the renewable energy is available. You know, you may only get the energy out of a solar system 20 or 30 per cent of the time because there's night-time, there's daytime, there are cloudy days and weeks when it's raining. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the same with wind. You can only use it when the wind generating will allow a frequency and a voltage that fits with the grid, so there's a limit. The International Energy Agency issues reports on this all the time, and the magic number is 10 per cent—that's when you start having problems. Then, when you get to 20 per cent, it increases. Then, when you get to 30 per cent, you've got to re-engineer your whole system. You need voltage and frequency controlled, you need inertia in your system and you need a whole new transmission grid if we're going to do distributed energy. All those poles and wires around the suburbs will have to be replaced. If we're going to send electricity back down into the grid from everyone's three-kilowatt energy source, you'll need thicker wires and copper. It's going to cost an absolute fortune, so we have to maintain our industrial capacity because everything comes from an energy source somewhere. Whether it's coal, whether it's hydro and gravity, whether it's diesel running a generator or, as earlier speakers have outlined, it's nuclear energy, which heats— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  I agree with the member for Groom on one point: rural Australians want practical action on climate change. I grew up on a farm. I live on a small farm now. Like millions of people in regional Australia, the climate has never been an abstract concept for me. In Indi, our grapegrowers know that a single night of bad frost in the winter can devastate a wine crop for the year. In the north-east of Victoria, we know that in a spring deluge we'll be out there sandbagging our houses from the floods. And all regional Australians know that a hot summer brings with it the threat of bushfires and all the devastation that that might mean. We also know that these things are getting worse. We know that last year was the second-warmest and fifth-driest year in Australian history. We know that average soil moisture was the lowest on record and that water storage levels in the northern Murray-Darling Basin dropped below seven per cent—lower than at any point in the millennium drought.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All Australians know that it is spring and that Australia is already starting to burn. Climate change will make all of this worse, all of this harder for our rural communities. And as a nurse, a midwife and a rural health researcher, I know that climate change is a threat to people's health. The Nipah virus, a bat-borne disease that causes fatal infections in people in South-East Asia, is largely unknown in Australia, but climate change is pushing it closer. Rural areas already have higher rates of hospitalisation for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. As bushfires get worse, so will this. Heat related illness already costs Australia $8.7 billion a year. In Victoria, our 2009 heatwave not only caused $800 million of damage to the state, but, far more importantly, it killed 173 people on Black Saturday and another 374 people that week, likely from heat stroke. A PwC report has found that by 2050, a heatwave in an Australian capital could kill more than 1,000 people in a few days, and the people most at risk are the elderly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In an emergency, urgent action is needed. And here are three things the government could do today. First, start to develop a national strategy to deal with the impacts of climate change on agriculture and support the hard work our farmers are already doing. Second, tackle climate change as the public health crisis that it is. As the Australian Global Health Alliance has proposed, we should establish a health and climate change research facility in regional Australia so that we can better understand and prepare for the risks. Third, we should declare a climate emergency. When I worked in hospital emergency departments, we would plan for emergencies so when a crisis happened we knew exactly what to do. We need to do the same for climate—make a plan, do what we can to soften the worst of it, prepare for what we can't avoid and, when disaster hits, be ready.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to energy policy, a rational response to climate change means that renewable energy is not an obsession. The opportunities for renewable energy are too great to pass up. North-east Victoria has 151 sites that could host pumped hydro storage to provide dispatchable power to the grid. There is 6,500 gigawatt hours of storage potential in our mountain lakes, almost 20 times the capacity of Snowy 2.0. We need an energy policy that channels investment to capture these opportunities in storage and dispatchable power. In Indi, my electorate, where we have the most community renewable energy projects of any electorate in Australia, people are hungry for this, but across Australia this would create thousands of jobs for rural communities. Declaring a climate emergency not only means tackling one of the greatest threats to our farming and to our health but also brings these opportunities into focus. It would put a stake in the ground to say we take this seriously and we will stand up for the future of our farmers and for the health of our communities. Australians deserve no less than that.</span>

It is important to the people of Lindsay that we also focus on lowering the cost of living, ensuring that we have lower power prices. This is what's important to my community. Our government has a strong track record of meeting and beating our emissions targets while keeping our economy strong and keeping people in jobs. This is what is important to my community of Lindsay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Emissions per person and the emissions intensity of the economy continue to fall and are the lowest levels in nearly three decades, and we're investing in new technologies. Just last week, the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction announced a $4 million investment into a wave energy technology trial in Tasmania for the installation of a pilot-scale 200 kilowatt wave energy converter off the coast of King Island. The $12.3 million project harnesses the rise and fall of water levels to generate electricity. Our government is also supporting the development of an Australian-first waste-to-energy project in Queensland. The Logan City Council project will see a wastewater treatment plant that will have the capacity to transition water into energy, with by-products going to the agricultural sector. The Morrison government has committed $6.2 million in funding towards a project which is another great example of investing in new technologies that play a role in lowering emissions and lowering power prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we are focusing on emissions reduction, we are also concentrating on easing the cost of living and lowering power prices. A recent report commissioned by the Australian Energy Regulator, <span style="font-style:italic;">Affordability in retail energy markets</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> September 2019</span>, shows electricity bills falling across all regions for households on the median market offer. The report also shows that since the introduction of the government's default market offer price safety net on 1 July there have been reductions in both standing offers and high-price market offers. The Australian Energy Regulator makes clear that competition is alive and well in the market, with smaller retailers taking on the big three by providing cheaper offers. This is good news for people struggling to pay their power bills. The best electricity market offers are lower than they were in October 2018. The cheapest residential market offers are down three per cent, while small-business offers are 17 per cent lower.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are on track to overachieve on our 2020 emissions target by 367 million tonnes. This is a turnaround from the emissions debt that we inherited from the last Labor government. Through our $3.5 billion Climate Solutions Package, we have mapped out, down to the last tonne, how we're going to meet the 328 tonnes of abatement needed to meet our Paris targets. We have laid out how we will deliver our 2030 target 11 years ahead of schedule to the last tonne. Central to this is the $3.5 billion Climate Solutions Package, supporting farmers, businesses and Indigenous communities; reducing the greenhouse gases through the Climate Solutions Fund; building on the success of the of the Emissions Reduction Fund, which has purchased 192 million tonnes of emissions reductions since 2015; and bringing new electricity generation projects online, such as Snowy 2.0 and the Battery of the Nation. Not only are we going above and beyond our international commitments; we're also making a substantial contribution to reducing global emissions through our export sectors. The Morrison government has confirmed we will reach the 2020 Large-scale Renewable Energy Target ahead of time as we continue to support record investment in renewable energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Clean Energy Regulator has advised that the 6,400 megawatts of additional large-scale wind and solar generation needed to meet our 2020 target has now been commissioned. This has been achieved in less than two years, because we see this action as a priority of the government to explore new ways to deliver affordable, reliable energy and to keep our economy strong. In 2018 Australia led the world in clean energy investment, with more than double the per-capita investment of countries like France, Germany and the United Kingdom. With the Renewable Energy Target set to be exceeded, investment is not slowing down, and this is important to create jobs. Only the Morrison government has a plan to deliver affordable, 24/7, reliable power, keeping our economy strong and ensuring jobs while meeting our emissions reduction commitments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  It's a great pleasure to rise in the chamber today to support the government's National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2019. Affordable, accessible health care: that's the commitment we made to Australia and to Australians, and that's the commitment we're keeping with this bill. Last election we went to the people of Australia with a very clear plan—certainty and stability. We outlined as part of the plan a number of pillars, and the Australian people liked what they saw: lower taxes, secure borders, getting on with building infrastructure to get you home to your families sooner and safer, and a stable economy that funds essential services—and that's a key component which can sometimes be overlooked. But the reality is: a stable economy is not an end in itself. It has allowed us, and will allow the Morrison government going forward, to fund the essential services that are part of our plan to strengthen our world-class health system and guarantee the essential systems that Australians rely on and that make their lives better. Because the LNP can manage money responsibly, we can afford to do this for Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of our plan is to make life-changing medicines more affordable, and this bill today supports the sustainability and operation of the important Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The PBS has been providing medicines to Australians for over 60 years. As the son of two pharmacists, I know firsthand the difference that quality, cost-effective medicines provide to children, families and seniors. Throughout all stages of life, no doubt most of us or our family members will require at some time—knock on wood—access to medicines for illnesses that will have a profound effect on our quality of life. And that access to medicines will be via local community pharmacies, particularly for an ageing population.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a son of pharmacists, as I said, my mum and dad own a pharmacy across the road from a retirement village. I found out firsthand and came face to face with the important work that the more than 200 pharmacists in the Ryan electorate do for the community. They are a safety net and they make a big difference to people's lives. Community pharmacists don't just dispense medicines; they help their customers in their local community deal with addiction and with mental health, they pick up conflicts in medicines and they help older Australians manage complicated cocktails of medication.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In some cases, without the PBS, medicines that many Australians rely on would cost tens of thousands of dollars per year. They would simply be out of reach for most, if not all, Australians. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, however, means that concession cardholders pay a maximum of $6.50 per script and non-concession patients pay a maximum of $40.30. In fact, 91 per cent of PBS scripts are given to concession cardholders, who pay just $6.50. Since coming to government, the Morrison government has listed over 2,100 new or amended medicines on the PBS, or an average of one per day. That's an investment of over $10.6 billion in life-saving drugs that are helping to improve the lives of everyday Australians. These medicines help people suffering from epilepsy, severe asthma, heart disease and cancer. That's one new or amended life-changing medicine every single day, making an impact on tens of thousands of Australians' lives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To give you an idea of the importance of some of these drugs and their impacts, I will refer to some of our most recent listings. Tagrisso was recently listed for lung cancer. It was previously costing patients $88,000 per year. Venclexta, a drug used to treat leukaemia, was recently listed, but prior to this, patients would pay $165,000 per course of treatment. Ibrance was recently listed as well. It is a drug to help Australian women battling breast cancer and previously had a cost of $55,000 per year. Those are just three examples. Imagine the impact that over 2,100 medicines listed under this government have been having on the lives of ordinary Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government doesn't believe that financial circumstances should impact access to treatment. Over 90 per cent of the PBS scripts are dispensed to concession card holders, including pensioners and low-income earners. I know that Minister Hunt understands this personally. He is well acquainted with the details of many of these drugs, and I know the sustainability of the PBS system is an important reason he has brought this bill to the House. He has personally spoken with many of the families who are impacted by the drugs this government is listing. He has heard the stories of these families—of young children, wives, daughters, husbands and sons—who have a better quality of life because of the drugs listed on the PBS. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister has personally taken the time to come to the Ryan electorate to sit with community pharmacists; as I said, there are over 200 of them in the Ryan electorate. He sat with some of these community pharmacists and talked about their businesses, because, at the end of the day, these are small local businesses and they face challenges—issues of cash flow, supply, the ability to compete with others and their desire to take a leading role in the health care of their community. An example is the fact that pharmacies have done so much to vaccinate our community from the flu. There were over one million vaccinations last season alone from community pharmacies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 5,400 pharmacies across Australia that together dispense 740,000 prescriptions a day or 270 million scripts a year. But some of them will fail, and when they do this bill is so important to provide continuity of service and, importantly, continuity of supply for PBS drugs. Australians who rely on these medicines need to have the comfort of a continued supply, and this brings me to this amendment bill. This amendment bill includes measures that will allow PBS medicines to continue to be supplied in the unfortunate circumstance where an approved pharmacist faces bankruptcy. This is particularly important in small and regional towns, where there perhaps are only one or two pharmacies available. In this instance, under these new measures, Australians who rely on vital medicines can have the security that provisions can be put in place to ensure there is no stoppage or delay in the supply of their vital medications listed on the PBS. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think that supply of these vital medications on the PBS would have bipartisan support, so it's shocking to recall—</span>

                    </a>  I will take the interjections from the Labor member. Because you would think that the PBS did have bipartisan support, and then we got to 2011. In 2011, in those heady days of financial mismanagement by the Labor government, hidden away in the very small fine print of the portfolio budget statements of the Labor Party's budget of 2011-12 was an announcement—not trumpeted in a press release or anything like that, but hidden away—to say that they would stop listing life-saving PBS medicines, until 'fiscal circumstances permit'. The question is: when under a Labor government would fiscal circumstances permit?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know they can't deliver a surplus. We know they can't manage an economy responsibly, and that's why it in fact wasn't until the LNP government that life-saving medicines were again listed on the PBS, as I said, at an average of one new medicine a day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So imagine how many people that has helped, but imagine also that, instead of freezing it in 2011, the Labor Party had listed a drug a day on average as we have managed to do. How many Australian lives could have been saved? How many more Australian families could have spent more time with their loved ones if the Labor Party had managed the economy properly? We talk a lot in this place about financial indicators. We talk a lot in this place about the importance of having responsible management and a strong economy, but this is the human side of that. When you have a Labor Party and a Labor government that can't manage an economy, the human side of that is that Australians don't have access to life-saving drugs. Under the Morrison LNP government, they now do. Over 2,600 drugs have now been listed. So, next time we hear a scare campaign from Labor on health—next time we hear them talk about how they will spend more money on health than ever before—we will think back to their record in 2011 and 2012, when, for all the heady spending promises that they brought to the Australian people, they so damaged the economy that they got to the point where they had to look sick Australians in the eyes and explain to them why they didn't have enough taxpayer money to list these vital drugs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Families rely on the PBS. Sick people rely on the PBS. The residents of Ryan rely on the PBS. That's why I'm so pleased to support this particular bill, which will ensure the stability and continuity of the PBS going forward.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:32</span>):  I am shocked to hear the member for Ryan and the absolute tripe that he talks about health care. Labor invented the PBS under the Chifley government. Labor under Gough Whitlam introduced Medibank, the first universal health scheme in Australia. It was universally applauded, destroyed by the Fraser government and reinvented by the Hawke government as Medicare in 1984. To hear someone from the opposite side promote their view of health above ours is just ridiculous. At the present time, Australians are facing increasing gap costs, increasing waiting times for specialists' visits and huge discrepancies in health care between rural, regional and metropolitan populations, so to hear the member opposite talk such rubbish about health care makes me feel faintly ashamed to be in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise today to speak on the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2019 and I've been looking forward to discussing this legislation, as I was in the previous parliament before it was dissolved. So I'm glad that this legislation has been reintroduced. This legislation deals with the supply of medicines, amending part VII of the National Health Act 1953 and making two minor changes. Labor is pleased to support this amendment because it will provide easier access for many Australians who may be put at risk of not being able to get their PBS listed medications if pharmacies fail. That being said, it would be remiss of me not to take this opportunity to school the government on some of their failures in health policy, particularly in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—but more on that later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been well over a year since the 2018 budget was delivered in this chamber, and yet the first change set forth in this bill implements a measure from that budget. This measure is designed to recover the costs of the pharmacy approvals process. Much like the government's promised infrastructure spend, which occurs in a galaxy far, far away, this is yet another example of the government's figures being out and their ambitions seemingly outstripping their capabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation deals with the costs associated with applications to open and relocate pharmacies. I suspect that this is a topic that we will be dealing with quite a bit over the coming years. I have in fact been contacted by a number of pharmacists that operate or seek to operate within my electorate. They are well versed in their statutory obligations and regulations. I suspect there is a desire for further change in this domain, but plans on this have been curiously lacking from the health minister and those opposite. Applications to open and relocate are assessed by the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority, which then makes recommendations to a delegate of the minister. This bill seeks to recover costs that are associated with this approval process from the applicants themselves. The government's figures estimate that this recovery mechanism will save Australian taxpayers around $3 million per annum. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I referred earlier in my speech to the fact that I'd been looking forward to discussing this bill in the 45th Parliament and the fact that this mechanism was introduced in the 2018 budget and has only now been reintroduced. Members may find it interesting to know that the cost recovery component of this bill had actually been scheduled from 1 July 2019. This did not occur, because of the government's failure to bring forward this legislation for debate in the previous parliament. This is yet another example of the chaos and dysfunction that is at the heart of the coalition government. It is indicative of the fact that they consistently give up on governing and preserve their efforts for badmouthing unions and denigrating Labor. It's no wonder politicians get a bad rap when they see the vacillating and the lack of effort on the part of this government in health care. The delay in action from the government has meant that taxpayers have continued to foot the bill for the pharmacy approvals process for quite a long period of time—almost two years, in fact. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second change introduced by this bill is an important one, as it deals directly with the supply of medicines to all our constituencies. Specifically, it aims to continue the supply of PBS listed medications in the event of a pharmacy going bankrupt or being passed into external administration. Under this bill, the Secretary of the Department of Health will be given a framework that will allow them to grant and revoke permission to a trustee to supply medicines listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme at a location where an approved pharmacist has declared bankruptcy. That is quite important, particularly in rural and regional areas, where pharmacies are facing increasing cost pressures and access pressures and, therefore, are at risk of failing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome any steps that will seek to improve access to medicines for those who need them. The government says that this will ensure that continuity of access to pharmaceutical benefits is not compromised in the event that a pharmacy is bankrupt, and I'm pleased to support this legislation. However, there are a range of other barriers that the government is well aware of that are preventing Australians from accessing medicines and that are not addressed in this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first barrier I want to draw upon is affordability. We know that for many Australians access to healthcare services is severely limited, and in some cases health care is simply unaffordable. Recently I saw a child in my clinic at our local hospital with quite severe asthma, whose mother couldn't afford the number of medications that were required to keep this child out of hospital and keep him stable. She was forced to pick and choose between what preventative medications she could buy for him. Consequently, he had chronic symptoms and had had a recent admission to hospital with his severe life-threatening asthma. We know that for many Australians, particularly those that are already financially stressed, affordability of medication is a very big issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken previously about how out-of-pocket gap costs are soaring for patients and the fact that 1.3 million Australians are delaying or avoiding Medicare services each and every year due to costs. That is also true of medications. The government's own figures show that Australians are not filling their prescriptions, because they cannot afford them. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that one in 14 people, or seven per cent of Australians, are delaying or avoiding taking their prescribed medications because of cost. This includes people with coronary vascular disease taking statins or people with hypertension taking antihypertensives. They are really putting their own health at risk because they cannot afford the medications. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the next few hours I will be speaking in the debate on the Health Insurance Amendment (Bonded Medical Programs Reform) Bill 2019 about the disparity that exists in access to health care across Australia and the fact that life expectancies vary in an almost stepwise fashion from inner city to metropolitan, to outer metropolitan, to rural, regional and isolated Australians. There is almost a stepwise decrease in life expectancy across that continuum. This is something the government has failed to address. We know that in the most disadvantaged areas the rate of people skipping prescriptions, at over 10 per cent, is twice as high as it is in the least disadvantaged areas, at around seven per cent. There's no disputing the fact that the cost of medication is contributing to health inequality in Australia. And we know that health inequality is contributing in a very strong way to financial inequality. I am gravely concerned that we're becoming a society where only the wealthy are afforded access to health care. I think this is a tragedy, and it's something Labor has continued to try to address since the 1940s. Our universal healthcare system is at risk if we continue along this trajectory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Shockingly, those opposite have sought to make matters worse. Members would do well to remember that the coalition, in their horrific 2014 budget, actually proposed to increase the cost of PBS medicines by up to $5 and sought to increase the threshold for the Medicare safety net. They also talked about a Medicare co-payment, further restricting the poorest Australians' access to health care. This would have been applicable even to pensioners, demonstrating how truly out of touch the coalition are in healthcare matters. It would have resulted in patients being forced to pay an additional $1.3 billion over four years for the medicines they needed. There's no doubt in my mind that this would have resulted in even more Australians forgoing the medications they needed, putting their health care and their own lives at risk. The government sought to attack those who needed health care, taking $1.3 billion from the pockets of patients, many of whom are among the most vulnerable Australians. In stark contrast, the government, in its chaos and dysfunction, was unable to bring forward legislation that would save taxpayers almost $3 million per year. How out of touch can you get!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was Labor's strong opposition to these out-of-touch proposals that prevented the government from implementing this measure, which would have seen the cost of medicines increase. Their leader may well have changed, but Australians would do well to remember that this Prime Minister and this health minister were part of a cabinet that sought to make medication and health care more expensive for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know how much the government and the minister love to turn the PBS listings into a theatrical event. They love to boast about how well they're doing and their ability to list on the PBS something that has been recommended by the independent TGA. In reality, the government's own figures paint a very different picture. In Senate estimates, the Department of Health revealed the truth that there are more than 20 drugs that this government will never list on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme because negotiations on pricing with the manufacturers have broken down. The government has been unable to work with the manufacturers of these drugs and appears to have put it into the too-hard basket. That is in spite of the fact that these medications have been strongly recommended for listing on the PBS by independent experts, the Pharmaceuticals Benefits Advisory Committee. As we all know, the committee recommends that medications are listed when they stack up on clinical and cost grounds, so the government should be striving to reach an agreement with the manufacturers, not putting it in the too-hard basket.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will say that the fault lies with the manufacturers, that these companies are not sufficiently motivated to list these medications on the PBS at an appropriate price. This is a dismal argument. The process of getting positive recommendations from the PBAC is quite arduous and costly and can take years, and I think the manufacturers have done their bit. The determination for these drugs to be listed is evident through the steps taken by the manufacturers to succeed in obtaining their positive recommendations. The manufacturers want the drugs listed, the experts recommend that they be listed, but the government says no. Why aren't these drugs on the PBS? It is because the government has refused to offer a fair price and is failing to invest in our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which means that Australians are missing out on these vital medications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government are always quick to toot their own horn when it comes to listing medications. It's time they revisited these potential listings. The coalition needs to match Labor's commitment, taken to the last federal election, of an affordable medicines guarantee. The guarantee would have seen a commitment to list all drugs recommended by trusted experts, and the government is in a position not only to match our commitment but to honour it by listing these drugs. I cannot stress this enough: we must be doing more to ensure that all Australians have equitable access to the best quality health care. We need to address the growing disparity that exists in terms of access and affordability, to ensure that we do not wake up one day and realise we have an ineffective healthcare system, similar to the United States, that punishes the poorest and where only the ruling elite and fortunate few are able to access the best 21st century care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very worried about this. Those opposite seem to think it is some sort of scare campaign; it certainly is not. I know that access to health care in my electorate of Macarthur has become increasingly difficult for those who are the poorest. I still do a clinic in our local hospital. I see those who have struggled to access private care for their children and I see some terrible outcomes for those who are the poorest in our electorate. I welcome any measures that seek to address this, but it seems the government has no plan—no plan to actually look at the increasing gap costs and no plan to look at the increasing inequality in health care—and yet the actual statistics are staring them in the face. The National Party should be ashamed of itself in the way it's allowed health care in the bush to be so poor compared to that in the city. They've done very little to address it, and they need to address it urgently. I cannot say enough that the—</span>

But I must say that reducing the PBS safety net threshold by around $100 for general patients will not make a great difference in the grand scheme of things in terms of resolving the affordability issues that presently exist. I would hope that the government would place issues around affordability and access at the forefront of its mind when it comes to the— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:44</span>):  It's a great privilege to be able to get up and speak on the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2019 before the House, because this bill speaks to the very clear success of the Morrison government. What this bill, even in its modesty, seeks to do is to make sure that no matter who you are, no matter where you live and no matter the challenges you face, you'll be guaranteed a supply of medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in the community where you live, and with accessibility and affordability. That's at the heart of what this bill tries to achieve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's only a modest cost, at about $2.8 million a year, but it enables and makes sure that supplied medicines on the PBS, particularly to people in rural and regional communities, get the dividends of this government's strong economic management. We know full well that we have situations where pharmacies go into administration and that there are then challenges and problems that are faced directly by local communities in their capacity to access medicines because of the challenges faced by an individual pharmacist. What this parliament here today is saying is that regardless of who you are and where you live, you will not be left in doubt. You will not be left in the lurch. We understand that across this great continent, no matter who you are, you have a basic expectation about receiving basic medical care, whether it's from your doctor, whether it's in your hospital or whether it's emergency care, and also of course that you will have access to life-saving medicines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is particularly important because more and more Australians are living with chronic conditions, the consequence of an ageing population, and the need for additional support and assistance. That's what this bill seeks to achieve. It is relatively trivial in the grand scheme of things in terms of administration, but will have a real impact in terms of people's lives. The changes will bring applications by pharmacists in line with the Australian Government Charging Framework. The changes will help to ensure access to PBS medicines can continue uninterrupted where a pharmacy is affected by bankruptcy or external administration, and of course as I've outlined already. Where does this happen? It is particularly where there is only a single pharmacy within a community and therefore they need assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And this is against the backdrop of the entire Morrison government's health agenda and its economic agenda as well, because one of the things that those people on the opposition benches don't understand is that, if you can't afford to pay for medicines, you can't afford to deliver them to the Australian people. With more conditions receiving live-changing or life-improving or life-saving medicinal support, the government faces an ever-looming and greater challenge around financing the cost of the nation's health bill. It's only when you have a clear-eyed, controlled management of our nation's finances that you will be in a position to support this type of legislation and ensure the guaranteed supply of medicines to consumers at the end of the supply chain. This is why it's a fulfilment of the Morrison government's agenda for Australians—to make sure that nobody is left behind. Through the PBS, patients can access medicines that, in some cases, would cost tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars per year for a maximum of only $6.50 per script for concession card holders and a maximum of $40.30 for non-concessional patients. Patients will then, of course, receive free or reduced costs for scripts once they reach their safety net. And this is against a backdrop of the nearly 186 million different scripts that are signed across the country, providing access to important health and medical care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're averaging, as a consequence of this government's strong economic management, 31 new or amended listings per month, or approximately one per day. Compare that with the legacy of the last Labor government. We don't draw this distinction for trite political purposes or partisan purposes. We draw this distinction because, when Labor stopped listing new medications on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme because their irresponsible economic management meant Australia couldn't afford to list them, that had real human impacts on real people's lives. I can't think of anything worse than when a country has been so mismanaged, as it was previously under Labor governments, that you turn around to those that are sick, those that are suffering and those that are confronting life challenges and, of course, their own mortality and say, 'We stuffed up; therefore you can't get care.' That's the eternal shame that will always hang over those who sit on the opposition benches. They get up and carp and complain because whatever we do is never enough—like when we deliver tax cuts. Even though they went to the last election promising $387 million of new taxes, apparently ours aren't cutting fast enough. It's the same with their health agenda. They constantly talk about how they want more spending but they can never map out a plan about how they're going to pay for it. And, when they've been in government—don't just judge what they say; judge what they have done and will do—they have fallen short and left Australians who are already in difficult times and sometimes in their darkest hour in the lurch. It's about time they stood up and took responsibility for their actions and their conduct, and it's about time the Australian people held them to account for their empty promises and empty hope, as they did at the last election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill sits at the heart of exactly what this government is about. It's a government that's prudent and responsible, because then we're able to deliver the human dividend of making sure that, no matter who you are, no matter where you live and no matter your condition, this government and this parliament is in the best position to help, aid, assist and back you so that, when you're facing tough times, you're not doing it alone and so that you're certainly not being told by those in the Labor Party, 'Sorry, we can't help you because we can't help ourselves.' That's why this bill matters. That's why it's important to enjoy the support of the parliament despite the virtue-signalling amendments that have been put forward by our Labor opposition. Rather than talking about the fundamentals of what they would do to make sure they guarantee PBS access for millions of Australians, their consistent agenda, no matter what piece of legislation comes into this parliament, has been to drive distraction. We won't let them get away with it, because Australians can't afford to let us do so.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="248353" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McBRIDE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  I rise to speak on the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2019, and in support of the amendment moved by the member for McMahon. As previous speakers have indicated, Labor will support this bill, which amends the National Health Act 1953 to make two relatively minor changes to the supply of medicines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is well over a year since the 2018 budget was delivered, but the first change in this bill implements a measure from that budget to recover the costs of pharmacy approval processes. As many members know, applications to open or relocate pharmacies are assessed by the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority, which then makes recommendations to the minister's delegate. Under the bill before us, the cost of this process will be recovered from applicants. The government says this will save taxpayers around $2.8 million per year. I'd note that cost recovery was due to begin on 1 July 2019 but the government failed to list this bill for debate in the last parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second change under the bill aims to continue supply of PBS medicines following bankruptcy or external administration of pharmacies. The bill sets out a framework to allow the secretary of Health to grant and revoke permission to a trustee to supply PBS medicines at a location where an approved pharmacist is bankrupt. The government says this will ensure access to pharmaceutical benefits at an affected pharmacy is not compromised in the meantime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has consulted with pharmacists on this bill, and, as I said earlier, we will support it. However, I want to take this opportunity to speak in support of the amendment moved by the member for McMahon criticising the government for its record of delayed and withdrawn Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme listings. I also want to highlight some of the barriers many Australians face, particularly in regional Australia, when it comes to accessing essential and lifesaving medicines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister likes to come into this chamber and boast about PBS listings or drop a self-congratulatory press release on a Sunday afternoon, spruiking the latest listing, but what he doesn't like to talk about are those medicines that have not been listed—medications recommended for listing by the independent experts, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, PBAC. Last month the PBAC made public their recommendations from the July meeting, which took the total number of drugs waiting to be listed by the minister to more than 60—more than 60 medications that have been recommended because they stack up both clinically and on cost grounds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This includes drugs like Symdeko, which was approved in March by the PBAC. Symdeko is a lifesaving cystic fibrosis medication which treats the most common cystic fibrosis mutation, extending life expectancy and improving quality of life. The minister made a promise to those with cystic fibrosis that they would have access to Symdeko on the PBS as soon as it was approved. Six months later, and there is no word on when, or even if, the government intends to list this medication. If the minister wants to take credit for every new drug that's listed on the PBS, the minister must also take responsibility for delays in listings, and be held accountable for every drug that he refuses to list.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government claims that it hasn't listed some medications because the sponsors aren't sufficiently motivated to list these medications on the PBS, despite the fact these same sponsors have gone to significant effort to work through the PBAC process, which can take years and significant investment. They want their medications listed on the PBS, and the experts say that these medications should be listed. But this government's refusal to offer a fair price and to invest in the PBS means that Australians are missing out on these vital, and sometimes lifesaving, medications. In contrast, Labor went to the last election with an affordable medicines guarantee—a commitment to list all medications recommended by the experts. We strongly urge the government not just to match that commitment with words, but to honour it with listings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the only pharmacist in this place, and someone who started work as a registered pharmacist in 1998, I have a keen and longstanding interest in the affordability of medications and access to quality health care. Long before I was the member for Dobell, I believed everyone should have access to affordable health care, including affordable medications. As a pharmacy student in 1996, when I studied drug legislation, it became apparent to me that this was a complex area. But what struck me then, and today, is how important it is to the lives of millions of Australians. We are lucky that, by and large, medicines in Australia are affordable, and that is due to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is one of the pillars of Australia's universal healthcare system, a system that is world class and the envy of many countries. Labor is incredibly proud of the PBS. As many of you know, it was established in 1948 by the Chifley Labor government and has been in place in various forms ever since, despite the efforts of those opposite to tear it down. Labor fought to create the PBS, we have fought to strengthen and maintain the PBS and we will always fight to protect the PBS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is only through the PBS that most Australians can afford the medicines that they need, but we should not underestimate the impact the cost of medicines can have on household budgets, even with the assistance of the PBS. The cost to individuals living with complex chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, which require multiple medications, adds up. The government's own figures show that many Australians don't fill prescriptions, because they can't afford them. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 961,000 people a year delay or avoid taking prescribed medicines due to cost. These are people who have seen the GP, have had their doctor's assessment and know that they need this medication but have to skip it. They have to make a choice: 'Do I fill this prescription or do I fill that prescription?' The rate of people skipping prescriptions is twice as high in the most disadvantaged areas. In the most disadvantaged areas 10 per cent of people delay or avoid filling prescriptions, meaning that the cost of medicines is contributing to the widening health gap in Australia, particularly in regional and rural Australia and particularly in the current drought. In communities such as mine in Dobell, on the Central Coast of New South Wales, the cost of medicines can be prohibitive, especially with the rising cost of living and with wages failing to keep up. People on low incomes, or income support in particular, often have to make difficult choices about whether they can afford to have their prescriptions filled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday was World Suicide Prevention Day and tomorrow is R U OK? Day. I spent almost 10 years working at Wyong Hospital in my electorate. For most of that time I was a specialist mental health pharmacist working in acute adult inpatient mental health units. People living with major mental health problems are particularly vulnerable and most impacted by rising healthcare costs. What has the government done about this affordability crisis? It has only made it worse. In the 2014 budget the government proposed to increase the cost of PBS medicines by up to $5, even for pensioners, and to increase the threshold of the PBS safety net. This would have forced patients to pay $1.3 billion more for medicines over four years and would have caused even more Australians to skip essential medicines. Only Labor's opposition in the parliament stopped the government from implementing this cruel measure. Australians shouldn't forget that this Prime Minister and this Minister for Health were part of the cabinet that wanted to make medicines more expensive for every Australian.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Credit where it's due, Labor welcomes the government's election commitment to reduce the PBS safety net thresholds. That's why Labor matched the government's commitment within hours of its announcement in May. That's what should happen. Political parties should recognise and adopt good ideas from the other side. We urge the government to do the same with the health policies we took to the election. But let's be honest. Reducing the PBS safety net threshold from around $1,600 to $1,500 for general patients isn't going to solve the affordability crisis that I described earlier, so we strongly urge the government to consider how to improve the affordability of medicines as part of the Seventh Community Pharmacy Agreement and as part of its forthcoming review of the National Medicines Policy.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Minister for Government Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:04</span>):  I thank members for their contributions to the debate on the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill. The government understands the importance that members place on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. For your constituents and for all Australians, the PBS has provided affordable access to medicines for over 60 years. The introduction of an application fee for all applications to supply PBS medicines brings these processes into line with the Australian government charging framework. The fee will be paid when pharmacists apply for approval to supply PBS medicines. These changes were announced in the 2018-19 budget and support the overall sustainability of the PBS. The fee will apply to all applications to establish a new pharmacy or relocate an existing pharmacy and to applications involving a change of ownership of a pharmacy. The amount of the fee will be determined prior to coming into effect and will be calculated based on the regulatory activity involved in processing these applications. The Department of Health will review the fee each year and adjust it accordingly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also ensure access to much-needed medicines can continue following the bankruptcy of an approved pharmacist or where a pharmacy has been placed under external administration. These amendments are particularly important for rural and remote communities, where alternative access to PBS medicines may be limited. The approximate number of pharmacies affected by bankruptcy or external administration is about 20 each year. The bill provides the Secretary of the Department of Health the power to grant permission to an appointed administrator to manage the supply of PBS medicines at pharmacy premises. The new premises will assist continuity of supply of PBS medicines in the affected pharmacy until such time as the pharmacy can be sold or transferred to another pharmacist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank all those stakeholders who provided input into these changes during consultation on the bill—in particular, the Australian Restructuring Insolvency and Turnaround Association, the Australian Friendly Societies Pharmacies Association, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia. Australians have an outstanding health system and access to world-class medicines. The changes in this bill support the ongoing sustainability of the PBS. The Morrison government is deeply committed to the PBS and the Australian patients who benefit from the scheme. The PBS covers more than 5,000 clinically proven products across a range of conditions, from asthma and arthritis to diabetes and cancer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has a commitment to list all medicines on the PBS when recommended to do so by the medical experts. Since 2013, our government has made over 2,100 new or amended PBS listings at an investment of over $10.6 billion. We'll continue to list all new medicines on the PBS. That is in contrast to Labor, who in 2011 stopped listing medicines because they couldn't manage the economy. Due to our strong economic management, we're able to provide further support for patients who access the medicines they need through the PBS. Can I thank all members for their interest and support.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOWEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:14</span>):  The opposition will be supporting this bill. The bill amends the Health Insurance Act to legislate for a new Bonded Medical Program. It was announced more than a year ago in the 2018-19 budget. Of course there are already existing bonded medical programs. This bill makes what I think can be fairly described as largely uncontroversial changes. The new Bonded Medical Program will open on 1 January 2020 and gradually replace the two existing bonded programs. Labor notes the government's assurances that, compared to the existing scheme, the new program will: streamline administrative arrangements, with one statutory scheme to replace individual contracts to each participant under the current programs; standardise return-of-service obligations so that they're clear and easily understood by all involved, with each participant to serve three years in an underserviced area within 18 years of completing their medical degree; standardise penalties for not completing the return-of-service obligations, with sanctions including repayment of the Commonwealth support and non-payment of Medicare benefits for six years; and be more responsive to changing workforce requirements, with underserviced areas to be defined in new rules to be made under the act. This, quite correctly, will allow governments to update eligible areas over time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We welcome the fact that this bill includes transitional arrangements for participants in existing programs. Around 10,000 participants are undertaking a medical degree, training or return-of-service obligations under the existing programs. With some exceptions, these participants will be able to opt into the new program from 1 July 2020. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very important piece of policy more broadly. I'm not talking about the amendments in particular, which the opposition finds unobjectionable and in many cases sensible. But, more broadly, we face ongoing health inequities in Australia. People who live in rural and regional Australia have worse health outcomes than people in metropolitan Australia, and people who live in rural Australia have a lot of difficulty compared to metropolitan Australia getting access to medical treatment. It's not just about GPs; it's about specialists, where the shortages are acute. Importantly, a related matter, not directed affected by the bill, concerns allied health professionals. It's very important to have good access to allied health professionals in rural and regional Australia. This has been a focus of ours since the election. My early travels as the shadow minister for health have taken me to remote Northern Territory, to rural and remote New South Wales, to Bourke, Brewarrina, Walgett and Broken Hill. This will continue to be a focus for us in our policy development on this side of the House, because we think it's important that Australians, regardless of where they live, have access to very good health care. Of course we have to make our objectives reasonable; nobody is going to suggest that you can have a major teaching hospital in every country town. But people who live in rural and regional Australia deserve access to the very best health care that is possible and practical. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just about workforce or social determinants of health. There are broader issues at play, but workforce is key. We intend to continue to prioritise this area. Many honourable members may have seen, but some may not have seen yet, a very disturbing <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> episode this week about rural health outcomes. Again, these are issues which shouldn't necessarily be traversed in this bill, but they underline the scale of the challenge for rural and regional Australia to ensure that we are getting professionals into workplaces in rural Australia. I do want to acknowledge that some universities are doing good work. I would particularly note the University of Newcastle, James Cook University and Charles Darwin University, with a focus on both rural and regional medicos and medicos of Indigenous background who, in particular, go and work in Indigenous communities. All the evidence tells us that if you come from a rural background to start with and then go to medical school, you're much more likely to work in a rural region when you have become a qualified medico. So this is a very important area. We probably don't focus on it enough in this parliament. We will certainly be focusing on it on this side of the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Cabinet</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:14</span>):  In summary, the Health Insurance Amendment (Bonded Medical Programs) Reform Bill 2019 is one of the targeted, strategic responses under the Stronger Rural Health Strategy, which responds to the challenge of ensuring primary health care is accessible and available to all Australians no matter where they live. Only last week I was on the Eyre Peninsula and the Yorke Peninsula talking with local communities about access to doctors, and I realise how fundamentally important this is. This bill is part of a program to ensure that more Australians have access to medical services no matter where they are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the strategy, a total of $20.2 million was committed to reform the bonded medical programs. The bonded medical programs are a long-term investment in the health workforce by the Australian government. These schemes are designed to address the doctor shortage across regional, rural and remote Australia and in areas of workforce shortage. Participants receive a place in a medical course at an Australian university in return for a commitment to work in underserviced areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill introduces a statutory scheme, known as the Bonded Medical Program, to come into effect from 1 January 2020. The statutory scheme consolidates the existing Bonded Medical Places and Bonded Medical Rural Scholarship schemes. It brings these schemes under a single legislative framework to progress the government's long-term view to move towards a single bonded medical scheme—simple, elegant, understandable. The statutory scheme is clearer about the conditions applied under the program and provides greater flexibility for participants to complete their return-of-service obligation. Participants in the statutory scheme will continue to have right of internal review and now will be able to seek review of administrative decisions by the AAT. From 1 January 2020, new participants will enter the program under the new statutory scheme and existing participants will be able to opt in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The statutory arrangements will eventually replace the myriad complex contractual arrangements currently in place with individual participants. In effect, it is an administrative archaeological dig which is being replaced with a single statutory scheme. Statutory provisions will ensure that existing and future participants have access to the same suite of options and opportunities going forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These improvements to the program will encourage doctors to stay working in the community where they are undertaking their return-of-service obligations beyond their obligations and ensure that that there are more fully qualified Australian-trained doctors working in regional, remote and rural Australia and in areas of workforce shortage. Perhaps just as importantly, the reforms will better target the future bonded workforce to locations of need as demographic and workforce demands change over time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme will enable collection of data for reporting and effective evaluation of the program. At this stage it is too early to evaluate the program's success; however, it is critical that the government, the medical profession and the Australian public have access to robust evaluation of the program outcomes to inform policy decisions into the future. Without these changes, the program will become increasingly outdated, with growing frustration experienced by participants and the key stakeholder groups that support them. Therefore, steps to modernise the program are required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the government's long-term view to rationalise the Bonded Medical Program to a single bonded medical scheme once all existing schemes have expired. It is envisaged that this will occur around 2035, when all participants under the existing schemes have completed their obligations under the program.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:20</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the Health Insurance Amendment (Bonded Medical Programs Reform) Bill 2019. This bill amends the Health Insurance Act to establish a new bonded medical program. It is worth noting that this is a program that had been announced back in the 2018-19 budget. It is an important measure to try and improve access to health care and, in particular, medical professionals in regional, rural and remote areas. And it will replace two existing bonded medical officer programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important program that allows people who are graduating as doctors and also those who are completing their specialist training to work in regional, rural and remote areas. We know from recently published health statistics that there is a stepwise difficulty in accessing medical care in outer metropolitan, regional, rural and remote areas. The life expectancy of people who live in rural and remote areas is significantly lower than the life expectancy of people who live in inner metropolitan areas. Governments of all persuasions have struggled to deal with this over many decades. Unfortunately, what has happened is that governments have looked at many programs to try and improve access to medical care for people who live in rural and remote areas and have wasted a lot of time and money on things like locum programs and medical transport programs without really looking at the bigger issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Macarthur there is significant difficulty in attracting specialists, yet we are not seen as a place of workforce shortage—which I think is difficult because we are on the outskirts of a major city and we know that our health statistics are much poorer than for those who live in the more affluent areas closer to the city. I think there is room to expand access to our health service to people who are on the bonded medical scholarships. That's something we certainly should look at.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Aboriginal medical service, Tharawal, struggles to get paediatricians, neurologists, cardiologists, ENT surgeons and ophthalmologists to work in the area, yet the area is not seen as an area of workforce shortage. I would strongly suggest that there are ways that access to the outer metropolitan areas could be made available to those who are on bonded scholarships.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also think it's time we had a look at a bigger picture way of providing services to rural and regional areas. In particular, I think it's time to do away with this idea that medical services can be provided by paying extortionate amounts of money to locums. For example, if I want to work in some of the rural areas as a paediatrician, I can be paid $2,000 to $3,000 a day to provide those services as a locum. That is wrong. It is a waste of resources and a waste of money. What we need to be doing is looking at how our inner city teaching hospitals can provide the higher level medical specialist services to rural and regional areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I personally think that it's time for us to look at ways our states can be divided up into areas that are serviced by these teaching hospitals so every tier of the health service, from nursing staff to junior staff to senior medical registrars and senior consultants, is able to provide services from the teaching hospitals to these rural and regional areas. I think that is true of every state in Australia, and it's time for us in a bipartisan way to look at this way of providing service. Whilst these bonded medical people will provide some way of improving services, they are a small number compared to the number of people required in our rural and regional areas, so we need to look further. I also think we need to see how we can provide services through the Aboriginal Medical Services as areas of need, even if they are in the inner city.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm grateful for the opportunity to talk on this bill and I could talk for much longer, but districts of workforce shortage are not just in our rural and regional areas; they're in some of our outer metropolitan areas. I think we need to address that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <a href="248006" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BUTLER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:26</span>):  I rise to support this bill for an Indigenous standing member on the board of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. I note this is only the first step to deeper engagement and consultation with Australia's First Nations peoples and I acknowledge the minister, who has reached out in the spirit of bipartisanship in relation to this bill. In opening my remarks in relation to this bill I also acknowledge, of course, the traditional owners and Aboriginal nations of the Murray-Darling Basin. I also want to acknowledge the peak bodies that have undertaken significant work in relation to advocacy for Indigenous Australians with connections to the basin, like the Northern Basin Aboriginal Nations group and the Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations. I want to thank the Hon. Linda Burney MP, who is the shadow minister for Indigenous Australians. I also would like to acknowledge the Hon. Ken Wyatt MP, who is the first Indigenous member of parliament to hold the ministerial portfolio for Indigenous Australians. The significance of these leadership positions dedicated to First Nations voices cannot be overstated. I especially acknowledge their significance today, as the creation of dedicated positions for First Nations voices is pertinent to the contents of the bill before us, which seeks to establish a standing position for an Indigenous Australian on the board of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Murray-Darling Basin Authority is the principal entity responsible for managing the Murray-Darling Basin. Labor welcomes the provision set out in this bill for a standing Indigenous member on that board. The Water Amendment (Indigenous Authority Member) Bill 2019 will amend the Water Act 2007 to provide for a standing Indigenous member position on the board of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. It gives effect to the decision made by the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council at its meeting held on 14 December 2018, where it was agreed that a standing Indigenous authority member position should be established. The Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council consists of members from all basin states and the Commonwealth. The establishment of such a position will increase the authority's membership from six to seven members. It's important to note that this bill rightly does not preclude other authority members being appointed to the board who are Indigenous or who have expertise on Indigenous matters related to the basin. On this point, Labor believes that this bill should serve only as a minimum requirement and the first step to deeper engagement and consultation with Indigenous peoples in the governance of the Murray-Darling Basin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Indigenous authority member, as the position is referred to, will be appointed on the basis of their high level of expertise in relation to Indigenous matters in respect of basin water resources. This is characterised as experience with the development of cultural flows policy; working with the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder on using environmental water flows to address cultural needs; working with the authority on cultural heritage issues in the Murray-Darling Basin; and expertise in engaging or consulting with Indigenous people or other social, spiritual and culture matters relevant to Indigenous people in the Murray-Darling Basin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fundamental to this contribution are the significant differences between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal cultures, which are integral to the successful management and care of the Murray-Darling. Labor believes in the principle that underlies this bill—that First Nations peoples' voices must be heard in management of the authority on a permanent basis. The Basin Plan begins with an acknowledgment of the traditional owners of the Murray-Darling Basin, in which the MDBA:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… recognises and acknowledges that the traditional owners and their nations in the Murray-Darling Basin have a deep cultural, social, environmental, spiritual and economic connection to their lands and waters. The Authority understands the need for recognition of traditional owner knowledge and cultural values in natural resource management associated with the basin. Further research is required to assist in understanding for providing for cultural flows. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's belief in this fundamental principle was evidenced in the policy that my predecessor as shadow minister for the environment and water, the member for Watson, formulated before the last election. We announced policies that would have increased First Nations peoples' involvement in the governance, planning and operations of the Murray-Darling Basin. Labor made clear that fundamental to this process was the consent from First Nations peoples in the basin regarding governance arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we support the bill, we note that it addresses only one of the inadequacies identified in reports and recommendations in relation to First Nations peoples and the Murray-Darling basin. The South Australian royal commission into the Murray-Darling Basin Plan recommended that the authority have at least two standing Aboriginal representatives on the board from peak bodies established for the purpose of representing the interests of traditional owners in relation to water resources in the basin. Among other things, the South Australian royal commission recommended:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… a meaningful consultation should now commence between the basin states, the Commonwealth and the MDBA concerning cultural flow. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission also acknowledged the evidence that the basin's waterscape is intrinsic to the cultural identity of the basin's traditional owners. The commissioner said in his report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… contemporary Australian society has a considerable way to go in understanding Aboriginal culture, and the significance of water resources within it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He goes on to say that throughout the inquiry there were:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… pressing reminders of the damage and loss simultaneously suffered by the Aboriginal peoples of the Basin to their culture and way of life as a result of the over exploitation of Basin water resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that First Nations peoples have deep, highly valuable knowledge about the behaviour of their ecosystems, which should be central to the Murray-Darling Basin's care, restoration and management. So the appointment of an Indigenous authority member is long overdue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Water Initiative, which led to the Water Act and was signed in 2004, provided for Indigenous access to water resources and ensuring inclusion of Indigenous representation in water planning wherever possible. It also stated that, in relation to Indigenous access to water resources, water plans should incorporate Indigenous social, spiritual and customary objectives and strategies for achieving these strategies wherever they can be developed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations Organisation, there are some 75,000 Indigenous people living in Australia's Murray-Darling Basin, and most of these people are traditional owners who belong to more than 40 autonomous First Nations. Forty-seven different Aboriginal nations are currently represented by two umbrella organisations, the Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations and the Northern Basin Aboriginal Nations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The modern history of Aboriginal peoples' water is a litany of 'unfinished business', in the words of a 2017 Productivity Commission report. The authority with which First Nations peoples can speak to the health of the Murray-Darling Basin needs to be respected, heard and acted upon. In 2010, the First Peoples Water Engagement Council was established to advise the National Water Commission, but was abolished prior to the National Water Commission's legislative sunset. This council was established because biennial assessments by the National Water Commission found that states and territories failed to incorporate effective strategies for achieving Indigenous social, spiritual and customary objectives in water plans. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do note, in respect of Indigenous involvement in governance, that there has been some criticism of the Liberal-National government for their lack of consultation. Native title holders in the Murray-Darling area were critical of the government for excluding or not inviting them to emergency and management meetings during recent fish kill crises. There is community concern about the government's management of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, and it should be said that their failures to instil confidence in the management of the basin do affect First Nations peoples as well as farmers, environmentalists and the community. So I expect that we'll see some conscious effort to improve confidence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In talking about the role of water resources and understanding its significance in Indigenous culture, I just want to mention something central to that issue: an art exhibition I attended recently here—well, not quite here, but in Belconnen. It was entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Barka:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he Forgotten River</span>, by artists Badger Bates and Justine Muller. The Barkindji people, who have lived along the Barka—also called the Darling River—for thousands of years, were central to this exhibition. Barkindji means 'people of the river'. In Badger's words, the exhibition is a time line from the early 1990s to the present day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You get a sense of this even just through the titles of the works. I do want to encourage people, if they get the chance, to go and have a look at this exhibition. It provides a different perspective on the way that water resources affect communities, including Aboriginal communities. I sometimes think that understanding things through art is a wonderful and helpful additional way of coming to grips with some of the complex issues that we face.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Badger's artist statement describes his early lino prints that celebrate the life force and value of the Barka River. The work, <span style="font-style:italic;">Me Fishing in the Darling River</span>, tells the story of clear water in which Badger could see the fish and spear them. A work called <span style="font-style:italic;">No More Catfish</span> tells the story of what Badger describes as the first fish that seemed to disappear in the 1980s. <span style="font-style:italic;">Life Coming Back to Moon Lake</span> is about Lake Woytchugga at Wilcannia and how relieved the artist was that a 2010 flood brought an abundance of life. Ceramic footprints made by Justine Muller speak of the Barkindji people's fight in protecting the river. A mussel shell installation, <span style="font-style:italic;">Finished Up</span>, is about the loss of the food chain in the river as a consequence of the loss of the mussels, and also the effect that has on the rest of the food chain. The feeling of degradation is even more acutely felt when seeing the works visually. The deep feeling of loss at the possible degradation of the river is shared by many who are connected to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The exhibition was a sobering experience, but a reminder for me as to why legislation that comes through the parliament that enshrines First Nation voices is so important. There is obviously a great deal that can be learned from understanding Aboriginal cultural values and approaches to resource management. Virginia Marshall has written: 'Aboriginal communities relate to and contemplate value in the environment as integral to Aboriginal identity in a way that articulates both communal and individual belonging to country. The land, the waters and the creation stories are the essence of Aboriginal identity, where sacredness articularises an inherent relationship to the environment unique to Aboriginal peoples.' I think that those sentiments need to be considered as we work to instil trust and confidence in the management of the basin, including through the centring of Aboriginal voices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch on some concerns in relation to this bill. There have been some concerns raised in relation to the drafting; specifically, some have pointed out that the conflict-of-interest provision might limit the available pool of potential candidates for the newly created position. The bill requires that the standing Indigenous authority member not be a member of the governing body of a relevant interest group. A similar stipulation currently applies to all members of the authority board in order to prevent conflicts of interest, as I said. However, it has been suggested that the broad definition of what constitutes a member of a governing interest group might exclude many Indigenous persons with relevant expertise because of their participation in those organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Water Act defines this as being involved in the management of another entity that represents one or more classes of holders of water access rights, water delivery rights or irrigation rights, or who advocates managing the basin water resources in a particular way. Of course, I'm sure that the minister will look forward to hearing from people further about their concerns about the conflict-of-interest provision and its possible operation. As the shadow minister, I also look forward to hearing from Aboriginal communities about this issue in the course of formulating Labor's policy in the lead-up to the 2022 election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor wants to work with the government towards a bipartisan approach, but, as always, bipartisanship can't ever be a race to the bottom. The government makes promises about co-design and consultation, but it needs to deliver. Labor welcome the provisions set out in this bill to establish an Indigenous standing member. We remind the House again that this is merely a minimum requirement and a long-awaited first step in deeper and better consultation with First Nations peoples, including their central participation in the governance of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  I'd like to first of all say that what we are encountering in regional areas is the most exceptional drought for many in Australia's written history. That is not to say that it is the most exceptional drought in the history of Australia, but in written history it is beyond the pale. I would like to commend a person who is fighting bushfires in these dire circumstances—that is, the former Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon. Tony Abbott, who as we speak is fighting a bushfire at Drake, in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to manage this drought. We can't actually make the weather change. It will rain, and that's when the drought will finish. We have to be very aware of the extreme circumstances that are currently before us. These extreme circumstances in the natural environment would mean there would be no water in the rivers. The only places that we are seeing water now are below regulated dams and below where there has been the capacity to store water from other times and release it now. So, when people say water is entitled to go down the river, to go to a place, if you want to return it to its pristine, natural condition, then the rivers would be totally and utterly dry. I think that's worth mentioning at the present time, because we have also built the economies of so many regional towns on our capacity to get access to regulated water, and if we didn't have that we wouldn't have these towns.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to the Indigenous authority member, there must also be another side to this debate—that those people are also reliant on the economics that comes from water. In my own area, when I was at St George, I lived next door to the Waters family. Poddy Waters was the Aboriginal elder for the area. Ronny Waters and Jenny Waters were there. There were a whole range of Aboriginal people; they were a big part of our community. For them, the importance of the river was that it gave them jobs, and if you took away irrigation there would be no jobs. One of the greatest advocates for the irrigation industry were Aboriginal people, because that was their form of employment—in Dirranbandi even more so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason I say that is that if we ever get this belief that the only position that is held is that Aboriginal people don't support irrigation, then that is the wrong idea. Where there is employment, they support it absolutely. It gives them the capacity for commercial advancement. It gives them the capacity to have businesses in the area where their families are from and the prospect of a better standard of living. That benefaction might not be directly working on an irrigation farm; it might be owning a shop in town or, like the Aboriginal family next door to me, owning the hotel in town—the best hotel in town, to be honest, the St George Hotel. These things have also got to be part of this mix. So we don't see this as, ipso facto, we'll say 'Indigenous', which means that we're just going to turn the whole place into a national park, because I'll tell you right now: that's not what a lot of Aboriginal people want. They are very aware now—I was recently in the northern part of our nation—that, if they have their lands, their natural asset, they want to be able to utilise it in such a form that they make a dollar out of it. They don't like the idea, at times, that green legislation works its way in and usurps their position, making them merely the mechanism for an extension of green caveats on private assets or the removal of land to basically a national park, under the auspices that it is somehow of benefit to Indigenous people. I've also seen that in the past, when the other side closed down the live cattle trade. One of the biggest groups that that hurt was Aboriginal people. I remember Freddy Pascoe up at Delta Downs saying: 'Well, we've got 60,000 head of cattle here. How does this work now that we're not able to export them?' Why that's pertinent to this bill is that we have to understand that the Indigenous authority member is not necessarily going to be someone who's a raging advocate for the environment. He will probably be a raging advocate for the economic wealth and economic growth of Indigenous people in the Murray-Darling Basin, in whichever form.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I bring up the drought because it will rain. It is going to rain again and you're going to get floods again. I've lived on the Murray-Darling Basin for basically all of my life: in Danglemah, which is in the Murray-Darling Basin; in Moree, which is in the Murray-Darling Basin; in St George, which is in the Murray-Darling Basin; in Charleville, which is in the Murray-Darling Basin; and in Loomberah, which is in the Murray-Darling Basin. Probably the only time I'm not there is when I'm exactly where I am now, Armidale. One thing they have in common is that the economic benefit of living in that basin is its attachment to water. If you do not have that connection, that nexus to water, it would be an absolute bowl of poverty. We have to be very mindful that anything we do does not go to destroy the economic base of these areas. I am certain that an Indigenous authority member would absolutely have that at the forefront of their mind. There is no point in delivering economic misery to people by shutting down any further opportunity of economic growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something that has been discussed for a while. I'll leave it to the minister to describe how we go about picking this Indigenous authority member. I know there will be many, many applicants. I know not only that Indigenous people are involved in the cotton industry, the commerce of towns in the regional areas and the labour hire industry but also that a large proportion of people in the Murray-Darling Basin, in comparison to a place such as Canberra, are Indigenous. They're not a majority, but they're are a larger proportion than in other parts of Australia—on the coast, for instance. What happens to this system is incredibly important to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government, for its part, has invested billions and billions of dollars into making sure that we maintain the economic integrity of this area by making sure that works and measures have a large role to play in bringing back an environmental outcome without shutting down towns. We've seen in Mildura, the Macquarie and in the headwaters that it is vitally important that people clearly understand that we can provide environmental outcomes without having to shut down towns, and we must also focus on that. I am concerned that the current zeitgeist, by reason of the drought, is that there is somehow this drastic mismanagement of the river system, that there is some magical place where water is stored and has been held against the will of everybody else in the river system. That's not the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember that one of the great witches they always wanted to burn was Cubbie Station—somehow there was all this water at Cubbie Station. Well, take a drone to fly over it. There's no water at Cubbie Station. In fact, I think the last time they took water was in 2017, and that was only a small portion of water. Some of this mythology has been brought about to drive a political agenda to shut down the irrigation industry, but it's not connected to the hydrological facts. The hydrological fact is that we have the most exceptional drought in the written history of Australia. Until it breaks there will be no water. On the issue of Menindee, what we have there is water released to go south and no water coming in from the north—unremarkably, the water runs out in the middle. Yet you hear some of the rhetoric that is cast around, and it's all about some nefarious process. I'd say the only place that really has a chance of irrigated crops this year is not actually in the Murray-Darling Basin. For cotton it would be up around Emerald, because they still have carryover water there that they can utilise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that with this Indigenous authority member coming to play we take into account the wide range of views and uses that Indigenous people—they're called Aboriginal people in my area—have for the Murray-Darling Basin. It most certainly has an incredible cultural importance to them. It certainly has an incredible connection to the history of the area, and it is absolutely vital to the economics of the area. In that vein, it is just as vital to other people and the economics of the area. I know that the member for Nicholls will soon give a speech, and no doubt he'll also reinforce the economic imperatives of irrigation to regional towns. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Indigenous authority member will have a mighty job. It profits nobody if we further shut down the economic integrity of these areas, which is water. It profits nobody to make poor people poorer. It delivers nothing for the economy of our nation if one of our greatest food-producing areas is shut down from its capacity to do it its job. What I might suggest is that the future for Australia, to get a greater sense of water security—and maybe this is something that the Indigenous authority member could be part of the discussion towards—is to get further storages, more infrastructure, to bring new water at times as required from other catchments into the Murray-Darling Basin. There is a sense of contention. Something I've supported for so long is a form of the Bradfield Scheme that can bring water from the north of our nation down into the Murray-Darling Basin. This would cost vastly less than the NBN, but I think its economic benefit would be vastly, vastly more. If our nation were part of China, I'm certain we would have started it years ago. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The more we try to find a resolution and try to find water where water isn't, we realise that there is only one solution, and that's to find water where it's in abundance, in many instances where it's excessive and causes problems, and move it to where it's needed most. If we were able to do that, we would be able to take away so much pressure that has been placed on the economies of so many towns, where they have been asked to give up water for the requirements of the lower part of the river. The Bradfield Scheme, in one of its iterations, would be able to take water from the northern parts between Townsville and Cairns, where on certain weeks more than two Sydney Harbours flow out to sea from one river—I was looking at the Ross River in the last flood—and divert that in such a way that it would go into the Flinders, from the Flinders into the Thompson, from the Thompson into the Warrego, and from the Warrego down the Darling into South Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As long as Australia exists, people will be talking about this. As our population and water requirements increase, this issue will be before us. There are other dam projects that I know the minister is very aware of. One is getting Nathan Dam up and running, so it itself is moving water from one catchment into the other catchment, or part of it—from the Dawson catchment into the Murray-Darling Basin. In fact, it has been cited as one of the mechanisms to help with the water requirements of Toowoomba. The reason these projects are held up is that we've created a litany of legislation and regulation, overwhelmingly at a state level, and a bureaucracy that's so hesitant to actually build anything. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is all part of a plan that we have to have if we're going to bring about some long-term resolution of the issues pertinent to the Murray-Darling. Right now its greatest affliction is that it just has no water. In the immediate future we don't see any prospects of any water, because we don't see anything on the meteorological horizon that is going to bring water. We should be planning right now to do something that I think would be seminal in the further development of this nation: the construction of water infrastructure so as to move new water into that system.</span>

                    <a href="56430" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DRUM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:54</span>):  I'm very pleased to take the opportunity to speak to the Water Amendment (Indigenous Authority Member) Bill 2019. In doing so, I congratulate the minister for bringing this Indigenous member to the management of the Murray-Darling Basin to make sure that we take advantage of the knowledge that is associated with Indigenous water management and ownership—the way that they have been able to manage river systems into the past—some of the biodiversity issues and some of the damage that's happening to our river systems, and the way that our Indigenous forefathers have been able to fix up some of the damage and simply manage the river system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some scientists in the not-too-distant past have tried to rewrite some of the history associated with the Murray-Darling Basin, and that's been exposed. It is a really worrying observation that we now have a situation where some of the science that the Murray-Darling Basin was predicated on seems to have been false and seems to have doctored. A 2007 report that effectively says that the Lower Lakes were predominately saline was rewritten in 2009 to effectively say that for 7,000 years the Lower Lakes of Alexandrina and Albert were effectively fresh—whereas the original report accepted that they were saline.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a whole raft of issues out there around water management, river management and the forests associated with the Murray-Darling Basin. Last week I had the opportunity to host Minister Littleproud in the Barmah Forest where we were able to see firsthand some of the damage that's associated with trying to run more water down the Murray River than what the Murray River can actually cope with. We know that the Barmah Choke has a limit of around 9,300 megalitres a day. The Millewa choke is actually even thinner and lets less water through. The only way that the water authorities can get the water that they need down the river is simply to flood the forest, and we were able to see that firsthand. We were able to see the damage associated with some our current practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure if there were an Indigenous person on the authority they would look at that in a very, very dim manner. They would look at this and say that this is not the way the river system is supposed to run as an ongoing, everyday way of managing water. So I think there are some real benefits for this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also seen vast amounts of water being traded from one region, or one valley, into another valley. We have seen enormous amounts of erosion and degradation of the river systems taking place in the Goulburn. The way that the authorities have tried to fix up this erosion is to have further environmental flows. We had an environmental flow in the middle of winter which was valued at about $60 million—$60 million worth of water was just flushed down the Goulburn River in the middle of winter in an attempt to try and improve vegetation on the sides of the riverbanks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of these objectives and the uses of this environmental water have to be questioned, especially when we look at some of those environmental objectives associated with water use in South Australia: to take more and more water down out of agriculture so that we can supposedly keep the Murray Mouth open. That's not a natural occurrence. It has been scientifically proven that the lower lakes of Alexandrina and Albert were predominantly estuarine historically. We have spent $70 million putting water into the top of the bottom of the Coorong, whichever way you want to view it, to effectively try and improve the health of the Coorong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a whole raft of management projects that have been going on under Minister Littleproud's leadership, but we've still got this pain and the horrible impacts of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. We're still seeing farmers being forced off their land because of the ridiculous prices that water is currently achieving—this ridiculous price of $800 a megalitre. Nearly every commodity is out of the market once water gets to that sort of price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think mainstream Australians, by which I mean Melbourne and Sydney residents, understand truly the pain for agriculture that's been associated with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. I don't think they understand that so many outstanding farmers, mainly in dairy but also now in horticulture, are being forced off their lands. They're being forced to sell their cows or pull out their trees or leave fruit to rot on the trees, because they can't finish off the crop if they're not going to have the water to finish it off properly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are to have a change of attitude, a change of understanding, about whether we really want to have an active, vibrant and dynamic agriculture sector—and the answer to that is we do—then we have to have a conversation about what we do with this limited amount of water. We have a finite amount of water, unless we do what the member for New England was saying and try to introduce new water out of Northern Australia or introduce new water into the Murray-Darling Basin system out of Tasmania. If we are going to stick with the finite amount of water that we have then we have to have a serious conversation about what is the best use of the water that we have available to us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In times like those we're seeing in the north at the moment, when it is incredibly dry and there are very low inflows into the northern basin, it would be wrong to try to replicate a wet, or normal, year. If our environmental managers were to try and fool nature it would be the incorrect thing for our natural assets. These are some of the learnings that we could benefit from when it comes to having an Indigenous member of the authority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's list our environmental assets. Let's list our environmental objectives and outcomes. Let's work out what it is that we want to achieve. But that list cannot be endless. We have to have a finite list of objectives. What sort of health do we want to have the river in? What amount of water are we prepared to let flow down the river to create the optimal breeding time for the various species of fish? Or are we going to let the environment create an endless list, which means that when they get as much water as they can possibly get their hands on they're going to pull up another environmental objective, which will give them some environmental credibility to use that water on?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the lower Murray system there is so much water going down the river that has been traded out of the areas of historical productivity—namely, the Goulburn and Murray regions—into the Sunraysia and the areas around Robinvale and Mildura, where some of the high-value commodity crops are being grown. At the moment in horticulture, it's mainly almonds, table grapes and citrus that are able to afford far more than the other forms of horticulture and dairy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a significant question we need to ask. There have been literally hundreds of millions of dollars invested in the dairy sector in the Goulburn Valley in the last two or three years: stainless steel going into Cobram, Girgarre, Stanhope, Shepparton, Tatura and some serious investment in processing in the dairy sector. Now we're getting to a point where all of those processors are struggling to find the milk that they need to put through their processing plants. This has an enormous impact on employment, on regional development and on the lives and livelihoods of so many people throughout the Goulburn Valley. The pain is palpable. The hurt and the detriment that has been caused by taking water away from agriculture and putting it into the environment is real and is tangible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have every right to question every drop of water that is taken out of agriculture. We have every right to have every environmental flow, every drop of water, calculated and to have identified the outcomes they are hoping to achieve with a particular flow. And when there is water left in the system at the end of the year, and the agriculture industry is screaming out for that water, then maybe there's an opportunity for the environment to be a bit more flexible when it comes to loaning water back to agriculture so that communities can take advantage of that carryover water, water that wasn't used in the previous year. Certainly, that would have been very highly regarded and appreciated had it been put on to the market or made available to those who have water allocations throughout the Goulburn-Murray Irrigation District.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said often in this place, water management is one of the most complex issues facing the state government, but also the federal government. We need to look at what we do with our water management, with all of those farmers and all of those secondary users of water products, such as food and/or fibre. We need to have conversations about water with those people fairly and squarely in mind. We need to look at the damage that has been done to these communities in the name of better environmental outcomes, and we need to compare one against the other. We need to make sure that everybody who thinks, 'We have to avoid these fish kills at any cost,' realises that the cost may be that we will lose human lives if we're not careful. The chances are we probably already have. Making unattainable and simply unaffordable water that has always been plentiful, always been available and always been affordable for three, four and five generations of farmers has, without doubt, meant that farmers within northern Victoria and southern New South Wales have effectively taken their lives at the demise of their farms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to be honest; we need to be real. We all want a better environment. We all want healthier river systems. But we also have to be honest about the pain and the damage that has been caused as we have gone after these objectives. Therefore, when we get to a situation where the environmentalists cannot clearly enunciate the benefits associated with various environmental flows and various amounts of water being used for what, in many instances, have been absolutely ridiculous outcomes, such as trying to regrow the vegetation on the banks of the river that was lost by sending down too much water, a high flow of water, in the middle of winter—if this is the way we think we should spend $60 million worth of water—and then also throw in the added benefits of improving fish-breeding seasons, then I think we've got every right to question these assets, these environmental objectives and the practices that have been put in place to try to reach those objectives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I again want to congratulate the minister for this idea, this concept, of bringing an Indigenous person into the management process. Hopefully, that will have a really strong and positive outcome. We should always try to understand—to have even a basic understanding—that an enormous amount of pain and detriment has been caused by the amount of water that has left agriculture and been put into the environment, and we need to be very careful about how we proceed into the future.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KATTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>):  There have been a number of speakers who have referred to the Bradfield Scheme. I, along with one of the youngest and most brilliant doctorates ever awarded in universities in Australian history—they're a professor who wishes to remain anonymous—and a gentleman called Roy Stankey, one of the biggest sheep farmers in Queensland and one of the two smartest blokes I've ever known, drew up the revised Bradfield Scheme. Bradfield made three proposals. The first one: you dig a big, long tunnel—forget about that one; no-one's going to take that one seriously these days. The second one: you go through a break in the Great Dividing Range. There's no Great Dividing Range at a place called the Desert Uplands. The third one: you dig a canal up from Spencer Gulf and fill Lake Eyre that way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is most relevant to the Murray-Darling question is that the prevailing winds blow 32 million megalitres across the top of the Murray-Darling Basin. The Murray-Darling Basin has 23 million megalitres of run-off. This would blow 32 million megalitres across on top of the Murray-Darling Basin. Now, the gentleman who was proposing this was not exactly a fool. He built a bridge which is still the cornerstone of the traffic movements in Sydney. They said, 'You're building six lanes'—or eight lanes, I think it is—'and we've only got 25,000 cars in Sydney.' He said, 'We are building for the future.' He built the underground railway system, which is still the main means of transportation in Sydney, and he won the world prize for engineering. So the water supply to Sydney is still mainly the water supply that he built and engineered. He also built, in your own home city, Deputy Speaker Vasta, the Story Bridge and the University of Queensland, which your daddy, you and your brother, as I understand it, went to, as I did also. He also built that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The revised Bradfield Scheme says that you take the Bradfield Scheme and the waters where it rains all the time in the Kennedy electorate, which I represent. We get 200-inch rainfall at the Tullys, Babindas, Innisfails and Inghams, and you put a little tiny bit of that—because you only take the top of it right up in the mountains—and you put it back through to the other side of the Great Dividing Range, which we already do in Mareeba now. We take the Barron River and move it to the other side of the Great Dividing Range, and that's the Mareeba irrigation scheme. The Hells Gate Dam is stage 1. You take the water from the Burdekin, the third biggest river in Australia—the upper Burdekin—and you transfer it to that break in the Great Dividing Range. And then you go through onto the rolling, rich black soil plains, which used to have written across the map, 'The best natural grasslands in Australia.' It now grows 10 million hectares of prickly acacia trees, destroying all flora and fauna. When we die and go up to heaven, God will ask: 'What did you do? I gave you that beautiful asset. What did you do with it?' And we will say: 'We grew prickly trees on it.' We destroyed all of the possums, koala bears, kangaroos and dunnarts—the most endangered species in Australia. They were all destroyed by prickly trees because we sat on our backside and did nothing with the great asset that God had given us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were no bulldozers in the days of Bradfield. With bulldozers, it's quite attractive to build a giant canal and take and flood Lake Eyre with seawater. And the evaporation, as I said, is 32 million megalitres—the prevailing winds blow it up from the inside of the Great Dividing Range over the Murray-Darling Basin. Having read every report, there is no doubt in my mind that there will be a very, very significant increase in rainfall over the Murray-Darling Basin. But no-one in their right minds would take the waters from North Queensland and cross those magnificent, beautiful thousand-kilometre-wide and thousand-kilometre-broad rich black soil plains where you don't have to use fertiliser for eight years. We farm without using fertiliser, and there's the research farm there. Of course, we can then also use the waters of the Flinders River. We can't use that because there are just too many gaps to use it effectively. It's the sixth biggest river in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This magnificent scheme for the people of Australia, with the water going to Lake Eyre: how do you pay for it? If you take one per cent or two per cent of Lake Eyre—I can't remember which one it is—and you use it as a salt factory, it is the best salt factory in the world. It has nine metres of evaporation, and five per cent of salt water is salt, so you can work it out for yourself. That's a pretty big area, Lake Eyre. But that will virtually pay for the $5,000 million it costs. Wilson Tuckey used to be a great advocate for the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Indigenous side of it, it is very hard for me to contain my rage. In this place we apologised for the theft of the children, but we are thieving more children per capita today than we were doing then. And yet we had the enormous hypocrisy of this place—I had to fight to stop myself from walking out on the vote, or going public and calling a press conference. I claim to have a bit of Kalkatungu in the family tree. I'm dark and come from Cloncurry—you prove I'm not, but I most certainly identify, often and repeatedly. And under the law of course, legally, I am—that is, the law that was around a couple of hundred years ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will quote Greg Wallace, speaking as a First Australian. Greg is very famous because of the first time <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span> ever did a repeat program. He started Work for the Dole in Australia, an absolutely remarkable achievement. I was the minister and they all thought I had something to do with it. I didn't even know he'd done it until <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span> went off! He then got a second <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span>, the first time in the program's history. It was the most-watched program in Australia in those days, so he was a superstar. Gerhardt Pearson, Noel's brother, rang me up and said, 'Well, why don't we use the Work for the Dole money to build the houses?' Instead of building 400 houses, we built nearly 2,000 houses and we provided 720 jobs in the house-building program. These blokes were getting their dole money, but they were getting it topped up to a full wage as well by the state and federal government money that I was administering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what I want to say: look at the hypocrisy of this place in talking about putting a First Australian on the Murray-Darling Basin. I quote Greg Wallace: 'When I was CEO at Napranum, all of the CEOs in Cape York and the Gulf were blackfellas. Now they're all whitefellas. When I was CEO at Napranum, we had 36,000 head of cattle. Now we have none. When I was CEO at Napranum, we had 2,000 jobs—700 of them working in a highly-skilled area, building houses. Now we have none.' This government has cut off all housing money, but in any event there is no Work for the Dole scheme and the houses haven't been built by First Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All housing built in those days was built exclusively by local Indigenous labour. I doubt whether seven per cent of the workforce building the houses over the last 10 years was Indigenous labour, let alone local Indigenous labour. Let me go on with Greg's quote, 'We had water rights, we had quarrying rights and we had timber rights.' God bless the ALP, the champions of the First Australians! They took away our water rights, they took away our quarrying rights and they took away our timber rights. And, not content with that, they took away our right to have a beer! Everyone on earth can have a beer except we First Australians. All you whitefellas, you can drink, but we blackfellas, oh no—we can't be trusted to drink.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all drink. I know they had Prohibition in America, but it didn't stop anyone from drinking. In fact, the alcohol consumption actually went up, believe it or not! So we continue to drink. What has happened now is that we've all got criminal charges so we can't get a blue card, and the only jobs now, of course, are government jobs. There are no cattle, there is no house-building and there are no title deeds, so I can't take up a block of land and build a service station and own it myself, because there is no such thing as title deeds; they took them away from us as well. It's not really difficult; we issued 800 title deeds when I was minister. I pay respects to the very great Eric Laws, who just got an Order of Australia, and to the late Lester Rosendale, who is from what is probably the most prominent First Australian family in Cape York. His first cousins are Mattie Bowen, the famous rugby league player; Noel Pearson; and Greg Wallace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just go through this—oh, I haven't finished, I'm sorry! When Richard Mears was the chairman of the committee, we went up to the Torres Strait. We went to Masig Island and Showy Nona started screaming out, 'They're murdering us, Bobby!' He just kept shouting it out. And Richard Marles—I'm sorry; I got the name wrong, but I hope I got it right this time—said, 'What is he talking about?' I said: 'You banned by law all fruit and vegetable gardens in the backyards of every Torres Strait Islander family, just condemning them to death. They're going to die of malnutrition because they've got no fresh fruit and vegetables. By the time they get it up there, they've got no shelf life left, and they couldn't afford to buy it anyway. Not content with that, you banned dinghy fishing, which was the only commercial income which Torres Strait Islanders had.' They fought the battle, God bless the Torres Strait Islanders, and they got the rights back, but it's been 20 years since there's been a vegetable garden. They've forgotten how to put in a fruit and vegetable garden.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As for the dinghy fishing, all the freezers are gone from the 15 islands. You brought your catch in and sold it to the freezer, and that was your income. That was how we made a living in the Torres Strait, and that was taken away from us. We've got it back now, but the freezers are gone, so there's no use going fishing. There's no-one to sell it to, because there's no freezer to put the fish in. You go and put it in the fridge. We're talking about a huge amount of fish that you'll get from two or three blokes going out in a dinghy in a day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we sit here and talk about whether we should have representation on the Murray-Darling. We don't talk about 400 to 500 of us dying of malnutrition every year. That's not a figure plucked out of the air. That is the leading authority in university medical education in Australia—his figure, not mine. When I tried to get the figures on diabetes, the reaction of the Queensland government was: 'Oh, we love the black people. We're socialists; we love the black people.' Their reaction was not to fix the problem up but to hide the figures. For 2½ years they did a magnificent job of hiding the figures, but eventually I got them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our new Prime Minister has agreed to put market gardens in, but we've had no action and we must get action. Otherwise, people will think that we're just fibbers and noisemakers. We must put the market gardens back—and the much-maligned Christian churches.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a published historian. I wrote the bestselling non-fiction work in the year that it came out. It was launched—Murdoch press runs this, not me—by Kevin Rudd to over 1,000 people in Sydney. it was launched by Barrie Cassidy in Melbourne to over 1,000 people. I lived out bush with the last of the Kalkatungu. His mother was one of the few survivors of the battle, or the massacre, on battle range. We lived out bush together. We had mines together. I know I'm one of the very last vestiges of the knowledge of the old days. As a race of people, we must stand condemned, because that is how we're treating the First Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We come in here and talk about whether they have representation. We don't talk about giving them a title deed. We don't talk about giving them jobs. We don't talk about giving them back their rights to timber and water and quarrying, which they've had since time immemorial. When I say quarrying, I mean a lot of our implements, of course, were stone implements. Quarrying was a very valuable and important issue to us economically. To get a feed we need a tomahawk. To make a fire we needed that tomahawk. We had it for forever until now, and now we don't have it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the first movement I've seen in the years I have been down here, in spite of screaming, yelling, losing my temper and doing all sorts of wild and crazy things, has been from the current Prime Minister, and I would hope that, if there's a change of government in two or three years' time, it's continued by the Labor Party. But, at the present moment, we have not had action, and we must have action on the market garden issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My time is up, but all of the fruit and vegetables go to Brisbane and then back up to North Queensland. They lose two weeks of shelf life and then, by the time they get to the Torres Strait or Cape York, they're out shelf life. We've got nothing to eat of fresh fruit and vegetables and we're dying of malnutrition.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LITTLEPROUD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Water Resources, Drought, Rural Finance, Natural Disaster and Emergency Management</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:24</span>):  This is a historic day. In the gallery today there are a couple of First Australian members of the Murray-Darling Basin Community Committee with us, and I'm glad they are, because this has been a journey for me since before I was minister. I sat with a gentleman called Ronnie Waters in St George when I first became the member for Maranoa, and we talked about the Basin Plan, the consultation he had had and the lack thereof. The fact he didn't feel that he had a voice shocked me. One of the most respected traditional owners in the St George community had been disrespected. Today we are righting that wrong and making sure our First Australians have a voice—a strong voice at the table in the management of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the opposition in the bipartisan way that we have got here. I say also, particularly to the member for Watson, over the last 18 months, we've achieved a lot in the delivery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, particularly through the legislative framework that we put in place with the northern Basin review and the sustainable diversion limits. That would not have happened without the maturity and leadership from the member for Watson. And, while we didn't always agree, we always saw that it was important that we not only gave certainty to the 2.5 million Australians up and down the Basin but also included our First Australians. And in that agreement with the member for Watson we created a world-first $40 million Indigenous fund that now will be spent. Both the member for Watson and I refused to spend that until we could get a First Australian on the board. It would be inappropriate for us to start that program until such time as a First Australian is put on the board. Now, once the recruitment process is complete, that money will roll out to Indigenous communities up and down the basin for their economic and cultural benefit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also working with the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder to make sure Indigenous communities can map how the environmental flows are matched to those of the cultural flows. That's going to take time because it's about listening and that's what we haven't done so well in the past. So today we're changing that. We're going to make sure we get the outcomes for our First Australians that we expect for everyone else. Other speakers have talked about the economic hardship, which we will continue to do with the social and economic panel to investigate ways we can actually right that wrong, and it's important that our First Australians are brought with us as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is very important and I know, when it is put through to the Senate, we will have bipartisan support. From the process of finding the first board member of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, they will be someone not necessarily aligned to a particular area and will be someone who lives in the basin, who will represent all Indigenous Australians on the basin. It is a great honour and, to Ronnie Waters, it's as much about you and your story that I stand here today having the proud moment to move this bill. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  I rise to indicate Labor's support for the Combatting Child Sexual Exploitation Legislation Amendment Bill. I'm sure I speak for all in this place when I say that child sexual exploitation is absolutely abhorrent. Children are the most vulnerable members of our community and they deserve our protection and support. Labor is committed to protecting Australian children and has no tolerance for such heinous crimes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the House is an omnibus criminal justice bill targeted at child sexual exploitation. Labor strongly supports the objectives of this bill, which implements several recommendations of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, including by creating an offence of failure to protect a child at risk of a child sexual abuse offence, creating an offence of failure to report a child sexual abuse offence and strengthening overseas persistent child sexual abuse laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 33 of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse's criminal justice report stated that jurisdictions should introduce a criminal offence for failing to report child sexual abuse. To that end, the bill proposes a new offence for circumstances where a Commonwealth officer, who exercises care or supervision over children, knows of information that would lead a reasonable person to believe or suspect that another person has or will engage in conduct in relation to a child that constitutes a child sexual abuse offence and fails to disclose that information as soon as practicable to state police or the Australian Federal Police. Recommendation 36 in the royal commission's criminal justice report stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory governments should introduce legislation to create a criminal offence of failure to protect a child within a relevant institution from a substantial risk of sexual abuse by an adult associated with the institution—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill thus proposes a new offence in the Criminal Code for a Commonwealth officer who negligently fails to reduce or remove the risk of a child under their care, supervision or authority being sexually abused if it is part of their actual or effective responsibilities as a Commonwealth officer to reduce or remove that risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other measures contained in the bill form a suite of child protection measures which would criminalise the possession or control of child pornography material or child abuse material in the form of data that has been obtained or accessed using a carriage service; prevents certain dealings with childlike sex dolls and criminalise the possession of childlike sex dolls; improve the definition of forced marriage; and narrow the defence for overseas child sex offences based on a valid and genuine marriage between a defendant and a child.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm aware that some stakeholders raise concerns with aspects of the bill before the House. The Law Council expressed concern with regard to the application of the absolute liability for committing the offences created by the bill. As Labor's additional comments to the Senate inquiry noted, we accept the response of the Department of Home affairs and the Attorney-General's Department that application of absolute liability is 'appropriate to ensure compliance with the reporting regime'. In those same additional comments, Labor also indicated that it accepts the response of the two departments to a concern raised by the Law Council and by the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee regarding the bill's provision that an individual is not excused from failing to disclose information relating to child sexual abuse on grounds of possible self-incrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will watch the government's next steps closely, to ensure the bill is implemented as intended. Nonetheless, as I said at the start of my remarks, Labor supports this bill, and we strongly support its objective of protecting children from despicable acts of sexual exploitation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265967" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:33</span>):  In the recent and understandable political clamour regarding the financial services royal commission and the current aged-care and disability care royal commissions, it would be easy to lose focus on some of the urgent and critical recommendations outstanding from the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. I'm pleased to say that this government has not lost that focus. I acknowledge the committed work of the Minister for Home Affairs in ensuring that our coalition government continues to deliver on this most serious of matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to say that most of the measures in this bill are unlikely to be controversial. I think all of us are deeply disturbed and concerned about the growing trend of sex dolls designed to look like children, while the possession of child pornography, whatever its intended use, surely has no place in Australia. The possession of such materials, including such dolls, is a significant indirect encouragement to in person offending against a child and an affront to Australian values. This bill to prohibit them is timely and important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as important are the new offences relating to a failure to report in schedule 1. Thirty-two and a half per cent of child sexual abuse survivors heard by the royal commission said that their abuse took place in a government run institution. Eight per cent of all survivors were in youth detention and 31 per cent were in schools. These kinds of institutions are a particular risk. The royal commission found: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… children are more likely to be abused in institutional contexts where the community has an unquestioning respect for the authority of an institution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Though that cannot always be said of our political system, our schools and correctional services have enjoyed the public's respect. We must do all we can to reduce the risk of offending in these kinds of institutions. The majority of government institutions where abuse took place were operated by state and territory governments. However, not all of them were. For example, more than 100 survivors were abused in the armed services, and of course there were many offences which occurred within religious institutions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only a quarter of survivors heard by the royal commission disclosed their abuse at the time it occurred. One of the most important reasons for that non-disclosure was the fact that they did not expect to be believed. Twenty-six per cent of survivors who did choose to disclose as children retained that expectation. We must do all we can to give children confidence that if they report sexual offences not only will they be believed, but their complaints will be acted upon. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the royal commission found, in the absence of legal obligations many institutions and staff did not report abuse outside their institution. Schedule 1 will ensure that Commonwealth officers will face criminal sanctions if they fail to report such abuse. It will fulfil the intent of recommendations 33 and 36 of the royal commission's criminal justice report, and it will give greater confidence to those who wish to disclose. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak in particular about the provisions in schedules 5 and 6. Our relationships with other cultures and other nations rightly recognise that they have their own practices, their own norms and their own unique heritage. We celebrate that diversity. We seek to learn from one another and to work together on our shared interests and values. However, there are some practices that are fundamentally abhorrent and unacceptable, regardless of their historical standing in another culture. One such practice is forced underage marriages. Globally, around one in every seven girls aged 15 to 19 are married. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, four in 10 girls are married before the age of 18 and one in eight are married before they are 15. Not only can a girl under 16 not give her fully informed consent to a marriage, in violation of her accepted human rights, but it can have lasting impacts on intergenerational health and life prospects. Early marriage is associated with early child-bearing, which carries health risks for the mother and child, prevents women from accessing an education and increases the likelihood of intergenerational poverty and disadvantage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Though forced marriages are more prevalent overseas, unfortunately we know that they do involve many young Australians. Between the forced marriages ban in Australia in 2013 and the inaugural My Blue Sky conference on the topic last year more than 230 cases had been referred to the Australian Federal Police; however, there had been no prosecutions. At the My Blue Sky conference the AFP's Commander Lesa Gale described the significant barriers to prosecution of forced marriage, including the difficulty of obtaining evidence from other countries and the reluctance of victims, especially young victims, to give evidence against family members. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Australians, we believe that no-one under the age of 16 can consent to sexual activity, or by extension to marriage. As such it should be clear to us that any marriage undertaken by anyone under the age of 16 is, by that definition, a forced one. Schedule 5 of this bill helps us to meet that community expectation, as well as overcome some of the challenges in securing prosecutions by using that self-evident definition in the act. Under Schedule 5 of the bill we would no longer require as much evidence from overseas, nor the active co-operation of vulnerable and intimidated children. The simple fact of age, when established, will be sufficient for prosecution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Forced marriages are a particular concern in the context of travel for child sexual exploitation. As many as two million children are exploited in the commercial sex trade around the world, according to UNICEF. This is a particular problem in South-East Asia. An estimated 40,000 to 70,000 children in Indonesia are victims of sexual exploitation, and an estimated 100,000 children are trafficked every year. In total, more than half of all human trafficking and slavery victims in the world are located in the Asia-Pacific. Many of these are coerced into a forced or underage marriage. In 2016-17 more than 50 per cent of referrals received by the AFP on human trafficking were specifically with regard to those who are at risk of being moved abroad to take part in a forced marriage. It is big business. The trafficking industry, driven in part by forced marriages, generates $12 billion annually, according to the International Labour Organization. Unfortunately there are many in our own country who would seek to take advantage of this trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are estimated to be more than 20,000 registered child sex offenders in Australia, with around another 2,500 added every year. No doubt there are many more who commit child sex offences who are yet to be prosecuted. All too many, unfortunately, seek to travel to countries with weaker legal frameworks and enforcement to offend. Almost 800 Australian registered child sex offenders travelled overseas in 2016 alone. Let me say that again: almost 800 Australian registered child sex offenders travelled overseas in 2016 alone. Half of these were medium- to high-risk offenders. This government legislated last year to allow the cancellation of passports for many of these higher risk offenders. However, as I mentioned, not all who would attempt to sexually exploit a child are registered sex offenders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I met not long ago with a charity in my electorate, Destiny Rescue. Locally, they are based in Warana, but they operate in Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines, India and the Dominican Republic to rescue, rehabilitate and protect trafficked children. Working closely with the AFP, their international network of 400 active volunteers helped them successfully rescue over 3,000 trafficked children in 2018 alone. In Australia, Destiny Rescue is currently focusing on preventative education, because it continues to be the case that many of the men caught engaging in child sexual abuse offshore are Australian. Founder Tony Kirwan reports that he continues to see a large proportion of Australian men among those who visit South-East Asia's centres of child sexual exploitation. Currently, a number of those who travel for these purposes seek to bypass existing Australian laws against the child sexual exploitation overseas by entering into a forced marriage with a child. Schedule 6 of this bill will prevent such a marriage being used as a defence against Australian laws and will further deter offenders from travel for this very purpose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The need for a provision like this is significant. An International Labor Organization study in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, in 2011 interviewed 175 child sex workers. The ILO found children as young as 10 involved in commercial sex work. These children drank alcohol and many had been raped or physically abused. Some were HIV-positive and many had gone through pregnancies and abortions. In some countries, these 10-year-old children are legally permitted to marry, which currently affords Australians who would exploit them a possible legal defence.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedules 5 and 6 of this bill are very welcome and they are only the latest in a series of actions undertaken by the coalition government to deal with forced marriage and child sexual exploitation. Back in October 2016, the government announced the formation of a joint working group of Australian police and justice officials to combat child sex offenders and protect children in Australia and overseas. In November of the same year, at the eighth National Roundtable on Human Trafficking, we agreed to produce awareness-raising materials and establish feasibility studies for a code of conduct and public reporting of exploitation in supply chains. We've also announced the Bali Process Government and Business Forum to bring together the 48 Bali Process countries to create policies to tackle human trafficking and slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia we legislated Carly's law, the Criminal Code Amendment (Protecting Minors Online) Bill, which criminalises acts done online to prepare or plan to harm or engage in sexual activity with a child, while last year, among other measures, we passed the Passports Legislation Amendment (Overseas Travel by Child Sex Offenders) Bill. This allowed the government to deny registered sex offenders a passport, to prevent travel for exploitation, and formed the toughest regime against travel of this kind anywhere in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Domestically, the government fights forced marriages through a service called My Blue Sky, a website, helpline and legal advice service developed in partnership with Anti-Slavery Australia. I should note that if anyone following this debate is in a forced marriage or is concerned about being coerced in the future, or they know of someone or believe someone to be in that situation, they can visit www.mybluesky.org.au or telephone (02)95148115.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are few, if any, crimes that appal Australians as much as child sexual exploitation and abuse. The measures contained in this bill are practical, I hope uncontroversial, and, I believe, much needed to protect children both in our own country and overseas. I thank the Minister for Home Affairs for his continued dedication to this important battle. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:47</span>):  I rise to speak on the Combatting Child Sexual Exploitation Legislation Amendment Bill 2019 and say upfront that Labor strongly supports the objectives of this bill. This bill implements several recommendations of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, a royal commission that I'm particularly proud that Prime Minister Gillard initiated and that has done so much to shine a spotlight on horrific child abuse, historical and more recent. I say that as someone who is married to Lea, who basically has worked for 30 years in child protection, initially for 25 years or so as a child protection worker, a social worker, and then later as a lawyer for knowmore, the community legal service giving advice to the people who made submissions to the royal commission and, now, looking after those in the Redress Scheme. At home I've always been very aware of how crucial it is that Australia does all it can, that our states and territories do all they can, to combat child sexual exploitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill aims to protect children from sexual exploitation by strengthening the Commonwealth framework of offences relating to child abuse material, overseas child sexual abuse, forced marriage, failure to report child sexual abuse and failure to protect children from such abuse. The bill builds on the reforms and policies implemented under previous Labor and coalition governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud, as I said, to have been a member of the parliament in November 2012 when Prime Minister Gillard announced that she would recommend to the Governor-General that a royal commission be established to inquire into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. Former Prime Minister Gillard is actually in the building tonight—although on the other side of the building, where the red carpet is—and it's great to see that much of the legislative work she created via the royal commission is living on. Following that recommendation, Her Excellency Quentin Bryce, the then Governor-General, announced in January 2013 the six commissioners who would undertake the onerous task of conducting the inquiry. The inquiry was led by Justice Peter McClellan AM, who did incredible work. I'd also like to mention someone who I recommended—that is, former Queensland Police Commissioner Bob Atkinson. He got five minutes of retirement and then went onto the task of being one of the commissioners. Surely, Bob Atkinson is one of Queensland's finest for his work as a police officer on the Morcombe case, then as a police commissioner and then for his work on this royal commission. The workload on this commission was phenomenal. But I don't thank just Bob; I thank all the commissioners and their staff for the incredible work they did over five years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to make it clear, this work will leave scars. This work will leave a lasting imprint on the lives of all the commissioners and their staff. There was very, very disturbing evidence. Some of the de-identified stories I heard at home from my wife made me realise how incredibly tough the work of that royal commission was.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission received 42,041 phone calls. It received 25,964 letters and emails. The commissioners held 8,013 private sessions, and they made 2,575 referrals to authorities, including the police. This was not a royal commission that did not achieve outcomes—2,500 referrals to authorities! The royal commission handed down its final report in December 2017, and the commissioners made a total of 409 recommendations. This legislation before the House implements just a few of those recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 33 from the royal commission recommends that jurisdictions should introduce a criminal offence for failing to report child sexual abuse. This bill implements that recommendation by creating a new Commonwealth criminal offence for circumstances where a Commonwealth officer who exercises care or supervision over children knows of information that would lead a reasonable person to believe or suspect that another person has or will engage in conduct in relation to a child that constitutes a child sexual abuse offence and fails to disclose that information as soon as practicable to state police or the Australian Federal Police. So, it puts that positive onus on people to step up rather than wilfully close their eyes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 36 from the royal commission recommends that state and territory governments introduce legislation to create a criminal offence for the failure to protect a child within an institution from a substantial risk of sexual abuse by an adult associated with the institution. If you remember the evidence, we heard from all sorts of institutions—sporting clubs, boarding schools, swim schools. Obviously this bill can't implement that exact recommendation, but it does take the substance of that recommendation and creates a new Commonwealth criminal offence for a Commonwealth officer who negligently fails to reduce or remove the risk of a child under their care, supervision or authority being sexually abused if it is part of their actual or effective responsibilities as a Commonwealth officer to reduce or remove that risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also strengthens the laws for overseas persistent child sexual abuse. Currently a conviction for criminal persistent sexual abuse of a child overseas requires proof of at least three underlying occasions. The bill will require the minimum number of underlining occasions of abuse that have to be proved to be two. The bill will also criminalise the possession of a child-like sex doll, making such a doll child abuse material for the purposes of the Criminal Code and Customs Act. And a new offence will be created for the possession or control of child abuse material in the form of data held on a computer or contained in a data storage device that was obtained or accessed by a carriage service, thus bringing the Commonwealth in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More particularly when you consider we're a multicultural community with people coming from all around the globe, the definition of forced marriage will be expanded. The current definition of forced marriage relies on the absence of consent. Prosecuting forced marriage involving children has been inherently difficult as the victims have on their own evidence demonstrated that they have understood the nature and effect of the marriage ceremony. The bill will expand the definition of forced marriage to include all marriages involving children under 16 years of age.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also addresses the abhorrent practice of Australian offenders travelling overseas to abuse and exploit children. These vile individuals target countries that have weak or weaker child protection frameworks and where the offending is less likely to attract attention. This bill will amend the defence contained in the Criminal Code so that the existence of a marriage between the offender and a child will not constitute a defence if the child is under the age of 16.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the first time this legislation or legislation very similar to this was introduced into parliament. A similar bill was introduced into the 45th Parliament but did not actually make its way to the Senate. The bill lapsed at the dissolution of the 45th Parliament, unfortunately. The previous bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and actual concerns were raised about that bill that focused on the mandatory sentencing part of that bill. Importantly, the mandatory sentencing provisions have been removed and are not included in the bill currently before the House. Obviously, the concerns about mandatory sentencing are that, because of the severity of a crime being inflicted on a person, you might not end up with a conviction before the court, as all the evidence shows.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be noted that some stakeholders did raise serious concerns with aspects of the bill. I particularly point out that the Law Council expressed concern with regard to the application of absolute liability for committing certain offences created by the bill, and Labor's additional comments to the Senate inquiry accept the response of the Department of Home Affairs and the Attorney-General's Department that the application of absolute liability in these very limited circumstances is appropriate to ensure compliance with the reporting regime established by this legislation. However, I point out that the Labor senators also make clear that the operation of those provisions should be closely monitored following the enactment of this bill. The senators also accepted that it is appropriate for an individual not to be excused from failing to disclose information relating to child sexual abuse, on the ground that doing so might incriminate the individual. Such an abrogation of the privilege against self-incrimination, which has been around for 500 years or so, is not something that should be done lightly. But in the report the Labor senators ultimately accepted that in these very limited circumstances it was necessary to do so to ensure that the reporting requirements introduced by this bill are effective and the operation of those previsions would be closely monitored to see how they play out, because it is a drastic change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, we do so because all 227 senators and MPs in this place would agree that child sexual exploitation is abhorrent. Children are the most precious and vulnerable members of our community. They deserve our protection and support. Labor is committed to protecting Australian children, and there is nothing more sickening than child sexual exploitation. As I mentioned at the start, I'm married to someone who has spent their whole life fighting that, so I've heard about it so often. Labor has no tolerance for these crimes, and any claims otherwise are completely misleading. I do remember a former Western Australian MP suggesting that. Thankfully, he is no longer in this parliament, but I will never forgive him for suggesting so at that despatch box. Thankfully, he is not here now, because it really stuck in my craw, considering the amount of my life that I've devoted to combating that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, Labor strongly supports the objectives of this bill, which implements several recommendations of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse—a royal commission that the Labor Party initiated—and builds on these reforms and policies implemented under Labor governments and then the coalition. Labor will watch the government's next steps closely to ensure that the bill is implemented as intended and that all of those royal commission recommendations, as much as possible, are rolled out. But, fundamentally, Labor supports the measures in the bill and will support it, and I commend it to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:59</span>):  There is very little that sickens me more than the prospect of child sexual abuse, it must be said. It is one of the most heinous crimes and it is right that we should move to harden up the stance of the laws in Australia against people who would even contemplate such behaviour. We have had the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse and, quite rightly, that royal commission has handed down a list of recommendations, many of which are being addressed in this legislation. One would hope that the spotlight being shone on institutional abuse has led to a great decline in it. Of course, we have fewer children in institutions in any case in this day and age. But it would seem to me that, while we may be improving in that area, in the general public, in non-institutionalised areas, the incidence of child sexual abuse and other abuses seems to be on the rise. So, while we might be saying we are cleaning up one part of our society, it feels as though we're losing ground on another and we need to send a strong message from this place that it will not be tolerated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I get onto the legislation, it does make me reflect on the modern environment and the proliferation of pornography generally—even soft pornography. If you turn on the television on a Saturday morning, you will see music video clips which are sexually explicit and are clearly aimed at children. I mean, is it any surprise that they grow up into adults who are less than savoury with poor judgement in these areas? I'm not a psychologist. I'm not a scientist who can prove the link, but it seems to me, as someone who sees themselves as a middle Australian, it is hard to deny that that type of thing should be influencing people. Some violent video games are so horrific, so life-like now. Where do the lines stop blurring for some people?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think with this legislation we're doing the right thing, but in time this parliament is going to have to bring itself to address some of these other issues. Children are being exposed, as I said, at younger and younger ages to more explicit material. We defend the rights of adults to behave in any manner they wish so long as it doesn't impact on other individuals, and that's a good enough position to take. But if behaviour behind closed doors is actually influencing their behaviour beyond the closed doors—and who's to say it's not—then perhaps we need to intervene in that area as well. I will sound like some 19th-century censorship agent here, but we just cannot turn a blind eye to what is happening around us and sort of deny cause and effect. I just put those remarks in there because I think that is something that we are going to have to consider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To come to the legislation: one of the things it will do is make it an offence to turn a blind eye, to walk past the crime. As we know, many people in public positions, particularly in schools, have had mandatory reporting for some time, quite rightly. Well, this legislation puts mandatory reporting on everybody's back. If you're aware of a child being abused and you do not act on it, if you don't notify police, if you don't move to do something to intervene—don't put your own life in jeopardy—or make it known then you'll be committing an offence, I think, quite rightly. I'll only be able to paraphrase it but, whoever it was who said the crime we walk by is the one we tolerate, the one we endorse, was completely right. It strengthens laws, quite rightly again, against Australians sexually abusing children overseas. This is really difficult to police. When you think about it, what a low, miserable act it is, to go somewhere where people are poor and take advantage of their children, abuse them and leave them in a pile of rubble in a distant country. It's simply not good enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also seeks to change the language, the way that we refer to these events. Possessing child pornography will disappear as an offence. It will be known as child abuse material. We'll call it for what it is. Hopefully, that will continue to raise the public ire and public intolerance of this type of behaviour. The bill will alter the language around forced marriage. It tightens the definition and also attempts to reach overseas, so that Australians that may be involved in forced marriages offshore will be committing offences as well. It's worth reading one of the subsections that apply here. A marriage is forced if it's entered into without full and free consent 'because of the use of coercion, threat or deception' or 'because the victim was incapable of understanding the nature and effect of the marriage ceremony'—and the explanatory memorandum says in brackets 'for reasons such as age and mental capacity'. Subsection 270.7A(4) provides that a person under 16 years of age is presumed, unless the contrary is proven, to be incapable of understanding the nature and effect of the marriage ceremony.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend that language. I commend the process behind that bill. Last year there were 18,000 reports of child exploitation in Australia. It really makes one blanch, doesn't it:18,000 reports last year. As the Prime Minister has noted, 28 per cent of child sex offenders convicted federally did not spend a day in jail. I wonder whether we're already committing an offence under this act by turning a blind eye and walking past the offence. I don't think that's good enough. I don't think any caring parent thinks it's good enough. I certainly don't want people who would commit those kinds of acts living next door to my children or grandchildren. I'm sure no other caring parent does. So we ramp up the penalties, we ramp up the language, we attempt to influence public opinion and to come out more strongly in defence of those that are most defenceless in our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will make the possession of childlike sex dolls a criminal offence. I note that there has been some debate in the newspapers about therapeutic sex dolls and whatever. Maybe, but I struggle to be convinced. I don't know what makes a huge difference between a childlike one and an adultlike one. I don't like either of them, quite frankly, but we are moving in this area, as we should. This bill also will criminalise online dealings in child abuse material; that is, the transmission, distribution, accessing or soliciting of material. Once again, so it should.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to implement many of the recommendations of the royal commission. As I said, while not every member of parliament may speak on it, I think there would be 151 members of this House that certainly support the views that are put forward in this bill, and I would assume there will be 76 senators in the other place. We should all abhor child sexual abuse. I strongly commend this bill to the House. We should work together to try to stamp out this abomination.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:09</span>):  I rise to speak on the Combatting Child Sexual Exploitation Legislation Amendment Bill 2019. I'd like to echo many of the comments made by the member for Grey. Everything he said I agree with, which is not something that happens with every member in this House. Everything he said is absolutely correct. I commend the government's work on this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill implements a number of recommendations from the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. All of the proposed measures are aimed at protecting children and punishing individuals who fail to protect a child at risk of sexual abuse. Any abuse of children, irrespective of whether the offending occurs in an institution or on an online platform, is abhorrent. It is sickening. But one aspect of this offending that I found particularly troubling and disturbing is the use of childlike sex dolls. Childlike sex dolls are an increasingly emerging form of child exploitation material that must clearly be criminalised to prevent children from being abused as the dolls normalise abusive behaviour towards children, encourage the sexualisation of children and increase the likelihood that a paedophile will engage in sexual activity with or towards children. It is important that all states and territories, not just the Commonwealth, move quickly to ban the use of these repulsive objects, which are three-dimensional—they are lifelike; they resemble children—and are intended to be used for the simulation of sexual intercourse. It's disturbing that there is a market for such an object. It's equally disturbing that there are manufacturers willing to create this product.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My SA-BEST colleagues in the South Australian parliament have already introduced the Criminal Law Consolidation (Child-Like Sex Dolls Prohibition) Amendment Bill 2019 into the South Australian Legislative Council. The bill, modelled on the Commonwealth legislation that we are debating in the chamber this evening, proposes amendments to the Criminal Law Consolidation Act to include childlike sex dolls within the definition of child exploitation material. While it could be argued that childlike sex dolls could already fall within the existing definition, this remains untested in South Australia. In addition, the SA-BEST bill makes it an offence to produce or disseminate childlike sex dolls, with a penalty of 10 years imprisonment applying to the offence. The bill also makes it an offence to possess a childlike sex doll. A person guilty of such an offence will face 10 years imprisonment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill passed the South Australian Legislative Council earlier this evening, and I understand it passed with the support of the government and the opposition—and I'm very pleased to see bipartisan support for this bill that is before us tonight. I would like to take the opportunity to thank the Hon. Connie Bonaros MLC and her team for their efforts in strengthening the protections for children in South Australia. Centre Alliance stands alongside SA-BEST, resolute in our commitment to prevent the exploitation of children. This bill and the bill before the South Australian parliament fall within that commitment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am the parent of three beautiful, wonderful children, one of whom is now an adult. Children are so incredibly vulnerable, and when a child is abused their childhood is gone. I am very pleased that, in this place today, we are taking some very positive steps that go some way to addressing some of the wrongs done to children, and to right some of those wrongs. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="72184" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GILLESPIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:13</span>):  I rise in wholehearted support for the Combatting Child Sexual Exploitation Legislation Amendment Bill 2019, and I would like to endorse the comments of previous speakers. Unfortunately, child abuse is a scourge on society. In my adult life I have been involved in this area, particularly in the last seven or eight years, because of my involvement, in the Port Macquarie region, with the wonderful Bravehearts organisation—which is dedicated to educating, empowering and protecting our most vulnerable, our children—and because of my work in the portfolio of children and families. I've been involved with rolling out the Redress Scheme in the children and families portfolio. The overwhelming impression is that this scourge is far more common than most people realise, and these omnibus bill recommendations and changes to the law will strengthen the framework within which the Australian Commonwealth addresses child sexual abuse both here and overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the recommendations in the royal commission have already come into force. The redress scheme is now up and running. But this bill also implements and creates new offences—an offence of either failing to protect a child at risk of a child sexual abuse event and an offence if you fail to report. As the member before me, the member for Mayo, said, the failure to report to the authorities knowledge of a child sexual offence makes you as guilty as the person who's doing it, because you're tolerating it by not reporting it. It also strengthens the legislation and offences about overseas persistent child sexual abuse, because the persistent cases of child sexual abuse, particularly by people in positions of authority, are often the hardest to prove. So we've got changes in there to make it easier for the victim and make the likelihood of a prosecution greater. There are a range of measures to expand what is illegal in child exploitation both here in Australia and overseas. It also, as I said, enhances the protection outcomes and makes prosecutions a lot easier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also addresses some glaring gaps, criminalising the control and possession of child pornography material or child abuse material that's come over a carriage service. As you know, Deputy Speaker, online abuse is much more common than we realise. These changes are addressing that by making it a criminal offence to transmit, receive or store such digital evidence of child abuse. The bill also addresses and prevents certain dealings with childlike sex dolls and criminalises the possession of childlike sex dolls. It struck me as another shocking reality that people get these pornographic dolls as a means of normalising and encouraging child sexual abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue that this bill is addressing is forced marriage, which happens both here in Australia and overseas. The bill introduces a new criminal code for Commonwealth officers if they are in a position of power and they fail to report or prevent a child sexual abuse event occurring, particularly if it is part of their actual or effective responsibilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing is possession or control of child pornography material. The bill introduces tests that make it a lot easier to prosecute. As I mentioned, in cases of persistent child sexual abuse the authorities have found, particularly with young, vulnerable people who have been abused over and over again, that it all blurs in the mind of a young person. In these provisions we have changed the requirement so that they need only to prove that the abuse happened twice rather than thrice. Before that, it was even harder.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going to the issue of forced marriages, there are many valiant legal organisations trying to prevent forced marriages both here in Australia and in Asia and other overseas destinations. A lot of people use forced marriages as an excuse for committing child sexual abuse, but these amendments cause it to be an offence to enter into a forced marriage or be party to a forced marriage. A marriage is defined as being forced if it's entered into without full and free consent because of the use of coercion, threat or deception, or if the victim has an incapacity to understand the nature and effect of the marriage ceremony, for reasons such as age. The age under which that knowledge and understanding is presumed is 16. A person under the age of 16 is presumed to be incapable of understanding the nature and effect of the marriage ceremony. As I mentioned, the legislation also expands the rebuttable presumption and expands the definition of forced marriage to explicitly include all marriages involving children under 16. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This change to the law will make it a lot easier for the poor child victim. It reduces the need to call evidence from the vulnerable child victim, and it simplifies the prosecutorial burden. All of this is really important. I have seen what has happened to people who have suffered child abuse. Unfortunately, I've seen so many school friends whose lives have been turned upside down as a result of what happened when they were young and naive. I dealt with cases when I was assistant minister in the Children and Families portfolio and through my involvement with Bravehearts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The main thing is that this is an all-encompassing attempt to close a lot of loopholes so that Australians who do travel overseas don't abuse children under the cover of forced marriages, with lax law enforcement and child protection structures in place. It means that we can catch Australians who are doing these horrible things overseas. All in all, it is a great outcome that this bill has so much support across the aisles, and I'm sure it will have equal support in the other place. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FALINSKI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:22</span>):  I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on this incredibly important bill, the Combatting Child Sexual Exploitation Legislation Amendment Bill 2019. It has been a number of years since the Commonwealth parliament came to a view that it was important for us to extend our purview over people who were plying their evil trade of abusing minors to countries outside Australia. It was an important step, because they were using the reach of this parliament and parliaments in other parts of Australia to try and get outside the net of the will of the people. As a father of a daughter, it is quite extraordinary that anyone would behave in such a manner and form. These reforms are critical to sending a clear message to people who would use this type of activity to create a situation where they feel they could get away with it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen in other jurisdictions that minimum mandatory sentencing sends a clear signal to perpetrators of all types of crimes that it is unacceptable and they will not be able to get through the court system or to somehow convince people that they should not be punished in a relevant and systemic fashion. When such measures have been introduced, what we have found is that those crimes have reduced quite massively and quite substantially. This bill makes it quite clear that we are going to be in a position where such people will not be able to go overseas and will not be able to subvert the will of this parliament and the people of Australia. This is important for many reasons. Yesterday, we had World Suicide Prevention Day. It is amazing, the number of people who commit suicide because of events that occurred earlier in their lives. In some cases, they have denied that those events ever occurred, but later in life they find themselves in the situation where they simply cannot deal with those events.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Preventing this sort of crime against children is, I think, one of the most important things that any parliament can do. I say, as the parent of a daughter, it is difficult to imagine a better way to harm any parent than to abuse their child—especially in situations where there are people in places of trust. That is, they've been given an opportunity to look after children and that instead of using that position as they should, undertaking care and diligence to ensure that the child is protected, they betray the trust that has been placed in them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot, in any circumstances, underestimate the enormity of the betrayal. This parliament is right to send a most extraordinary signal—in fact, there is probably no signal that we could send that is extraordinary enough—to say to people in that position that if they abuse the child who they are meant to be protecting, then the weight of the law will come down upon them without mercy because they have shown the most vulnerable in our community no mercy. We don't care where that happens. They can try to ply their evil trade in other parts of the world, but the long arm of the Australian law will find them, will prosecute them and will punish them for this crime that they have committed. There is nothing more serious than injuring a person for life in a manner and form that does not allow them to live their lives to their greatest possibilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From time to time I reflect on the number of people who have committed suicide later in life, who were unable to continue a full life because of the scars—the mental distress—that they had suffered due to the abuse that they had to endure as children. How many great people have our communities lost because we were unable in that time and place to look after them in a manner and form that we should have? That is why I believe that this particular piece of legislation will be passed by this parliament unanimously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Mayo also spoke of the damaging effects of normalising aberrant behaviour, as we see with child sex dolls. It is important that this parliament, as the Attorney-General has done, recognises the harm that these dolls can do and recognises that it is almost like a ramp-up to committing a crime. It's important that we stop these things now, before they come and do harm and damage to others. This is not a trivial matter; this is in fact quite the opposite. It is a very serious matter, and it is right that this parliament recognises that. We need to take the opportunity at this point in time to say very clearly to people who think that it's okay that it's not okay; that this House, the people's House, recognises that the behaviour of people who think that it's okay is not okay, and that if they try to do that the law of this land will very clearly be brought down upon their heads.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are, obviously, other matters that we should look at very seriously as well. This bill, like all bills of this nature, must take account of circumstances as they evolve. It is important that we continue to recognise that while we may believe there is no other way for people who wish to perpetrate this crime to do so, inevitably there will be people who try to find ways around this law. In those circumstances, it is important that this parliament be very strong in the manner and form that it responds to those opportunities.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  As the new shadow minister for defence industry, I'm thoroughly enjoying learning about Australia's defence capability and the potential for businesses around the country to increase our defence industry offerings to both the Australian and overseas defence markets. I look forward to working with these businesses to improve their opportunities in the defence industry space. However, understanding the defence industry requires an understanding of the primary user—the Australian Defence Force. I have been lucky now to have had two opportunities to spend extended time with our defence personnel in various operations and exercises. I believe it is vital to connect with these individuals, from those with stars down to those without a commission, to find out firsthand what they do, what they use and work with every day, what works and, sometimes, what doesn't to find out what it is that we can do as their elected representatives to support them and ensure the protection of our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first opportunity I had to be exposed to the reality of defence deployment was in 2017, when I travelled to the Middle East and Afghanistan. This gave me a valuable initial insight into the lives of the men and women of our defence forces on deployment, their living conditions, their experiencing long periods away from loved ones, weather extremes and life in body armour. Being over there, we had the opportunity to learn of their experiences on the ground and witness what they deal with day in, day out. Our Navy, Army and Air Force do an incredibly challenging job in often very difficult circumstances, circumstances that are unlike any other, so it is important, I believe, that we don't just support them in words and practice but take the time to get the understanding of their service, their work, their operations, their jobs, and the effects on them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In July of this year, I had the opportunity through the ADF parliamentary program to take part in exercise Talisman Sabre in Queensland, the principle biennial Australian and US military training exercise that combines our Navy, Army and Air Force in high-end war fighting. It is the main exercise between Australia and the US and integrates our regional ally, Japan, as well as troops from Britain and New Zealand. Overall, there were more than 30,000 troops, sailors, airmen and women involved in the exercise, and I had the opportunity to witness them at work in a very difficult setting. During the week I spent on the exercise, I had the opportunity not only to visit but to steer the HMAS<span style="font-style:italic;"> Canberra</span>—don't worry, it was only for a minute or two! I was so impressed with the capacity of the crew, how young yet confident they all were in their roles. I had the opportunity to witness the largest amphibious vehicle landing, where 2,000 personnel descended upon the shores of Stanage Bay. We travelled in Chinooks, sat in on special operation meetings and had the opportunity to experience night vision goggles and the ADF's new binoculars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People may think that North Queensland is quite balmy all year round and, for the most part, they would be correct. What people tend to forget is the significant drop in temperature that occurs overnight, particularly when you are camping out under the stars. I cannot complain. All of the personnel who took part certainly didn't, even when we were eating ration packs. Special thanks I must give to those who shared their special recipes for those packs! In fact the only negative peep I heard was when the Americans were tasked with the age-old potentially relationship-destroying mission of testing our unique delicacy, Vegemite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being involved in the exercise was an amazing opportunity. It is through my participation in the Talisman Sabre exercise that I can further appreciate both the might of our defence capability as well as the personal sacrifice and commitment that comes with that. I got to learn of the issues experienced in the field and how new protections and capabilities will further enhance the effectiveness of our forces and improve the service of our ADF personnel. I want to thank all of the ADF personnel who enabled my visit. I have nothing but respect and admiration for our ADF members and our allied forces. The ADF's amazing capability and interoperability with other forces was truly a sight to behold. Australians can be very proud of our defence personnel and I thank all those who made my trip an enjoyable, educational and productive one.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="279991" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  One of my declared objectives in representing the federal seat of Cowper is to address the national average rates of youth unemployment in the electorate. Over a number of years of youth unemployment data, the Coffs Harbour and Grafton local government areas, combined, have seen double the national average youth unemployment rate. There is a similar situation with the township of Kempsey. Last year, when I was preselected as the Nationals candidate for Cowper, youth unemployment in Coffs Harbour reached 23.3 per cent. I made a commitment to the electorate then to take steps to change the picture for our youth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm happy to say that, last Saturday, I met with a very enthusiastic and motivated group of local experts: a leading school principal, a careers adviser, a chamber of commerce president, a head of local youth services, a leading employer, a NSW Business Chamber regional representative and a youth training provider. We all came together to share ideas, to offer solutions and to develop a platform for a youth employment summit to be held early in the new year to bring all of the best minds to bear on this challenge and to give youth themselves a voice on pathways forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are looking at solutions that increase cooperation, communication and knowledge-sharing between employers, training organisations and community organisations. We've identified strengths in the local TAFE and university and want to work on developing links around recognising qualifications. Employees are seeking out universities, TAFE and the VET sector in order to better match employment available in our region. For example, we have a significant aged population and huge investment in aged-care housing developments and we need to do better to match these jobs with suitable qualifications. We also need to better embrace the many and varied talents and skills of our migrant population, especially the new members of the community and students with diverse language skills. We need to establish mentor training relationships with employers and with youth, taking advantage of the huge diversity of business in the area. We want to investigate the incorporation of on-the-job training into large community and infrastructure projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to forge greater connections between the community and youth. We need to find ways to promote a culture of caring for youth and connect them to community leaders and mentors. Mentors are such an effective strategy for so many personal development challenges. We want to develop more mentoring opportunities from community services, experienced professionals and successful business owners. An initiative has already started at local schools where students are encouraged to find themselves a school based mentor and an external mentor. This provides them with valuable interaction to support their aspirations, set targets and reach goals. We could perhaps ask business to adopt a 'pay it on or pay it forward' approach to share success and resilience through mentoring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We identified that senior students need more and improved information about post-school options and choosing between tertiary education and trade and service careers. We need to promote and increase the number of school based traineeships to capture students before they leave school without employable skills. We need to get more businesses involved in school based training and more in-work experience programs for year 10 students, and we need to motivate employers to participate as well. We need to better support students interested in apprenticeships through simple things like information and support with applications, while at the same time helping employers connect with the various apprenticeship incentive schemes and making it easier for them to take on apprentices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The youth employment summit we are planning in the new year will bring together all those with skin in the game: the youth, employers, schools, training organisations and community service organisations. We want to hear from the youth. We want to know what they think can help. We want to hear from the employers what they're looking for. I'm sure members from both sides of this House have engaged in projects which have helped address youth unemployment problems and I would welcome your input.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I urge all residents in Cowper who want to see our youth fulfil their potential to be part of the youth employment summit.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="101351" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  Hundreds of people in my electorate of Wills have met with me, written to me and called me about the Tamil family—Priya, Nadesalingam and their two Australian-born children, Kopika and Tharunicaa—who've made their home in Biloela in Queensland. A lot has been said about this family and why they should stay in Australia. Overwhelmingly, the people in my electorate who've contacted me want this family, whose children have known no other home but Australia, to stay. I also believe that the minister should use his ministerial discretion for this family—after all, the Minister for Home affairs and the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs have both intervened and used their ministerial discretion in hundreds of cases to allow people to stay in Australia, from au pairs working illegally to other asylum seeker cases. We've heard the argument—and we've heard it from the other side—that allowing this family to stay will create a backdoor or will open up the floodgates. The reality is that this ministerial discretion has been used again and again and we have not seen a flood of au pairs. The government's policies are built on this deterrence which involves cruelty. This is the path the government has chosen to take.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've always argued that there are other ways and that we support other ways. We stand against the government's policy of indefinite detention. We want to see people processed safely, with their dignity and human rights upheld, as quickly as possible. We stand against this government's delays in processing the applications of some 30,000 people nationally and their cruel removal of all the safety nets, including income support, legal aid, counselling and casework, which would be available to them while they have their asylum claims assessed. We developed a series of policies on this and have been very public in articulating them. One is ending indefinite detention on Manus and Nauru. Labor took to the last election a policy to double the annual refugee intake. I myself co-sponsored a community sponsored refugee program which would have added 5,000 places per year under community sponsorship. We committed $500 million to the UNHCR. We will restore the 90-day rule in processing. We called for an independent children's advocate. For refugees in our community already, we would end both the temporary protection visas and the safe haven enterprise visas, the TPVs and the SHEVs, and move people to permanent protection if they are found to be genuine refugees. That means a right to family reunion. It means a start to building a life here in Australia that is legitimate. Of course, we would also abolish the fast-track process and restoring the Status Resolution Support Services welfare funding which is so important for families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond even these policies, we should look further to our role in responding to the global refugee crisis, a role that this government has resiled from. Australia is a successful, multicultural nation, and we should be world leaders, as we have been in generations past, in welcoming refugees. I believe that Australia can and should again be a global leader in the response to the global refugee crisis. History shows us a way forward. In the 1970s and 1980s Australia welcomed refugees from South-East Asia, but for the most part they didn't come by boat. Between 1975 and 1982, almost 70,000 refugees from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia resettled in Australia. Of those, only 2,000 people came directly to Australia by boat. The rest, the vast majority, came by plane after their claims were processed in Asia through regional agreements that had been entered into.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a return to that sort of coordinated international effort. We need an international agreement where 10, 20 or 30 refugee-taking countries commit to taking more refugees, but do so on a consistent basis so that we can start to really address the global refugee crisis. I spoke about this in my first speech to this place, and I have been advocating for this idea ever since. I've obviously done some policy work in this space. It is an ambitious goal, but the scale of the crisis that we face globally calls for ambition. If we want to live in a safe and peaceful region, we need to move beyond this toxic, domestic debate, the fear based debate, and step up and lead as a nation. It's not just the right thing to do; it's in our interests as a nation to do so.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="56430" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DRUM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  For many months now it's been apparent that in places like the Goulburn Valley, that I represent, there is a real difference when it comes to our labour force and ability to get appropriate labour than in most other regions throughout Australia. Whilst we do have five per cent unemployment, we have at least more than five per cent of jobs that are available. Our biggest problem in the region is that there is a whole raft of employment opportunities and sectors that are not able to get the labour that they are looking for. It has caused the councils from around the Goulburn Valley to band together to try and reach an agreement, known as a DAMA. This agreement is to try and get that special opportunity to bring in from overseas the labour that we need. We need a genuine understanding that, whether in the agricultural sector or the processing sector, or in steel fabrication or aged care, there is a whole raft of jobs where people in the cities—in Melbourne and Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide—would easily be able to fill those roles but out in regional Australia, in dynamic cities, those positions are nearly impossible to fill. We need people in Melbourne and Sydney to understand that in the regions, if we are going to drive our Australian businesses forward, we need to be able to access overseas workers. We have a range of opportunities to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the backpackers arrangement, where our tourists can come in and make money and then spend that money in Australia. In the Goulburn Valley we open our arms to the backpackers. We also have the Seasonal Worker Program, which is partly to help us get our fruit off the trees. It's also very much a humanitarian program that enables many of our neighbouring Pacific Island nations to send their workers out to Australia where they are able to be of fantastic benefit to us in the regions that grow fruit and they are able to make some significant money to send home to their families. They are also able to return home after six or nine months of work, spend time with their families and then come back, quite often, to the same farm the following year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have an opportunity to expand upon the two-year visas and the four-year visas for the skills shortages. These opportunities also need to be encouraged because, again, they offer some of the only opportunities that our Australian businesses have in the Goulburn Valley—and right throughout regional Australia. I don't think the Goulburn Valley is that different to many other dynamic regions around Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to get away from the concept that if we bring somebody in from overseas to fill a role in a given sector that somehow or other we're taking away a job from an Australian. Already we have so many businesses that are advertising and advertising and trying and trying to get those jobs filled from within Australia, but to no avail. We can't just get on our high horse and say we're not going to engage with some of these countries which offer a fantastic workforce—whether it be the Philippines, Vietnam or Malaysia. They've got an amazing record of being able to provide the workers that we need to take our Australian businesses forward to another level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly, most of our abattoirs around the nation are going at about 66 per cent to 70 per cent of capacity. They're all roughly in the same boat, primarily because they cannot get the work to actually take their businesses to the level that they have the demand for. We have our food processing. We have some rather highly qualified roles, such as food technicians—a role that needs a university degree. It's very difficult to get people to come into the regions in the role of a food technician because we simply can't attract those people into the regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, there are some of these other jobs—motor mechanics and diesel mechanics. When I was growing up all of my mates were in those types of roles and filled those jobs with great pride, yet, right now, some of leading motor garages and truck garages in the Goulburn Valley are struggling to get the people that they need to fill those roles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I'm asking the ministers, including Minister Coleman, to do everything they can to assist places like the Goulburn Valley, the Campaspe Shire, the City of Greater Shepparton and the Moira Shire. We're banding to try to get our special arrangement and a DAMA to help fix our labour problem.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AMR" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CATHERINE KING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  This year over 19,000 Australian men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer. Twenty-five per cent of all men who receive a dreaded cancer diagnosis from their doctor will have prostate cancer. 3,500 Australian men are taken from their loved ones by this disease each year. That is, nine men in Australia die from prostate cancer every single day. No cancer affects more Australian men than prostate cancer, and when it strikes it is either deadly or life altering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite its prevalence and the fact that one in seven Australian men will receive a diagnosis at some point in their lives, we don't hear much about it. In fact more people die each year of prostate cancer than breast cancer; but while we all, women and men, know the risks and warning signs of breast cancer, I'm sure we could not say the same of prostate cancer. That's why the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia is working to change that. One of the ways it does that is through the Big Aussie Barbie that so many of us in this place attended today. This year is the 10th anniversary of the Big Aussie Barbie, and it will reach more Australians, raise more awareness and bring in more funds than ever. For 10 years Australians have been coming together for a very good cause. This year the barbecue has already exceeded its fund-raising target by over 30 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Later this week I will be adding my support to this great cause with a barbecue hosted at my electorate office. Coming along to the barbecue will be members of the Ballarat Prostate Cancer Support Group, made up of survivors of prostate cancer and men who are still fighting the disease. There will be doctors and there will be friends and family members of those who have not survived their cancer. Events like this will be occurring right around the country. All these people are coming together not only to raise important funds for prostate cancer research but also to support one another. Those who have experience of cancer themselves or a loved one's diagnosis—and that's most of us—know that it is not easy and it is not a fight that you can do or should do alone. Support groups like the one to be celebrated in my barbecue are really important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the barbecue is also to raise awareness. As I said, one in seven men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer. All men need to know the symptoms of this cancer and the risk factors to be aware of, because there is a real chance that the knowledge could one day save their life. The risk factors are simple: your age and family history. Prostate cancer is an age-dependent disease, meaning that as you get older the chance of developing it increases. If a close family member has it, you are also more likely to develop prostate cancer, particularly if your family member was diagnosed while young. If you have a family history, it is recommended that men aged over 40 have a chat to their doctor. For those without a family history, the recommended age to talk to your doctor is 50.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The symptoms of prostate cancer are fairly easy to identify. In the early stages, unfortunately, there maybe no symptoms, but in the later stages some symptoms can include feeling the frequent or sudden need to urinate, finding it difficult to urinate, discomfort when urinating, pain in the lower back, upper thighs or hips, or finding blood in urine or semen. These symptoms may not mean you have prostate cancer, but if you experience any of them, please go to your doctor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The good news is that prostate cancer is survivable. The five-year survival rate is 95 per cent. As always though, the earlier that it is found the better. That's why I and so many across the country are hosting a barbecue this week to show our support. I encourage everybody to get involved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time I have left I also want to briefly make a couple of comments about the sad passing of Danny Frawley this week. Danny is a St Paddie's boy. He is Ballarat through and through. Bungaree spud-farming country is where Danny was born. He has made an amazing contribution, not only to football life—to St Kilda, to Richmond, my own club, and to the many, many boys that he has coached and mentored across those years—but also off the field. He has lent his voice to causes like the Fiona Elsey Cancer Ride in my community. He has mentored many people suffering from depression and lent his voice to so many important causes. As I said, he is Ballarat through and through. We are desperately sad to have lost him. He is someone who is deeply loved, and I know the Bungaree community, his wife, Anita, his mum and the Frawley family, who are so integral in that community, are desperately sad to have lost him. We say thank you for the life of Danny Frawley, who was a great Australian and a great person from Ballarat.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  When I rose to speak for the first time, in October 2015, I said that I believed in an unwritten contract between the dead, the living and the unborn. We are the product of those who have come before us and we should always seek to steward what we have for the next generation. We are to be stewards of the liberties, institutions, prosperity and values that have shaped us as a country. But back then I neglected to talk about stewarding our environment. Tonight, I want to make a postscript to my maiden speech and affirm that the Australian environment—the land and the waterways and the creatures that inhabit them—are also our responsibility. We're called to steward our natural assets and, where necessary, to protect them from those who would damage or destroy them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight, I rise on behalf of my community in the Peel region to oppose the proposed dredging of the Peel-Harvey Estuary by Tian An Australia as part of the major development on Point Grey, which lies on the undeveloped coast of the Peel-Harvey Estuary. I oppose it primarily because I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways—for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place. We're not antiprogress, but we are rightly cautious about development, as we are the ones most affected by it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed dredge, 2.5 kilometres in length, running east to west, will cut the estuary in half and was opposed by the Shire of Murray because the development application did not detail a dredging plan, a spoil disposal plan or a financial plan to demonstrate that dredge was technically, environmentally or economically sound. This decision was made by the Shire of Murray Council, led by President David Bolt, in June of this year, and I back it. This will be contested next month at the state administrative tribunal. My view is that companies like Tian An Australia, backed by Hong Kong listed shareholder Tian An China Investments Company, have no stake in our local community and should not be able to dredge our waterways without the consent of local people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many environmental and economic questions that are yet to be answered, but, in the time remaining, I want to give voice to some of the local leadership. George Wally, an Indigenous elder, says:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">This is our country, our Boodja, the land. And the waterway is part of our country. So when you make decisions to look at what you have in front of you, make the right decision for all people.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Our position has not changed over the past 5 years in that we strongly oppose the dredging of the access channel and inland marina to house 300 oversize boats.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The significant dredging required, and the residual development will have major deleterious impacts to the fishing industry. The proposed channel will be in the middle of the most prolific breeding ground for crabs in the estuary.</span>

When I see things that are still the same as I've seen when I was a kid and they're still the same now, what a fantastic place. And my grandkids see that the same as I saw it.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AN3" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gorton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  I rise to mourn the passing of St Kilda legend and AFL champion Danny Frawley. As a St Kilda fan, a long-suffering St Kilda fan, but one that's still loyal to my team, Danny Frawley was a great player to me and I think to many, many thousands of St Kilda supporters and supporters of Aussie Rules footy. He played for St Kilda between 1984 and 1995 and managed to play 240 games. He was the longest serving captain of St Kilda, between 1987 and 1995. He represented Victoria between 1987 and 1994. He played with some of the great players for St Kilda, including Lockett, Robert Harvey, Stewart Loewe and Nicky Winmar—all great players—but, even amidst those great players, he managed to win St Kilda's best and fairest in 1988. He was an All Australian in the same year, and inducted into the St Kilda Football Club Hall of Fame in 2007. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He also had a role at the Richmond Football Club. He coached Richmond between 2000 and 2004, and led them to a preliminary final in 2001. As we know, life as a coach is tough at the best of times. Coaching Richmond during this period was as tough as it gets. He arrived at Punt Road with dark hair and when he left four years later it had turned grey—a bit like what happened to me. He was chief executive of the AFL Coaches Association for six years, between 2008 and 2014. He did media work with SEN radio and Fox Footy as a commentator. He was a genuinely funny guy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He co-hosted <span style="font-style:italic;">Bounce</span>, where he created the 'golden fist' award to recognise the best defender. There is now a petition to have this award presented on Brownlow Medal night. It has been signed by over 60,000 supporters, and I add my voice to that petition, here in this chamber, to call on the AFL to award this trophy at the Brownlow in Frawley's honour. He was quite right. Great defenders are not often recognised and too often miss out. I think it was a very good idea of his and I hope it gets realised more formally. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He spoke openly about his struggles with mental health. He was not embarrassed by it anymore and wanted to use his experience to help others. I'd like to extend my condolences to his wife, Anita, and daughters Chelsea, Keeley and Danielle, and to his many, many friends. Vale, Danny 'Spud' Frawley.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  Bennelong has the highest number of Armenians of any electorate in the country. This diaspora is very active in our community, and it has a lot of concerns about the issues facing their homeland and region. One thing at the forefront of these concerns is the ongoing animosity between them and their neighbour Azerbaijan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seven years ago, on 31 August, Armenian Army Lieutenant Gurgen Margaryan was murdered with an axe by Captain Ramil Sahib Safarov of the Azerbaijan army. A second officer narrowly missed meeting the same fate. The murder was so heinous it sent shock waves around the world. During a NATO Partnership for Peace program in Hungary, Safarov committed the barbaric act of hacking the sleeping Lieutenant Margaryan with an axe 16 times. He was subsequently charged and convicted on 13 April 2006, when a Hungarian court sentenced Safarov to life imprisonment, with 30 years without parole—the sentence for a cold, calculated murderer. But, in Azerbaijan, Safarov was a national hero. There, President Aliyev believed that not only was Safarov worthy of freedom; he was a patriot worthy of glory rather than of condemnation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent investigation led by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project revealed that several bank transfers in excess of $7 million were made to a Budapest bank account around the time the Hungarian government extradited Safarov to Azerbaijan. This was part of nearly $3 billion in a slush fund tied to Azerbaijan's ruling elite and used to buy influence around the world as revealed by Hungarian investigative journalism NGO Atlatszo. They noted that this Budapest bank account belonged to an offshore company owned by the son of an influential Azerbaijani politician. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Consequently, Safarov was released to Azerbaijan on August 31 after serving only eight years of his sentence. Upon arrival home, he was granted an official pardon by President Aliyev and was gifted a full military parade with a promotion to major as well as a new apartment and eight years of back pay. This is an example of what has become known as 'Armeniaphobia' in Azerbaijan—government-sanctioned racism against Armenians that fosters the kind of hate that leads to axe murders of sleeping innocent soldiers during NATO peace missions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must join the nations of the world in condemning a pardon, a murderer and a president by remembering this act and reminding Azerbaijan that it will not be forgotten now or ever. It is only by recognising the Republic of Artsakh that the people of Artsakh will earn their human rights to self-determination, the right to live in peace and security on their— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  On New Year's Day this year, after a night out with friends in Katoomba, 21-year-old Lachlan Foote headed home to Blackheath, gave his mum a great big hug and wished her a Happy New Year. He then mixed a teaspoon of caffeine powder into a protein shake. Without proper instructions, he didn't know that one teaspoon can be the equivalent of 25 to 50 cups of coffee. He didn't know that it would kill him. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A day shy of his 22nd birthday, Lachlan suffered caffeine toxicity and his parents, Nigel and Dawn, have been fighting ever since that day to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else's child. With the proper rules and regulations, we can make sure that it doesn't. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Caffeine powder is extremely concentrated. It can easily trigger an overdose or a heart attack. In the United States last year, another young man lost his life after unknowingly consuming a fatal dose, and that country has banned concentrated caffeine powder since. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nigel Foote worries that, without the same response here, caffeine powder will continue to be bought and sold without consumers really understanding its dangers. He says Lachlan's caffeine powder was shared between friends and it was very likely that Lachlan never got to read the warning label. He worries that another of Lachlan's friends might have some sitting in a cupboard somewhere. That's why the Footes are fighting to bring awareness to the dangers of caffeine powder. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lachlan's teachers described him as thoughtful, ethical and honest. He was a talented musician and he'd worked hard at Scenic World for the previous five years and had saved up to either study science at university or travel. He was much loved, and the Footes don't want anyone else to lose their son. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've bought this issue to the attention of Minister Hunt in the hope of speedy legislative action. After writing to the minister, I've been advised that Food Standards Australia New Zealand and the Therapeutic Goods Administration are working together to review the regulation of caffeine powder. I can only hope that an outcome is fast for the Footes and that all Australians can be spared the sort of risk that their son faced and the tragic consequences. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The word 'unprecedented' keeps being used in the context of bushfires burning in northern New South Wales and Queensland. These fires, some of them in rainforests, are shocking. But what's not unprecedented is the support that's been given by Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury rural fire volunteers. Many have travelled north. Some 22 went from the Blue Mountains yesterday and 24 are coming back today. They've been assisting in the Drake fire and fires around Armidale, and that's just a contingent from the Blue Mountains. From the Hawkesbury, we've had seven go to Queensland, now on their way back, and five to Tenterfield and Armidale. It's great work they're doing. They're assisted by the large air tanker flying from RAAF Base Richmond. We applaud their efforts.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  In my professional life as a medical researcher and paediatrician I have witnessed firsthand the dramatic increase in food allergies. My research team found that Australia has one of the world's highest incidences of food allergies, with one in 10 infants and one in 20 children affected. Living with food allergies has been likened to living on a tightrope, living life in a perpetual state of hypervigilance because the next meal may result in serious and life-threatening anaphylaxis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A new form of treatment, oral immunotherapy, is offering those with food allergies real hope of a cure. Oral immunotherapy involves planned and managed incremental exposure to the allergen under controlled clinical conditions. The treatment takes many months. In many cases it enables a child with a food allergy to live and eat more safely, and helps families get off the allergy tightrope.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two types of oral immunotherapy: one that involves pharmaceutical products and one that simply involves careful clinical supervision of introducing the food itself. The latter type, food immunotherapy, is being trialled overseas but is not yet available in Australia. Hundreds of Australian families have been travelling overseas in order to access food immunotherapy, to receive the treatment and the potential cure. These families relocate overseas for many months to undertake the painstakingly slow and clinically supervised increase in exposure to allergenic foods so that their son or daughter can become desensitised to that food. The travel, the overseas treatment and the relocation are all paid for by the families themselves. These families are so desperate to make their child's life safer that they are willing to pay literally hundreds of dollars, if not tens of thousands of dollars, from their own pockets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Trials of food immunotherapy require government support in Australia because they involve giving a food, not a drug, and, therefore, pharmaceutical companies cannot profit from the development of this type of immunotherapy. I acknowledge the work of Melissa Mooney, other patients and parents who have children suffering from severe allergies and note that they have already taken proactive measures in putting before the Petitions Committee a petition encouraging the government to invest in food immunotherapy trials. By conducting head-to-head clinical trials of dosing protocols already used overseas we can provide the opportunity of a readily-available treatment right here in Australia. Investment in Australia in trials of food immunotherapy in a practical, accessible form would remove the need for overseas relocation and the expense to patients. Such trials will lessen the burden of food allergy in Australia, and in a cost-effective manner it will save lives.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  Enough is enough. It's time for Alan Jones to hang up his headphones and get off our airwaves. A man who will use his public platform to spread violent, misogynistic and racist views has absolutely no place in our public discourse any longer. Here is just a small sample of the ways Alan Jones has demonstrated in recent years that he does not deserve the privileged position he holds. He has used the N-word on radio more than once. He suggested Julia Gillard's father died of shame. He breached commercial radio standards for his reporting of environmental issues. He bullied the head of the Sydney Opera House live on air and called for her to be sacked because she was unwilling to promote a horse race. He asked Prime Minister Scott Morrison to shove a sock down the throat of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and 'backhand her' after disagreeing with her stance on the need for climate action. This has to end. Alan Jones has to go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After each of these public misdeeds and public outcries he has made a half-baked apology. But an apology is not enough. We need to remove the toxic impact of shock jocks on politics once and for all and we need to start with getting him off air. People may say his program doesn't broadcast into Melbourne, but we hear about everything he says all the time because everything he says gets picked up and repeated by other media outlets all the time. He seems to dictate what the federal government does. We need to grapple with what it means when we continue to allow a man to hold the power he does and use his platform in such a way. It's not just about his listeners; it's about his undue influence over our political system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we also need to consider what it means for our community. What does it mean for a young person when they hear someone on radio threatening violence against a woman? What do they take away from repeated instances of racist statements being met with little punishment? We're lucky to have the position we have here in parliament. Membership of this place gives us a major megaphone to broadcast the messages that matter most to us and our community, and, over decades, Alan Jones has built a megaphone of his own, but his track record of using that megaphone to spread hate, fear and violence must come to an end. We can have different points of view about politics in this country, including on the airwaves, without spreading hate, fear and violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since last year, over 18,000 people have signed my petition calling on 2GB to say to Alan Jones that enough is enough. Disappointingly, as long as he continues to offend, the signatures will continue to flood in. I want to celebrate today the excellent campaign that's being done by so many to chip away at his power. I want to especially celebrate Mad F-ing Witches and Sleeping Giants, both of whom have targeted so effectively the root cause of why Alan Jones can continue to cling to power: advertising revenue. Since his comments about Jacinda Ardern, more than 105 companies have distanced themselves from the program, including Coles, Koala mattresses and Mercedes Benz. This boycott is understood to have already cost the network over $1 million, and this will continue. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:16</span>):  Today I want to highlight the work of two local councils in my electorate of Menzies—namely, Nillumbik and Manningham—that work towards preventing domestic violence, promoting gender equality and helping our children who are struggling with a range of issues affecting their long-term health and wellbeing. First, Nillumbik Shire Council is offering grants of up to $500 to community groups as part of its 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence campaign. These grants are to support awareness-raising community led projects that will be undertaken from 25 November to 10 December this year. For anybody interested in making an application for one of these grants, they close on Friday 20 September. People can visit the website nillumbik.vic.gov.au for further information.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Manningham, the mayoral ball will be held this year on Friday 25 October and all proceeds will go towards supporting the welfare organisation Doncare, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary serving the Manningham community. Funds raised will expand Doncare's service provision in response to the increasing demand for private support for vulnerable children. One of the programs, the Resilient Kids—Positive Futures program, provides a holistic response to children struggling with anxiety and depression; trauma caused by bullying, social issues, family breakdown or family violence; social exclusion due to disadvantage; self-esteem and self-confidence issues; and academic pressures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the children's counselling program, family violence services and information and emergency relief services, Doncare comes into contact with a large number of children presenting with complex issues. For example, 75 per cent of children attending counselling have experienced violence, 11 per cent of children aged 12 to 17 have self-harmed, 17 per cent of students in Manningham have been bullied at school, and 41 per cent of parents with children aged four to 11 did not seek help for their children because they could not afford it. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a relatively well-off area of Melbourne, and these are concerning and indeed alarming statistics in relation to what's happening with many young people in the area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Doncare's priority is to provide support and education to prevent the additional stress on families which increases adolescents' vulnerability. Once again I urge anybody listening to this broadcast or reading <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> who wants to support the wonderful work that Doncare does in Manningham to buy a ticket to the mayoral ball. That can be done by visiting manningham.vic.gov.au.</span>

                  <a href="249127" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONROY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:19</span>):  My office is regularly contacted by constituents about the appalling aged-care and home care crisis that is unfolding in Australia. This is particularly important in my electorate of Shortland, where one in five people are over the age of 65. For these reasons, I wrote to the royal commission that is inquiring into aged-care quality and safety in Australia, inviting them to hold a hearing of the royal commission in my region. A hearing in Newcastle, the Hunter Valley or Lake Macquarie would also be easily accessible for people in Port Stephens, the Central Coast and the Mid North Coast, all of which have large aged populations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the stories we are hearing from the royal commission are truly shocking, and it is equally shocking to realise that there are some 129,000 older Australians on a waiting list for care at home. One of those is my constituent Wally, whom I have spoken about in the House before. It is now 12 months since Wally was approved for a level 4 package, and yet he is still waiting, receiving care at the lower level 2. His devoted wife, Edna, is grateful for help with showering and respite to do the shopping, but she is still not able to go to church, which she misses greatly. Wally and Edna desperately want to remain in their home; they just need the appropriate level of care to enable them to do so. And still they wait.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another constituent, Colin of Speers Point, raised with me the red tape he faced with the application process. Colin was deemed to be eligible for a level 3 package but ran into trouble getting information from Centrelink that he had to provide to the Department of Health. Colin had told My Aged Care that Centrelink had made a mistake and he needed more time to provide the required documents, but he was told an extension was not possible. His package expired and he had to start all over again. This bureaucracy is unacceptable. It just makes it much harder for our senior Australians to get the level of care that they need and are entitled to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another constituent, John, raised with me the fact that packages are assigned to individuals and not to couples and that this can have serious ramifications when one partner goes to hospital, into aged care or passes away. John's mother-in-law, who lives in Redhead, lost her husband in December. He had been receiving a level 4 home care package, but, on his death, Joan was left with no care at all and had to begin the process of applying for care for herself all over again. If a package were assigned to a couple and one of them passes, moves into residential care or even goes into hospital, the remaining partner could be re-assessed to determine their needs and the appropriate adjustments could be made to the package, even as an interim measure. Instead, Joan was left without any care at all. Joan was fortunate in that she had family to step in, but that is not the case for everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government must hear these concerns and must respond. It must increase the number of home care packages to meet the demand, and it must hear the voices giving evidence to the royal commission. Our aged-care system is not working and the government must act.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:22</span>):  I rise today to congratulate a wonderful couple in my electorate of Bass who recently celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary. Faye and Vince Davis were married on 29 August 1959 in the St John of God Catholic Church in Auburn, New South Wales. Vince was a gunner in the Royal Australian Artillery and Faye a clerk typist. They married sooner than expected when the Army decided to transfer Vince to Perth as a gunnery instructor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On return to Sydney, they started a family: Gary born in 1961 and Lisa born in 1963. Vince left the Army and joined the New South Wales Metropolitan Fire Brigade. Money was tight, but the great Australian dream finally came to fruition for Faye and Vince when they purchased a home in the Western Sydney suburb of St Marys.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vince moved to the then Department of Civil Aviation as an airport crash rescue firefighter. In 1971, Faye and Vince moved their family to Brisbane so that Vince could take up a position at Brisbane Airport. Career highlights included promotion to airport fire officer and on several occasions being appointed the nominated rescue officer should Her Majesty the Queen's flight run into trouble. For his services to Australia, Vince has several awards, including the National Medal and the Australian Defence Medal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shortly after moving to Brisbane, Faye studied and trained to become a maternity nurse at the Royal Women's Hospital, enjoying a 25-year career caring for the new mothers and babies of Brisbane. On his retirement, Vince was offered a week's work grounds-keeping at Brisbane's Doomben Racecourse, but it was another five years later before he hung up the overalls. Not being people to sit still for too long, Faye and Vince indulged their love of all things Gaelic and joined the Wynnum RSL Pipe Band, where Vince played drums and Faye managed the band.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following a health scare for Faye eight years ago, the couple relocated to the cooler climate of Tasmania where they call George Town home and continue to serve their community—Faye on the Ainslie House auxiliary committee, where she served many years as president, raising funds to enhance the lives of the elderly residents, and Vince serves the George Town RSL Sub Branch as president. Vince and his colleagues work tirelessly to benefit returned and former ADF members. This includes many hours in front of the barbecue at Bunnings to raise funds. Thanks to the Tasmanian Liberal government, the RSL now has a new home incorporating a memorabilia display after losing their former premises in 2016.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In August this year Vince was diagnosed with an extremely rare form of carcinoma, and he is currently undergoing radiation therapy in the Launceston General Hospital. Thanks to early detection, his prognosis is good. Everything they have done has been together. Today Faye and Vince have four grandchildren and one great-grandchild, with another due in January. Congratulations, Faye and Vince.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COLLINS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:25</span>):  I stand here today on behalf of constituents of mine in the Huon Valley. The Huon Valley, of course, was affected very badly by bushfires earlier this year, but they've also been fighting another fight, and that's to save their Centrelink services. Sadly, since the Liberal federal government came to office, more than 500 federal public servants have been ripped out of Tasmania, and the Huon Valley Centrelink office is the next target. The Huon Valley Centrelink office, we understand, is going to be co-located with a Service Tasmania office. We know that, when this happened at Kingston, services and privacy became a really serious issue, and everybody that I have spoken to in the Kingston community says the service that they're getting from the co-located office is not the same as it was when it was a full, proper Centrelink office. So the residents of the Huon Valley are rightly quite concerned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a bit of an issue last year, or earlier this year, when they reduced the number of staff at that Centrelink office from three to two. It got to the ludicrous situation where, because of security concerns—because staff are often there on their own—they had to hire a security guard, and so they had to get back a third staff member via a security firm. Then they realised how ludicrous this was and they put back another staff member, or relocated another staff member down there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have a really serious problem with the Huon Valley Centrelink office. Over the many years that they've been in office, they've been slowly degrading the services of the Huon Valley Centrelink office. They've been slowly reducing the number of staff and are trying to reduce it even further. Locals are fed up. They're tired. They had to go through the bushfires earlier this year. They need Centrelink services in Huonville. There's no public transport in and out of Huonville. It's a small town about 45 minutes south of Hobart. There is no way for locals to access Centrelink services other than to drive themselves into Hobart. It is not good enough for this government to go round pretending it's the friend of those living in regional Australia and then to cut and remove their services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the local Liberal senators, Senator Eric Abetz, has been involved in this and has been spoken to. Senator Abetz said, 'It's our job to prudently review the number of public servants.' They've cut over 500 federal public servants from Tasmania since they came to office! I and my constituents say, 'Enough is enough.' This cannot go on. The residents in the Huon Valley want to maintain their Centrelink services in a standalone Centrelink office that's properly staffed and can deal with local concerns and local constituents. It needs to have local staff who know and understand the local community. It is not good enough to have drive-in drive-out people coming from Hobart on a regular basis to serve the local community. I seek leave to table a petition about the services. It is not an approved petition.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282981" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:28</span>):  I'm proud to say that the Gold Coast is making leaps and bounds in the health and knowledge space. Our health and knowledge precinct currently employs around 10,000 people, expected to grow to over 26,000 people in the coming years. It's supported by world-class infrastructure, spanning more than 200 hectares, and is globally unique. It incorporates Griffith University, my alma mater; Gold Coast University Hospital; the new Gold Coast Private Hospital; and Cohort and is a space which is harnessing the talents of our health and knowledge professionals, academics and local business to build a collaborative entrepreneurial community. As part of National Science Week, I recently had the pleasure of speaking at the Cohort opening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With strengths in glycomics, advanced design and manufacturing and allied health and medicine, the precinct has the potential to play a major role in attracting international investment to Queensland and my electorate of Moncrieff. Research has found that co-working spaces are vital to thriving innovation precincts. That's because these spaces foster innovation and the sharing of ideas. I'd like to congratulate the general manager, Ariana Margetts, who has been instrumental in bringing this space to life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cohort is situated on von Itzstein Street, named after Professor Mark von Itzstein, whom I've had the pleasure of meeting a couple of times now. He's making much progress, at the Griffith Institute for Glycomics, in bringing vaccines into clinical trials, with the ultimate goal of delivering them to market. I'd like to congratulate the professor for his incredible contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks ago, I visited the institute, with Health Minister Greg Hunt, to see the research they are doing—sponsored by Broadbeach Rotary Club—on the malaria vaccine. They are also undertaking cutting-edge research into individual treatment for ovarian cancer. The nearby ADaPT 1 Institute, which specialises in 3D printing, assists surgeons when performing high-risk surgeries on brain aneurysms and cerebral palsy patients. Congratulations to Dr Hal Rice and Dr Laetitia de Villiers for the groundbreaking work they are doing to save lives through new surgical techniques using the latest technologies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This again champions our local industry for not only preventing life-threatening diseases here and abroad, but also boosting our local economy and creating jobs. A few kilometres away from the health and knowledge precinct is a company making progress in the tech medical industry. The health minister and I launched THC Global in Southport, the largest medicinal cannabis manufacturing facility in the country. They are producing medical cannabis at a far lower cost, compared to other global markets. For Australian patients, this means there is easier access to high-quality products at a more affordable prices. It also benefits our local economy, creating 75 jobs in Moncrieff alone, plus an extra 150 jobs in Bundaberg and in Ballina, through its export opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Science and innovation, health and knowledge are vital to our society. They give us the skills to think creatively, to innovate, to collaborate and to make informed decisions that can affect lives around the globe. The Gold Coast Health and Knowledge Precinct, which is in my electorate, is driving great discoveries that help to solve some of our biggest challenges.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  I'm pleased to support these appropriation bills, which make provision for the moneys required to be appropriated from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, as part of the 2019-20 federal budget, to fund the day-to-day operations of the Commonwealth. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2019-20 provides for an appropriation of $58.4 billion to fund the ordinary annual services of the government, which includes the departmental costs of Australian government agencies, and funding within administered outcomes, which have been previously endorsed by the parliament. In particular, there are a number of key appropriations worthy of note. The Department of Defence has been allocated $19.7 billion to enhance the military capabilities of our nation, to protect and advance Australia's strategic national interests and to promote regional security and stability. Included is funding to support ongoing Defence operations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is located in the dynamic geopolitical region, which is home to a number of emerging nations that are investing heavily to expand their military capabilities. It has been a key priority to increase Australia's defence spending to two per cent of gross domestic product. In order to maintain and enhance the effectiveness of the Australian Defence Force, we must invest in facilities, infrastructure, equipment, weapons, technology and personnel to protect and defend our nation and its national interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is reassuring to see continued investment in our domestic defence industry, which ensures that local expertise is maintained. In Western Australia, major infrastructure projects and upgrades are being completed at Army, Navy and Air Force bases located at Campbell Barracks, HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Stirling</span> and RAAF Pearce. Our local defence industry, located primarily at the Australian Marine Complex at Henderson, employs many Western Australians in shipbuilding and allied industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Health will receive $6.3 billion to strengthen health services for all Australians and to support better mental health services. Resources have been allocated to alcohol and drug support services and towards improving access to aged residential care and home care services, increasing access to medicines and implementing the Sport 2030—National Sport Plan. In my electorate the federal government has already delivered $158 million in funding towards a proposed $360 million extension of Joondalup hospital. Expanding the Joondalup hospital will reduce emergency department waiting times and alleviate the need for local patients to travel long distances to Perth for medical treatment. However, the WA Labor government has reneged on its 2017 election commitment to contribute 50 per cent of the funding required to extend the hospital. To date, no provision has been made in the McGowan government's budget for its half-share of the Joondalup hospital expansion. This is an unfulfilled election commitment which is forcing many residents to drive long distances to Perth for medical treatment—in most cases, a two-hour round trip for each medical appointment. We must put pressure on the WA Labor government to commence construction of the promised extension to Joondalup hospital.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the coalition government's priority to provide a greater range of medical services in Joondalup. As our population ages, there is a need to provide more aged- and respite-care facilities to meet a growing need among my constituents. It is encouraging to see additional aged-care facilities planned for Iluka, Currambine, Edgewater and Joondalup. The federal government is ensuring that an adequate number of places are funded each year for our elderly residents. The appropriation bill allocates $5.6 billion to the Department of Social Services, including funding for the Commonwealth contribution to prevent domestic violence against women and children; the expansion of the cashless debit card, to tackle drug, alcohol and gambling abuse; and the establishment of a royal commission into violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation of people with a disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Disability Insurance Scheme is being implemented across my electorate, with a service provider based in Joondalup. It is essential that witnesses receive the care and support packages they need to meet their daily living requirements. Community consultation has been conducted to receive feedback from participants about how the rollout can be improved. The federal government is providing the necessary resources to ensure that the delivery of services is orderly and meets community expectations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Moore electorate there are many non-government organisations working tirelessly to provide social services to people in need, including the Spiers Centre, the Salvation Army and many church based organisations delivering relief services. These charitable organisations are staffed by dedicated volunteers and conduct their own fundraising activities with support from the local community. The federal government provides financial assistance to these worthy organisations through programs such as Stronger Communities and Volunteer Grants, which continue to be funded in the current budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The provision of $3.2 billion has been made to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to advance Australia's international strategic security and economic interests and to manage and distribute Australia's official development assistance. In particular, our diplomatic engagement with emerging nations in South-East Asia and the Indo-Pacific region will promote increased regional trade and economic development in a region which is experiencing strong economic growth. Economic security will in turn promote stability, good governance and national security through cooperation with neighbouring nations. Similarly, $2.5 billion has been provided to the Department of Home Affairs to fund additional national security measures, including the management of noncitizens within onshore and offshore detention; to better resource the Australian Border Force to facilitate the legal movement of people and goods across the border; and to provide refugee and humanitarian assistance. Australia's aid program is generous, orderly and equitable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Treasury received $3 billion to implement recommendations of the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry, the resourcing of the corporate tax avoidance task force and the expansion of single touch payroll. These measures are designed to assist small business. It is important to ensure that finance brokers and financial planners—many of whom are small business operators—are not adversely impacted by overzealous regulation. Comprehensive and adequate consultation with the financial services industry prior to implementing reforms to protect consumers is essential. I recently held a forum in my electorate where local finance brokers could raise their concerns. Australia has a strong financial services sector with good governance fundamentals, so government should exercise caution when regulating the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving on to Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2019-20, an appropriation of $7.4 billion is provided to fund the non-ordinary annual services of government, including capital works and services, payments to the states, territories and local government authorities, and funding for new administrative outcomes not previously endorsed by parliament. In my electorate, the City of Joondalup receives financial assistance grants from the federal government for the purpose of road construction and also in the form of general purpose financial grants. Last year, the City of Joondalup received $2.9 million in federal financial assistance grants, which has helped to subsidise the amenities provided to ratepayers. Appropriations include $2.3 billion to the Department of Defence to enable the purchase of military equipment and the construction of support facilities and infrastructure in line with the commitment to implement the strategic capabilities outlined in the 2016 defence white paper. As I mentioned earlier, my Perth based electorate is located in close proximity to RAAF Base Pearce, the HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Stirling</span> naval base and Campbell Barracks, all of which are being refurbished and upgraded to modernise the facilities and bolster our security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the rollout of the National Broadband Network is progressing well across Australia, there are some older established suburbs in my electorate which are yet to receive satisfactory service. My office has assisted individual cases. To improve broadband digital connectivity, $1.7 billion has been allocated to the Department of Communications and the Arts to provide NBN Co with a government loan on commercial terms to support the completion of the National Broadband Network across Australia. A number of constituents in the established suburbs in my electorate have contacted my office to express concerns about access to the NBN. These concerns have been conveyed to our NBN parliamentary liaison channels, and this additional funding will provide NBN Co with the necessary resources to address the connectivity issues in a more timely manner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development has been allocated $1.3 billion to fund airports and inland rail projects, concessional loan funding for the National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility and payments to the states for the Roads to Recovery Program. Local government authorities across Australia rely on the Roads to Recovery Program to complete important road safety projects, including many arterial roads in the cities of Joondalup and Wanneroo. The horticultural industry in the city of Wanneroo is facing a shortage of water allocations for fruit and vegetable growers and would benefit from this federal investment in water infrastructure. Our local horticultural growers would benefit from access to recycled water from local waste water treatment plants located at Beenyup and Alkimos being diverted for use on crops or to recharge the groundwater aquifers which are being depleted for household use. The bill provides $295 million to the Department of Agriculture for concessional loans to farm businesses, including loans to those affected by drought or flood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the north of my electorate, the extension of the northern suburbs railway from Butler to Yanchep will provide a continuous rail connection between Yanchep and the Perth CBD via Joondalup. This key investment and public transport infrastructure will bring commuters into central Joondalup from Perth to the south, and the growing residential corridor to the north, giving local businesses a much needed economic boost. There is scope to transform Yanchep into a major strategic regional hub through the smart cities program, taking advantage of upgraded road access provided by the NorthLink WA project, to form a gateway to the productive agricultural regions via Muchea, with the potential for a regional airport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third bill, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2019-2020, provides for the services of the parliamentary departments with funding of $161 million for a range of initiatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In concluding, I commend these appropriation bills which make provision for the moneys required to be appropriated from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. As part of the federal budget to fund the day-to-day operations of the Commonwealth, this legislation enables the provision of improved services, facilities and amenities for the benefit of my constituents. I commend the bills to the House.</span>

                    <a href="ECV" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:46</span>):  In making a contribution on the appropriation legislation before the House, I want to raise the issue of homelessness. Some of the most distressing and desperate circumstances that come across my desk—or visit my office, quite frankly—relate to constituents who are at risk of homelessness, and I am sure that's common for many of us. According to the 2016 census, homelessness in Australia has increased by 13.7 per cent over the last five years. That's approximately 116,000 Australians who are experiencing homelessness on any given night. What a tragedy in a country like Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While homelessness and housing instability is a very real problem across the nation, it is particularly dire in electorates like mine, where there's an overrepresentation of disadvantaged and vulnerable individuals and those trying to support their families in those circumstances. Issues such as mental health, disability, unemployment, relationship breakdown, substance abuse, gambling addiction, and family and domestic violence can all put people at risk of homelessness. Sadly, I see this occurring disproportionally in my electorate. The constituents that come to my office are often dealing with very complex and multifaceted issues. These vulnerable individuals frequently end up stuck in a very vicious cycle. Housing instability and homelessness often increase vulnerability to adverse social and economic circumstances. These individuals and their families face a greater risk of poor outcomes in education, employment and health, as well as an increased risk of being involved with the justice system of our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Women and children are at greater risk of homelessness as a result of domestic and family violence. Violence against women is one of the most serious and distressing issues facing our community. Women on temporary visas who are escaping violence have no access to welfare and no work rights; they face language barriers and are restricted from seeking appropriate help. Often they are socially isolated, may not have the support of family and friends in Australia and certainly are not able to afford social housing. There are many such people in my electorate—immigrants and refugees—and, until they are given permanent citizenship, this can be a very significant issue for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently Mission Australia released a report that identified domestic and family violence as one of the main reasons women and children are becoming homeless in Australia. In light of the astounding statistic, the CEO of Mission Australia, James Toomey, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We need to do more to prevent, reduce and ultimately eliminate domestic and family violence if we are to have any chance of ending homelessness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a pretty powerful quote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Local service providers in my community certainly agree with his view on this. For instance, the CEO of Bonnie Support Services, Tracy Phillips, said, 'The biggest challenge faced by support and safe accommodation services for women is the severe shortage of affordable and social housing.' Local service providers are struggling to keep up with the demand for crisis accommodation and transitional housing as women in greater numbers are now sleeping rough, and that figure continues to rise—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HAYES:</span>
                    </a>  Further, there are systemic barriers impacting on women existing on Newstart or low incomes, particularly those who don't have a rental history, and, as I've already mentioned, on women who are on temporary visas without social security payments or social support. What is clear is that it is women who are at the most immediate risk of homelessness in our society. With the lack of long-term social and affordable housing, women, particularly those experiencing domestic violence, will continue to be pushed into homelessness. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A further point on the issue of systemic barriers is the government's position on the rather dismal rate of Newstart. I think every member here has to ask themselves, 'How does anyone live on $40 a day, covering the cost of food and transport, particularly given the rising costs of housing?' The simple answer is that they don't. The government has been pressured from all quarters of the community to lift the Newstart rate, yet the Prime Minister is determined that that will not occur under his government. A recent survey conducted by the Australian Council of Social Service found that more than half the people on Newstart who participated in the study have less than $100 left each week after paying their housing costs. That's $100 each week to live on. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The chronic shortage of social housing and affordable homes and the increased levels of housing stress also place people on Newstart at an extremely high risk of becoming homeless. Many individuals have to rely on the support of families and friends to simply have a roof over their heads. Without the support of refuge services, including those offered by charities, such as the Women's Housing Company or St Vincent de Paul Society, many of these people wouldn't even have that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Karen Devins, the specialist homelessness services manager at St Vincent de Paul, voiced her concerns about having to turn people away from the men's shelter out in my electorate of Liverpool, which joins the member for Werriwa's electorate. For a wealthy country like ours, this should not be happening. For many low-income households in my community, the lack of social rental housing has placed an enormous strain on families who are forced to pay unacceptably high housing costs. This puts these people at risk of homelessness. It is a very real threat for them and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An inadequate supply of affordable rental housing, in particular, has led to an increasing number of households paying more than a third of their income on rent. It is no wonder that my electorate of Fowler, regrettably, topped the nation in terms of rental stress, according to the research done by the University of New South Wales. They found that 44 per cent of households in Fowler are living with rental stress. With the average household income in my electorate just being a little over $60,000, it's little wonder that the great Australian dream of owning a home for most is going to remain just that—a dream. As low- and middle-income households are excluded from home ownership, this will continue to put pressures on the private rental market. Consequently, rent will become increasingly unaffordable for many living from pay check to pay check.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With more families struggling to afford the private rental market, the demand for affordable or social rental housing is clearly outstripping supply. I therefore find it troubling that the newly appointed Assistant Minister for Community Housing, Homelessness and Community—that was his title—in an ABC interview tried to put a positive spin on our growing housing and homelessness crisis. It is at a crisis level. I don't see how we can say anything positive where there are more Australians sleeping rough on the streets and in their cars or forced to stay with friends and family due to a lack of social housing. In 2016, the Census showed that the rate of homelessness is almost five per cent higher than the rate of population growth in this country. There is no denying the fact that homelessness, perpetuated by our severe housing problem, is a critical issue and is one that we, as community representatives, have a responsibility to address.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">National Homelessness Week took place when the parliament was sitting last month. It was to raise awareness and highlight the issues faced by people experiencing homelessness and those at risk. In our electorates—I'm referring to the member for Werriwa and myself—the Whitlam Library in Cabramatta established the homelessness hub to provide homeless people and those at risk a safe space where they could access support services, morning tea and some collegiality. In addition to that, for those who are sleeping rough particularly in the winter the Liverpool Neighbourhood Connections, supported by the Liverpool City Council, purchased 114 backpack beds to protect people sleeping on the streets. That is simply a short-term fix. It's a short-term fix for a very broken system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These initiatives highlight the evident need that we have for concerted action. Every tier of government has a role to play to address homelessness and to reduce its detrimental effects on the lives of people and their families. Everyone deserves to have a roof over their heads. Everyone deserves safety, security, privacy and stability. Everyone deserves to live with dignity and respect. In a developed society like Australia, homelessness should not be on the rise. No amount of positive spin by politicians will be able to mask the reality that we are currently facing in this nation. We are a wealthy nation. It should not be acceptable for any Australian to be sleeping rough. Access to affordable safe, sustainable housing, I would assert, is a basic human right, and there is much more that this government can do to address housing inequity and homelessness, particularly as we have now reached a crisis point.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="72184" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GILLESPIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  It's my great honour and pleasure to be speaking about the appropriations and the budget delivered this year by the returned coalition Nationals and Liberal government. It was a major effort: six years of continued discipline and economic tough decisions to bring our budget into surplus. In this budget we have got a $7.1 billion projected surplus and we're on track to deliver that—as opposed to a $55 billion deficit when we assumed the government benches in 2013. And we have done this at the same time as lowering taxes. That is a great achievement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Around 4.5 million taxpayers will get a low- and middle-income tax offset of $1,080. If there are two of you working in that wage bracket up to $126,000, there's the potential for both of you to be getting that—up to $2,160 in a rebate which you can put aside against your mortgage, across your leasing payments, add to your savings or just household expenses. That lower tax benefit extends to 10 million taxpayers: the middle- and low-income people are the people that needed the most help, and that's why they were the beneficiaries of it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But our budget also delivers a tax plan out to 2024 that will, in a practical sense, get rid of bracket creep until you get up to earning over $200,000. That is a major long-term plan, but we are delivering in spades already up-front now. If you recall, in last year's budget, we delivered $158 billion worth of tax cuts, and this comes on top of that, and this opposition was promising $375 billion worth of extra taxes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of having a balanced budget, with lower taxes, it means our commitments to extra spending in health, education and aged care are all being delivered. I'll just go through some of them that are making a huge difference in the Lyne electorate. School funding in non-government schools and government schools across the Lyne electorate is going up. But, as well as that, we have other funds to help schools—the Schools Community Fund and other initiatives for regional students and education access in the tertiary space. We are expanding regional university hubs and centres, and we have plans to deliver one here in the Lyne electorate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have the environment community fund and the Stronger Communities Program. All these funds giving direct assistance to our local communities are a result of having a balanced budget. We can't have these sorts of grant funds without maintaining our fiscal discipline. But the big winners are much bigger than these community based funds. We have the Building Better Regions Fund, which is delivering benefits around regional Australia, and we will have the capacity to have another round of that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might just add: aged-care funding—for which I've been fighting for increased services and funding since I was elected into parliament for the Lyne electorate in 2013—in the Lyne electorate has gone up from $90 million per year in recurrent funding to over $135 million in recurrent funding. There are huge capital works underway in aged care. In Forster, GLAICA are developing a massive extension. The plans are drawn up and things are about to kick off. They've already done their seniors living complex. In Wauchope, Bundaleer Care Services are in receipt of an $8.6 million capital grant to extend onto a new site and deliver an aged-care facility specialising in dementia. That will be a $30 million project, courtesy of that $8 million grant from the federal aged-care budget. We also have two new aged-care capital works projects that are going to be rolled out, and this budget and the forward estimates are delivering the funds for that. We've got the Figtrees on the Manning project, which is being started by Bushland Health in Taree. Bushland Health runs many seniors living complexes and aged-care facilities, and they are building a new seniors living and aged-care facility 500 metres from their existing facility in downtown Taree. That is courtesy of an $8.6 million grant as well, for all the public works that have to be done to create this new complex. It's really going to transform the Manning Valley and the Taree economy. We also have on the books a $25 million capital works expansion by the Salvation Army, also in Taree, and the builders have commenced building a brand new 58-bed, state-of-the-art aged-care facility in Gloucester in the middle of the Lyne electorate. We also have cranes in Forster, with an $18 million initial build at the Forster Civic Precinct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our budget considerations and management have delivered the funds to make these capital works projects go ahead. It's a massive injection of economic activity when an aged-care facility is built. You have the capital works to start with, which delivers construction employment and fit-out. It delivers services, so there's social benefit. The economic benefit is that all these aged-care facilities require long-term, regular, non-seasonal employment of highly skilled workers. In the Lyne electorate, we have the oldest demographic in the country. This work comes on top of earlier capital works extensions done in the southern part of the electorate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this budget has delivered tax cuts not just for low- and middle-income earners—all 10 million of them who are going to get a benefit—but for small businesses, which are the engine room of the economy in our regional electorates. Small businesses that have turnovers of less than $50 million are now paying 27½ per cent company tax. We have increased the instant asset write-off from $25,000 to $30,000. By 2021-22, at the end of this term of government, we'll be getting to the range where, with the tax plan, the small business company tax rate will be dropping down to 25 per cent. With the changes in this last budget extending the threshold up to a turnover of $50 million, 22,000 more businesses will get the benefit of the instant asset write-off and the 27½ per cent company tax rate. We're also making sure that we are getting tax from multinationals that earn money and earn profits in the country, and that has delivered $12 billion into our Treasury. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other big winner from the Lyne electorate budget is extra roads funding. We've announced $20 million for the Bucketts Way upgrade process, which is a staged process. In my first term of government, we delivered $16.5 million to the Bucketts Way upgrade. This $20 million will go into funds added by the state government and by the local government, the MidCoast Council. And because it links the Pacific Highway with the New England Highway, there's another $5 million from the Roads of Strategic Importance and Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity tranche of the infrastructure budget. So we are getting winners across the board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as having the most senior, experienced and wise demographic in the country we have various areas on the coast experiencing rapid growth in population, with young families moving into the area. Schools are expanding. Funding for both government and non-government schools is going up. There is an absolute commitment from this government to deliver the best for every child in Australia. That also extends to our preschool commitment. We are delivering the funds required for every child in the year before school to have 12 hours of preschool in preparation for the start of their formal education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only that, changes were rolled out before the budget—and this budget is funding them. There is an extra $2.7 billion for child care. It all has to be paid for. That's the amazing thing. We have increased spending on child care, preschool, government schools and non-government schools. We have had increases in funding to the states for the hospital system. We've had increased funding for a number of drugs on the PBS. We've started re-indexing Medicare rates. We've got record funding going into bulk-billing. This is at the same time as bringing the budget into surplus.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of that is good fiscal management. We have also reduced the number of people who are requiring income support. We have delivered 1.4 million new jobs. The majority of that increase has been in recent months towards full-time employment, not part-time employment, which the other side tends to criticise. The senior end of the working life spectrum has also experienced growth. At the young end of the spectrum we have seen the same phenomenon. We have many programs that have delivered people back into the workplace, such as the Youth Jobs PaTH. All these policies have been rolled out. The Prepare-Trial-Hire initiative has been incredibly successful. We have got young people into jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned earlier in my speech on this budget our commitment to regional study hubs. They are going forward. There's another round coming up. All that is being funded by good fiscal management. Everything is possible if you can balance your books. We have grown the pie, we have grown the economy, and we have had massive growth in employment over the last six years. We are committed to continuing that. At the same time we have got the lowest proportion of people requiring income support for decades. We've been able to grow the pie and reduce expenditure on income support. The best support we can give unemployed people is getting the economy freed up so that businesses can employ people, and that's what we have been doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just the other day we announced another program for businesses that are modernising their manufacturing capability. Large businesses will be able to apply in a competitive grants round so that they can co-invest in new manufacturing infrastructure. We do have a manufacturing base. We lost a lot of our bulk, cheaper manufacturing jobs over the last 15 or 20 years, but we have seen a growth in smart manufacturing, niche manufacturing, high-value input manufacturing and bespoke manufacturing. It's just a different sort of manufacturing. We have got companies like that in the Lyne electorate that do export. Food Machines makes equipment for many bodies in the US and other overseas countries as well as around this country. We have sporting goods manufacturers in the Manning Valley that provide high-quality, cutting-edge carbon fibre oars to rowers around the world. At the world championships, at national championships and at the Olympics, if you look on the TV screen, about 70 per cent of those oars will be from Croker Oars Australia, made in the beautiful Lyne electorate. And they have been growing as a result of our earlier program, the Regional Jobs and Investment Program on the north coast. All of these things are amazingly possible because we've controlled our finances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a great honour to be the member for Lyne— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="144732" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PAYNE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  Labor supports Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2019-2020 and the associated bills, as we do not block supply. But I, like many of the Canberrans I represent, am deeply concerned about the future that the Morrison government outlines for Australia in these documents. We are concerned about the way that these bills solidify opportunities for some and forego creating opportunities for all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are concerned about the government's lack of a plan to address the critical issues facing Australia that need urgent attention. Where is the government's plan to address the inadequacy of Newstart allowance for recipients trying to pay the bills and find work on less than $40 a day? Where is the plan to address the $1.6 billion underspend in the NDIS because participants are not actually able to access the supports they need? Where is the plan for our economy in response to the increasing body of evidence that indicates it is stagnating? That stagnation is most evident in the pay packets of working Australians, and the government has no plan to address this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government is now in its third term. It should have a well-established plan to address the serious issues facing our nation. But, instead, in the Prime Minister's own words, this week's objective was to test Labor—to test Labor on the latest rehash of the Liberal's disgraceful policy to drug-test social security recipients, in spite of all the advice of doctors and other experts that this is a harmful and ineffective policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Something that the Morrison government has announced a plan for, though, is the Australian Public Service. That plan is to cut an extra $1.5 billion from it over the next four years. That's what I want to focus on in my speech today. The Australian Public Service is vital to a well-functioning democracy and to delivering services for people all around Australia. We all rely on the APS to deliver services, to keep us safe and to ensure that taxpayers' funds are used as efficiently and effectively as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Public servants are the people struggling to deliver important services at Centrelink and the National Disability Insurance Agency, in spite of being majorly understaffed. They are the people who ensure infant formula is safe, who stop drugs at our borders and who provide early warnings for natural disasters. They are also the people who provide governments with frank and fearless advice, to help them develop the best policies for our nation, and they provide the expertise to ensure that these policies are implemented effectively. Public servants live all around Australia, from Bunbury to Townsville.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Actually, nearly two-thirds of our public servants live outside Canberra. But of course the Public Service has a particularly important place here in my electorate. Housing the Public Service is one of the key reasons our city was established as the capital, and we are proud of the role that our Public Service and our city play in serving the Australian people. In fact, in my electorate 25 per cent of employed people work for the Commonwealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Canberra we are well used to being a punching bag for Liberal governments: job cuts, broken promises and the slashing of resources across the Australian Public Service have been trademarks of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government. In Melbourne, two days prior to the election, the Treasurer and the finance minister revealed what many of my constituents had feared, that a further $1.5 billion would be cut from the Public Service over the next four years. That's $1.5 billion from a Public Service already cut to the bone. The Treasurer and the finance minister waited for the election advertising blackout to begin before going hard on the Public Service, safe in the knowledge that this last-minute announcement would be less likely to hurt Senator Zed Seselja, the Liberal Senator for Canberra, who has consistently neglected the jobs, incomes and services that his constituents rely on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unable to do any TV or radio media during the election media blackout, I and my parliamentary colleagues here in Canberra—Senator Katy Gallagher; the member for Bean, David Smith; and the member for Fenner, Andrew Leigh—went hard on social media to tell Canberrans what the Liberals were proposing to do. These cuts will force agencies to scale back important programs like services for veterans, health funding, funding for schools and federal policing, with agencies required to find savings to their budgets of two per cent each year for the next two years, 1.5 per cent in 2021-22 and one per cent in 2023. It builds on this government's appalling record on the Public Service, including 15,000 jobs cut across the service. More than 2,700 jobs have been cut from the Department of Human Services alone, diminishing its ability to deliver services effectively. There have been six years of industrial disputes with their own workforce. There has been a blow-out in spending on external contractors and consultancies. Contracts for temporary personnel services have increased more than fivefold to $1.2 billion. Spending on consultancy contracts has nearly doubled. Nearly $1 billion in taxpayer funds have been awarded to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation and Paladin in questionable processes. And, in an extreme insult to Canberrans, there was the relocation of public agencies to government-held electorates, at significant cost to the taxpayer, and the loss of professional expertise and scientific knowledge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal government should respect the unique role and value of the APS to all Australians. Instead of hollowing it out, the Morrison government should invest in the capability of the APS and its people and ensure that it is focused on delivering for the Australian community. The Morrison government's additional efficiency dividend will affect jobs in Canberra and families who rely on these jobs. The Prime Minister regularly talks about Canberra as a bubble, as if no-one lives here or as if the people of Canberra somehow aren't real and aren't living in real families and real communities. These are real jobs; these are real people. They are people who work extremely hard and take great pride in what they do—as they should, because they are serving our nation, ensuring vital services are delivered and that the safety of our community is upheld.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister knows this, but it suits his purposes to dismiss our community as a savings option. He knows the hours that the people in his and other departments work and the quality of advice they provide to him, whether he takes it on board or not. He and his ministers know the professionalism with which public servants throw themselves into the requests they receive from their ministers to provide rigorous advice in a timely manner. The impact that every member in this place should be concerned about is that hundreds of millions of dollars every year for the next four years will be stripped out of delivering services for Australians—services for the constituents of every member and senator in this parliament. The government's efficiency dividend will affect all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the efficiency dividends weren't bad enough, since the election, the government and the Prime Minister have continued their attacks on the Public Service and the work that they do. In his address to the Public Service last month, the Prime Minister pointed the finger at the APS for being too focused on high-flying corporate lobbyists in the Qantas Chairman's Lounge or the Ottoman. This is a disgraceful misrepresentation—and, as I said, the Prime Minister knows it. Anyone who has worked in the Public Service, as I have, also knows that you're not having lunches or hanging out in airport lounges, let alone in the Qantas Chairman's Lounge. It is not how public servants operate, and, furthermore, they don't have the time or the money for that sort of thing. I remember well the time that my division at the Treasury decided we didn't have the budget to send a single staff member to a one-day conference at Melbourne university that was central to our work. This criticism is appallingly misplaced from a government that prefers to listen to consulting firms and lobbyists over their own workforce. It is hypocritical in the extreme when we see ministers coming under fire from the National Audit Office over the process for which nearly $1 billion was handed to Paladin and the Great Barrier Reef Foundation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his press conference in July, the Prime Minister made some statements about the future of the Public Service that concern me and many of my constituents. The Prime Minister stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the purpose of being here today is to say that when it comes to the public service, that is the engine room through which a government implements its agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He clarified:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… let me explain to you what I mean by implementation. It is the job of the public service to advise you of the challenges that may present to a Government in implementing its agenda. That is the advisory role of the public service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, implementation is a key role of the Public Service, and a task that public servants bring vital expertise and dedication to. But the advisory role of the APS is certainly broader than that. The frank and fearless advice and broader expertise of the Public Service is central to well-informed policy and well-functioning democracy. The Australian Public Service is a source of evidence based advice. It is a source of research and a source of sound, world-leading policy thinking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite persistent undermining of their integrity by this government, the Public Service continues to deliver frank and fearless advice to the Prime Minister and his cabinet—the Public Service that serves government diligently and apolitically, no matter what challenges and cuts are thrown their way. Why do they do it? Because, in my experience, public servants are deeply committed to getting the best outcomes for Australia. Public servants want to deliver vital support to the most vulnerable in our community, like social security and disability supports, in a timely and effective manner. They want to keep Australians safe. They want to see the best outcomes for our environment, our schools, our hospitals and health system. They want to see taxpayers' money used in the most efficient and effective ways. As the member for Canberra, I will continue to defend the work they do and give them the respect they deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the insults felt by my constituents at these comments, they also express fear that there are signals of what is to come—signals that the government wants the Public Service to be even smaller; signals that major changes, like the creation of Services Australia, will be driven by consultants, charging up to $16,000 per day, rather than trusted APS employees working in the public interest; and signals that the government wants to deplete the services it provides. These actions will no doubt impact on the most vulnerable Australians. This is very, very bad news not just for Canberra but for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We deserve better than the Treasurer's efficiency dividends and the Prime Minister's vision for a smaller Public Service. Of course, these cuts flow straight through to Canberra's business community. Creating jobs and growing the economy in a place like Canberra is tough when the Morrison government is doing everything it can to prevent these things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Barr Labor government in the ACT is doing all it can to fill the gaps with visionary projects like light rail, revitalising our public housing stock and pursuing 100 per cent renewable electricity by 2020. But it can't do it all by itself. So what would I say to the government on this? Stop talking about the Labor Party and get on with governing. And, finally, I say to the public servants who live throughout the ACT: along with my ACT Labor colleagues, I will be your advocate in this place for as long as I am here and for the work that you do.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gorton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  Thank you very much. I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2019-2020 and to respond to some of the claims made by the government that somehow the economy is going so well. The fact is we've got some major challenges in this country—some structural challenges, economic headwinds—that the government seems to want to either ignore or wish away. The reality is that, regardless of the rhetoric by the Prime Minister or the Treasurer, we have some very challenging times indeed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that if we were to confine ourselves to the facts, rather than the fiction and mythology of the Morrison government, we might then be able to work our way to a solution. To find your way to a solution you have to accept there's a problem. The government has failed to accept that there are significant problems and failed to acknowledge that they have been derelict in dealing with these matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the seventh year of this government. It's had many iterations. They've been decapitating leaders at a rapid rate, but the fact is that it is the same government with a different leader. It is the seventh year, yet so many of the issues that beset this nation have not been attended to. I can name many: the skills deficiency in the labour market; dealing with reform in, for example, my own portfolio; dealing with research and development investment; tackling the issues that are required; the skills agenda; and making sure that we're responsive to emerging areas of demand in the labour market that are not being attended to. There are so many areas that we have a problem with. Yet you have a Prime Minister and a Treasurer slapping each other's back and doing victory laps while failing the Australian people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to some of those facts. First, Australia is experiencing the slowest economic growth since the global financial crisis. Of course, Labor was in power at the time of that economic shock, the greatest economic shock in 70 years, and we responded more quickly and more appropriately than any other developed nation. That has been affirmed many times over. I was the labour minister at a G20 meeting in Moscow in 2013, where it was the unanimous view of the other 19 representatives around the table that Australia had acquitted itself really well because we moved quickly enough and appropriately enough to deal with the massive contraction of private capital. In doing so, we avoided a recession and we saved hundreds of thousands of jobs and thousands and thousands of businesses. We did that, but right now, without the same excuse that one might have had when dealing with the biggest economic shock since the Great Depression, Australia is experiencing its slowest economic growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, Australia is in its longest per capita recession since the 1982 recession. Mr Deputy Speaker McVeigh, you may recall that that was the recession presided over by Malcolm Fraser—that's how long ago we're talking about—before the election of the Hawke government. We are now in the position of having the longest per capita recession since then, some 37 years ago. Third, Australia became one of the two fastest-growing economies in the OECD under Labor and, indeed, was the eighth-fastest when the government changed hands in 2013. But, under this government, we have dropped to 20th. Think about that. We were one of the two fastest-growing economies during the GFC, but presently we are 20th in the OECD in terms of economic growth. Fourth, living standards have declined under this government, with real household median income lower than it was in 2013. So, since the election of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, we've seen a significant decline and living standards have fallen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fifth, wages have grown at one-eighth the pace of profits other the past year. Now, we're very happy to see profitable companies. That's a good thing; we want to see that. But the failure of this government to attend to the lowest wage growth on record is not only unfair insofar as it affects millions of workers in this country; it is affecting our economy. When you have the lowest wage growth on record, it ultimately leads to falling consumer confidence and falling business confidence, it impacts adversely on aggregate demand and, in effect, you have a consumption problem. Because of that, we have an anaemic economy, and the only thing that seems to be at the disposal of the government or, indeed, the institutions that we have—it is not the government, because the government sits on its hands—is the Reserve Bank, using monetary policy. But increasingly it has less room to move as we continue to cut interest rates. And, of course, the only other institution that's doing anything to mitigate the adverse impacts—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:</span>
                    </a>  As I was saying before we were interrupted by the main chamber, the issue of wages is a critical one, and there's not one policy pronouncement by the government to attend to it. Indeed, if you look at the budget forecasts, you can see every budget forecast by this government since its election in 2013 has been wrong—has been overstated—insofar as wage growth is concerned. Wage growth is a problem, and it's not a recent problem. It's been a problem now for years, and there's been no effort by this government to fix that. As I was saying before we suspended, we have had the Reserve Bank seeking to deal with economic problems using its levers. The only other institution that is seeking to attend to this is the Fair Work Commission. To the credit of the Fair Work Commission, and in particular the president, Ian Ross, there have been three consecutive Fair Work Commission decisions on wages that have actually meant real increases in wages. That only affects about a quarter of the employment in this country, yet it does flow through to other areas. But without the Reserve Bank, who, by the way acknowledge the persistent historically low wage growth, and without the Fair Work Commission introducing real wage increases in three consecutive Fair Work decisions, nothing has been done. Certainly nothing has been done in relation to wages by this do-nothing government, and yet they boast about it. That's what's even more galling. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sixth, productivity has declined every quarter for the last four quarters. So they cannot even claim that they have done anything to arrest the decline in productivity. That's a problem too, because, of course, it is another metric that shows an economy in decline. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Seventh, underemployment is at record highs—1.1 million people in this country are seeking to find more work but are unable to find it. You join that with the unemployment number, we're talking about 1.8 million Australians looking for some work or looking for more work and not being able to find it. I think one of the problems of the government and its economic deficiency is it seems to not understand that the headline unemployment figure is no longer sufficient to show whether the labour market is healthy with respect to unemployment. Because underemployment now is so much a part of the labour market, relying on the idea that the labour market's tightening, because unemployment is at 5.2 per cent is erroneous. It is a foolish and wrong-headed approach. There is so much slack in the labour market, because there are over one million Australians that are looking for more work and are unable to find it, and therefore there is no tightening; there is no tightening, therefore, there is no likelihood of wages going up of their own accord. Yet the government still fails to attend to this problem. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Eighth is that household debt is at a record high of around 190 per cent of disposable income. Ninth is that consumer confidence is down over the year and consumption growth is weak. And I talked about that earlier. When you have low wages growth you have falling consumer confidence, and that affects business confidence. If you look at the trends for consumer and business confidence over the course of the last several years, what you'll see is that, while there might be some peaks and troughs, the underlying long-term trend for consumer confidence is below the long-term average and the long-term trend for business confidence is lower than average. Both metrics underline how anaemic our economy is, and yet the government doesn't recognise it. If you don't recognise the deficiencies or failures in your own economy, then of course it will be harder for the government to prescribe any proper response. Whether it's deliberate, whether it's ignorance or whether it's just incompetence, this government is failing to act on these matters, despite the overwhelming evidence that there are real issues with our economy. The tenth is business investment. As a percentage of GDP, it is at around the lowest levels since the recession of the early 1990s, and business conditions have deteriorated over the past year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These 10 axiomatic facts go to the point that Labor has been making for some years, and that is that we have an economy that has major challenges, an economy that is having the longest per capita recession since the terrible 1982 depression that many people endured under the Fraser years. Of course, Mr Howard was Treasurer then, as I recall. Household debt is up, business confidence is down and consumer confidence is down. Even employment growth, the one metric the government likes to boast about, pretty much coincides with population growth. That's not to say we don't welcome jobs. We welcome any new job. But let's be very clear: when you've got 1.1 million Australians looking for more work, they might be finding jobs, but they're not finding enough hours in those jobs to pay for things that matter to them. So that's what people are screaming for, that's what they're calling out for: more work in our economy. But, because of the slack in our labour market, there is no likelihood of wages just rising because of the scarcity of labour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To add to those 10 facts, there is a skill deficit in the labour market. I have been talking to many, many businesses in all sectors of the economy, and they've been talking about the problems of skill shortages in their sectors. Yet, we don't have a tertiary and vocational training system to respond readily and swiftly enough to deal with the emerging demands in the labour market. These are real structural problems and, if this government had been elected in May for the first time, I guess it could have been forgiven for its inability to respond. But this is the seventh year of this government, and yet these matters that have been before it now for years on end have not been attended to. It hasn't even made an attempt to respond to these problems. So for that reason, quite rightly, Labor calls out this government for being unable, incompetent or just indifferent to these challenges. What we need to see is a lot more effort. In my own portfolio, I would hope that the government, after six years and in its third term, would start looking at some form of industry policy to help our small and medium enterprises and even larger businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We would say that one of the reasons the economy is underperforming is that the government has a political strategy but not an economic policy. Think of the future of manufacturing. Incomprehensibly, at a time of great challenges for the global manufacturing industry, the current government has wiped its hands of any responsibility. In fact, it famously goaded a major car manufacturer to leave our shores, and of course they chose to do so the following day. That was a grave mistake, but it exemplifies, I think, the government's ideological predisposition not to help the corporate sector. The government likes to say it is the government for business, but the reality is, when you look at research and development, when you look at investment in skills, when you look at incentives for businesses to invest in research and development, it is left wanting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my engagement with business, already in the last few months in my portfolio I have seen significant concerns raised by the business community about the failure of government. I'd have a lot more to say if I had more time, including on issues around small business access to credit and many other issues, but I'm happy to leave that for another time. But this is a do-nothing government. It needs to do more. It is failing the Australian people, doing victory laps, slapping itself on the back and not really attending to its job.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:05</span>):  This economy is not working. It's not working for working Australians and it's certainly not working for Australians who need work. It's not working for Australians who get sick, who go to school or who are trying to buy their own home. It's not working for any Australian who has a bank account. Since 2013, on the Liberals' watch, growth has been at its slowest pace in 10 years. Wages have stagnated, and 1.8 million Australians are either out of work or looking for more work. Household debt is high, and living standards are going backwards. The economy is weak and getting weaker, but this Liberal government, it would appear, has no plan to turn things around. This government is operating with a political strategy rather than an economic plan. We need actual action now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of July, new data was released from the Household, Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia survey that revealed living standards have gone backwards under this Liberal government. Likewise, a recent analysis of Reserve Bank data by Fairfax newspapers reveals the costs of essential goods and services—including hospital visits, property rates and education—have climbed at twice the rate of inflation since the coalition took office in 2013. Since the final quarter of 2013, the overall consumer price index has increased 10.4 per cent, while the costs of government administered or controlled goods and services have jumped 23 per cent. Postal service prices have soared 26.8 per cent. The costs of education rose 24.9 per cent. Childcare costs climbed 26.7 per cent. The costs of medical and hospital services shot up by more than 36 per cent. Over the same period, wages grew by a mere 13.4 per cent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was backed by data released by APRA and AlphaBeta in August revealing private health insurance premiums are rising faster than wages and fewer people are taking out private health insurance at all. We are encountering record high out-of-pocket health costs, while waiting times continue to rise under this government. After stating merely weeks ago that problems in the private health sector needed to be reviewed, the Minister for Health has since claimed that the government's plan to tackle issues within private health is already working. 'There's nothing to see here,' says the government. The facts tell a very different story, with people walking away from private health insurance in droves. The entire private health sector needs to be placed under a microscope.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The costs of child care, which is an industry where costs are moderated by the federal government, have climbed 26.7 per cent since 2013. You might have heard media reports suggesting that the Liberal government took credit for a fall in childcare costs following the implementation of its ill-thought-out assistance package in 2018. In fact, the benefits were short-lived, with national figures revealing that, while childcare costs initially fell 2.7 per cent after June 2017, since the September 2017 quarter childcare costs have actually climbed 4.4 per cent. In real terms that's four times the rate of general inflation. Analysis done by my office for the electorate of Burt found evidence that, in the months following implementation of the Liberal subsidy last year, costs had gone up. Cash-strapped parents in Perth's south-eastern suburbs on average were forced to fork out up to 13 per cent more for child care than they were the previous year. We heard examples of fees going up by $115 a week since April 2018, whilst one centre increased their daily rates by a whopping $36.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has no economic policy to boost growth, wages or living standards. Australians are worried about their wages, their job security and the overall economy. The economy is clearly floundering. Wages and living standards have stagnated or are going backwards, and the Liberals clearly have no plan to turn things around. Westpac senior economist Justin Smirk told Fairfax newspapers there was a real risk that wage growth, which the bank believes will grow by just 2.5 per cent in the coming year, might start slowing even further the following year. He went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… given how well contained the wage inflation is across the nation, and between sectors, even this modest increase looks optimistic with the risks to this forecast more to the downside than upside.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest labour force figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics have served to reinforce that the economy is showing a severe case of the wobbles. Statistically, we are at a point where the percentage of adults in employment is as high as it was prior to the GFC. In June 2008, 62.9 per cent of all adults were employed compared to 62.6 per cent now. This, in real terms, means that, while the percentage of people employed is nearly back to our pre-GFC levels, the average hours worked each month by the adult population is now five per cent lower.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The drop in growth of hours worked is a serious concern, especially given it means underemployment is unlikely to improve any time soon. In July the national trend underemployment rate was 3.8 per cent and falling. In August it was 8.4. Overall, the growth in the hours worked has collapsed. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business claim to have created 1.2 million jobs since they came to office. However, the real-time information tells us those jobs were an assortment of full-time, part-time and casual placements. People are still not working the hours they want or need to get ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Global economic developments are concerning. However, this relatively recent volatility in the market does not explain Australia's overall dismal economic performance. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer are clearly in denial about the weakness in the domestic economy. That's why they've got no plan to turn things around. Last month the RBA downgraded the economic growth forecast for this year from 2¾ per cent to a below trend 2.5 per cent. These downgrades should be a wake-up call for the Morrison government. The Reserve Bank implementing the lowest interest rates in history this year is not enough to make up for the Liberals' economic mismanagement. They can't be responsible for doing all of the heavy lifting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, the Reserve Bank governor emphasised to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics that monetary policy is not the country's only option. Monetary policy certainly can help, and it is helping, but there are downsides from relying too much on monetary policy. One option is fiscal support, including through spending on infrastructure. Labor has been calling for the government to bring forward responsible spending to stimulate the economy, including bringing forward spending on infrastructure. Following last week's revelations of the economy slumping to its slowest rate of growth since the global financial crisis, there were media reports that the Prime Minister was calling on state premiers to fast-track the infrastructure spend. He backed that up in a speech to Master Builders yesterday. It turns out that the Prime Minister listens to us sometimes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this economically turbulent time, faith in our banks and financial system must also be restored. It is possible for this to be done without jeopardising any surplus. Unfortunately, the six months of inaction on the recommendations of Commissioner Hayne of the banking royal commission means that faith in our financial sector remains at an exceptionally low level. In August the Treasurer released an overdue implementation timetable that won't see many fast-tracked recommendations implemented for another 15 months, almost two years after the final report. On banking misconduct, this government has been shamed into action by the public, the media and the Labor Party. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of recommendations that were made by Commissioner Hayne could have been written into law by now. In fact, they could have been written into law prior to the federal election. In many cases, these were simple tweaks to existing legislation that would have made obvious positive changes for consumers who may otherwise be subject to further misconduct by banks and financial institutions. Labor was willing to approach this in a bipartisan manner to work with the government to push through these legislation changes as quickly as possible. That offer was never taken up. As a result, this delay means that consumers, as well as banks and financial institutions, have been left waiting in the wind on any sort of certainty about what the sector will look like in the years ahead. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals and the Nationals must stop playing political games here in Canberra and instead focus on delivering action for victims of banking misconduct and for all Australians. This government is putting the banks before the people—just like they did when they voted against a banking royal commission 26 times. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians need and expect a plan from this government to get the economy going again. GDP per capita has gone backwards over the year and, for the first time since the global financial crisis, we don't have the time for the finger-pointing and blame-shifting that has come from this government. The government seems to forget that it is the government and it is its job to present and implement an actual plan. It's time this government presented us with an economic program that will support the floundering economy and safeguard us all from global risks. This should be above politics. This is about backing the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, while what I have said is about our nation, I cannot pass up the opportunity to comment on the real-world practical impacts of the government's lack of action on the economy for the people of Perth's south-east in the electorate of Burt. In our suburbs and communities, we experience the benefits of economic upswings last and the detriments of the downswings first. This means our economic suffering is longer and is reflected in our already high and persistent unemployment rates, our even higher youth unemployment rates, our high welfare dependency, our high public housing reliance and our high crime rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many in our community have negative equity in their home and are struggling with repayments. It's up to this government to show some leadership and come up with a real plan for our economy. It is the role of government to use the policy levers at its disposal to drive national prosperity for everyone, to ensure all members of our community are not left behind. There are very real world consequences; actual people are very negatively affected when governments don't take action. This isn't about economic indicators and statistics. The government must act. The time for action is now. The people of Perth's south-east in Burt, and the people of communities like it around the country, are going backwards under this government and they won't forget it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="276714" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DAVID SMITH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  I rise to also speak in support of the appropriations bills. As other members in this chamber have noted, since 1975, Labor has taken a principled position in terms of supply. Governments are entitled to supply and to function effectively with distribution of revenue. Within that frame I note that these bills do include some expenditure that is supported by the opposition. In an era where constituents in my electorate of Bean are looking for some level of consensus, I'm happy to acknowledge that the Department of Agriculture receiving $295 million for concessional loans to farm businesses, including those affected by drought or the North Queensland flood, is a good thing. I'm happy to acknowledge that, despite the proliferation of contracting arrangements that undermine the department's capacity, it is good that Defence will receive funding to protect and advance Australia's strategic interests, to support ongoing major defence operations and to support our veterans. It is good that we're investing in programs to prevent violence against women and their children and to establish the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability. And, although late to the table, I welcome seeing the bills containing funding for the continuation of the Corporate Tax Avoidance Taskforce. That said, let's call this third government out for what it is: a government without a plan—not even 'a cunning plan' as Baldrick would have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a government without compassion and a government without a vision for Canberra and its residents who live in the Bean electorate. These bills highlight again how out of touch this third-term government is. We see cuts to the Public Service and the impact of these cuts on local communities, let alone public sector capability. We see the ongoing impact of the debacle that is the forced relocation of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority. We see the continued flawed rollout of the NBN into the Bean electorate—a matter regularly raised with my office. We see underinvestment in health services and mental health services. We see a lack of investment in transport infrastructure. We see a lack of investment and vision for the National Capital Authority. We see a lack of action in terms of a response to the inquiry into our national cultural institutions—institutions that are still struggling under an uncompromising and misinformed efficiency dividend. Finally, we see the inadequate level of the Newstart support payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the third term of this Liberal and National government, it is clear, as clear as a Canberra winter's day, that when it comes to the economy this government only has slogans. And it's difficult to get beyond slogans if you're not prepared to invest in the capability and capacity of your own workforce. Nowhere is this more apparent than in two contrasting speeches on the public service over the last couple of weeks. Andrew Podger, the former Australian public service commissioner started from first principles, restating the statutory object of having 'an apolitical public service that is efficient and effective in serving the government, the Parliament and the Australian public'. This purpose was reinforced by the High Court decision in the recent Banerji case. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Podger goes on to comment that issues identified in the 2010 Moran review have not only not been resolved but have got considerably worse. Capability deficits have grown and the 'Reliance on contractors and consultants has increased with highly doubtful … gains in value for money … and continued negative impacts on APS capabilities.' Repeated expert advice on the inappropriateness of crude efficiency dividends has been ignored and a remuneration policy across the sector is a mess. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This contrasts sharply with a speech made by the Prime Minister to the Institute of Public Administration. The Prime Minister talked about providing guideposts for the public service so that the APS can have a better understanding of how the APS can support the government and the nation. These guideposts are little more than inane catchphrases from a reserve-grade locker room: respect and expect; it's about the implementation; look at the scorecard; look beyond the bubble—a particular Canberra favourite; read the game and stay ahead of the play; and honour the code. They read and sound like the outtakes from a meeting run by David Brent at Wernham Hogg. Probably enough has been said about the Canberra bubble—suffice to say that it is farcical for resident No. 1 of the bubble to lecture working Australians to look beyond the bubble. A little self-reflection wouldn't hurt. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister then went on to attempt to narrow the scope of the public service by suggesting that the public service should have a 'laser-like focus on serving the quiet Australians' rather than all Australians. Anyone like me, a child of the seventies, would know that the quiet Australian, of course, is BHP. Perhaps this is the government's way of saying we should be servicing multinationals better. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course this is not only a convenient way of justifying doing little as, by their nature, quiet Australians won't necessarily tell you what they want or don't want, but it's also a way of shutting down dissent and directing the work of the public service away from those Australians that are the most vulnerable and in need. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Telling public servants that they need to honour the code is laughable when not only are public servants already bound by codes of conduct—codes of conduct that don't apply to the armies of contractors and consultants that outnumber them—but former ministers may have actually complied with codes of conduct but it would be difficult to argue that they have honoured them. It's even more difficult to argue that the member for Hume—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr DAVID SMITH:</span>
                    </a>  As I was saying, it is even more difficult to argue that the member for Hume has honoured such a code. 'Leading by example' is a catchphrase missing in his speech.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the elephants in the room at the institute speech, not that it appeared to be seen, was the absence of consideration of the cost and consequences of spending billions of dollars on consultants, contractors and labour hire to provide public service policy and delivery in order to effectively assist the government of the day in meeting the challenges faced by the nation. A workforce driven by commercial interests, rather than public good, conflicts directly with the objects of the Public Service Act. It erodes expertise and capability within government, putting the interests of multinationals before the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenges we face are clear and they impact the lives of all who live in Bean. The economy is floundering, many families are struggling, and the Morrison government doesn't have a plan to turn things around. The Australian economy is growing at its slowest pace since the GFC, with annual growth deteriorating further, to be half what it was one year ago. Annual GDP growth is weaker than the forecast of both the RBA and the government itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the economic record of those opposite. Under the watch of the Liberals and Nationals we have debt of more than half a trillion dollars. This government has doubled our national debt. Remember, this from the people who gave us the catchphrase 'debt and deficit disaster'. Growth is just half a per cent for the June quarter and has slowed further to 1.4 per cent for the year. For the first time since the GFC, GDP per capita has gone backwards over the year and annual GDP growth is lower than population growth. The national economy has gone from the 8th fastest growing economy in the OECD, when Labor was in government, to a sickly 20th. Wages are growing at only one-sixth the pace of the profits. Productivity, or GDP per hour worked, has gone backwards over the year. Household spending remains weak. The news is all good. Total private business investment went backwards in the quarter and over the year. As a percentage of nominal GDP, it is around its lowest level since the early 1990s recession.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Long-term unemployment remains high and has continued to grow since the Liberal-National government was elected. Underemployment remains at a high rate—estimated now to be around nine per cent. Retail sales are trending down. This government's record locally is further highlighted by the data in the HILDA report released in July. It showed that living standards have gone backwards under the Liberal-National government, and, as has been pointed out before, it shows that people are actually earning less now in real terms than they were in 2013, when this government was elected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The HILDA report showed significant falls right here in the ACT in median household incomes, adjusting for household size. In fact, the drop of 11 per cent was the largest of any region in Australia. This was a direct consequence of the decimation of the Public Service and the cuts in real wages for many hardworking Canberra public servants and their families. This current economic situation is an indictment of this third-term government and the Liberal representation of the ACT in this government. After six years of this government, the Prime Minister shouldn't just dismiss these longstanding homegrown weaknesses. We know that his home affairs minister is distracted, off making rather odd and, some would say, laughable music videos, but the Prime Minister shouldn't be. The RBA is already doing the heavy lifting, having cut the cash rate to one-third of the emergency lows seen during the GFC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After two postelection rate cuts, the third-term Liberal-National government has no plan for growth. This nation and my electorate need a plan for investing in skills, a plan for investing in high-quality education, a plan for investing in science and research and a plan for investing in Australian jobs. The people in my electorate of Bean need a government that's prepared to invest in local infrastructure, a government that's prepared to invest in education and skills to make sure that the young people in the electorate of Bean have the opportunity of a world-class education, a government that is prepared to invest in a strong, apolitical public service, not one continually undermined and compromised by the unfettered growth in contracting, consulting and outsourcing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government likes to pretend that it's doing a good job of managing the economy, but, as I've outlined, the facts tell a much different story. Our labour spokesperson, Jim Chalmers, has said that Labor supports these appropriation bills, but we don't support the approach of the Prime Minister and his Treasurer. I agree, and he is right in calling on the third-term Liberal-National government to bring forward a budget update so their forecast can be adjusted and they can responsibly fund a proper and broad economic plan to get the economy moving again. We're not the only ones calling for a plan, or at least some further action. The Reserve Bank governor, no less, has called for more infrastructure investment sooner. Menzies would be proud of this government's inertia on the economy. They are asleep at the wheel with no plan. Without insulting every C-grade golfer—and I am one—those opposite are the Sunday hackers of economic stewardship. They are deep in the rough and they have no plan to get back on the fairway—a fairway, I might add, that was laid down by Labor governments past.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's lack of plan also extends to many other areas, from education and skills to the NDIS. I'm on the record in calling on this third-term government to also invest in increasing the Newstart payment—not purely because of the toll it takes on people living on such a low payment; it makes sense economically. We need to get consumer spending moving, and this would help drive that forward. Rather than undermining the dignity of Australians by suggesting we should drug test them, I suggest the government invest instead in giving them a fair go to get back on their feet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to vocational education, the Liberals have presided over a crisis in the sector. Vocational education has been attacked day after day by privatisation, poor regulation and unhealthy competition among dodgy providers gouging the system. Since coming to office, this government has cut $3.6 billion from our vocational education and training sector. A consequence of this has been that traineeships and apprenticeships have more than halved at a time when we should be skilling our nation. We need a world-class schools and education sector where no child is left behind and where we are educating the next generation for the jobs and skills of the future. Not only do the students and teachers in these schools need this investment; we need it for the economic growth it will bring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst, no doubt, the NDIS has been a landmark Labor initiative, it has been neglected by three Liberal governments. It's not an exaggeration to say that the ideology that has driven the decision to place a staffing cap on the NDIA has been catastrophic and creates systemic problems so significant that we now have a delivery model unable to provide for all people in need of support in Bean and other electorates around the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In short, we are still waiting for a government reply into a report on the opportunities presented to our regional economy here by our magnificent cultural institutions. We also have a National Capital Authority that is doing what it can with what it has but can't keep the ponds out the front of Old Parliament House operational. We've individuals across the electorate being wrongly hassled through robodebt letters. We have members of the coalition trying to undermine superannuation increases and to even have superannuation not apply to low-income Australians. We have the ever-expanding use of contractors, driven by the departmentwide staff cap. This is a third-term government without any decent level of planning. It does not even have a cunning plan like Baldrick so often had.</span>

                    <a href="264121" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WELLS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  I rise today on a matter of great importance to my home state of Queensland in the best country in the world and the greatest nation on earth—that is, the fate of the NRL grand final in 2021. We are all still reeling over the decision for the 2020 grand final to go to the Sydney Cricket Ground, a decision that could modestly be described as a travesty. Now we hear that the fate of the 2021 grand final is at stake because delays and mismanagement of the New South Wales government mean that the stadium will not be ready in time. This is a disaster, but it's one that Queenslanders are here to help with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should bring the NRL 2021 grand final to Suncorp Stadium, the spiritual home of rugby league, because if you want something done right, you should give it to Queenslanders. I posit that the only reason southern teams don't want this is cowardice. If you think that you can win it only when you play at home then I ask the question: have you ever truly won it? I call upon New South Wales to relinquish their hold on the 2021 grand final and send it to the spiritual home of rugby league, Suncorp Stadium.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also rise today to speak about the lethargy of this budget in addressing the significant policy challenges of our coming generations. Economic growth has been slow for a decade, Australia's population is ageing and climate change looms. The burden of these changes falls mainly on the young. Young people face real concerns about housing affordability, stagnating wealth and incomes, and future budget pressures. It is a wonderfully conservative idea to carry on about the Left redistributing wealth when they themselves actively seek to redistribute it in the other direction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under neoliberal policies of deregulation, privatisation and austerity, our living standards have declined sharply. People have lost jobs. People have lost benefits. People have lost much of the safety net that used to make these losses less frightening. They see a future for their kids that looks even more foreboding than their precarious present.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Millennials are earning, when you adjust for inflation, about 20 per cent less than our parents did at the same age. Younger Australians are much less likely to own a home than their parents were at the same age. Homeownership rates for 30-year-olds fell from 65 per cent in 1981 to 45 per cent in 2016. The wealth of households under 35 has barely moved since 2004. Poorer younger Australians have gone even further backwards. Youth unemployment is around double the national average, and in my home state of Queensland it is as high as 25 per cent in the regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This week the Grattan Institute has confirmed with fresh figures that the cost of housing is contributing to the rising gap between rich and poor. It is making the gap between disposable household incomes bigger. It is making the gap between net household wealth bigger. And it's making the gap between any prosperity in our prospective futures much bigger.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amid this growing inequality we have witnessed the rise of the Davos class—a hyperconnected network of banking, tech and media billionaires, elected leaders who are cosy with those interests, and influencer celebrities who make the whole palaver seem unbearably glamorous. For too many Australians, success is a party to which they are not invited. They know in their hearts that this rising wealth and power is linked to their growing debts and powerlessness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So that's the problem. That is the storm of circumstances which this budget stood to address and those are the circumstances that formed the landscape upon which the election was fought. Where did we land? A budget where mincing management triumphed over reform, and an election where fear triumphed over hope. The coalition called Labor's reform agenda an age war and stoked retiree anger directed at policies designed to address intergenerational inequality. They did other things too. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be wrong to allow intergenerational inequality to be pushed off the agenda on the basis of the election result. Progress does not move in a straight line; it zigs and zags. The concerns faced by young Australians are real, and they will remain. As we stand here in the new term of the parliament of 2019, these problems loom as some of the largest unaddressed policy voids in our country, affecting our largest generation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in my first speech, this year is remarkable because it is the first year where more Australians are born after 1980 than before. It's such a bold statistic that I usually have to say it twice: there are now more Australians born after 1980 than before. Millennials are also older than you realise. The oldest millennials are already pushing 40. The youngest are out of high school or even out of uni, depending on where you draw the birth line. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we all have in common is that we all came of age in the shadow of the global financial crisis. Economists can tell us what happened to previous generations who came of age in recessions. The generation that came of age during the Great Depression endured a protracted period of economic stagnation that prevented them from finding their economic feet. But that was followed by a period of jump-started economic growth that lasted for the second half of their working lives in the 1950s and 1960s. They had an opportunity to catch up. Where is that boom for millennials going to come from? Not this year's budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got quite a few problems with this year's budget, but in order to stay tightly relevant to millennials today I am going to speak about just two: the failures to address rising inequality with respect to housing and wages. During the Howard government years, policies were introduced that put the cost of owning a home out of reach for an entire generation in major capital cities. The Howard government introduced capital gains tax concessions leading Australians to shift their wealth into property investment at a far higher rate than the vast majority of the rest of the world. The concept of million-dollar homes was until very recently seen as the top echelon of housing. Now it is the median price in the largest city in Australia. Housing prices have increased from four times the median income in the nineties to seven times the median income now. It's eight times in Sydney.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Housing markets are crucial to the divided fortunes of the younger and older generations. At the height of the property boom, the average capital gain for a regular house in Sydney was higher than the average annual earnings. In other words, for a lot of workers, their houses earned more than they did. High house prices make it substantially harder for young people to save for a deposit. There is a lot of chat getting around about smashed avocadoes, but the truth is that if millennials dialled back the avocado toast to spend only what our parents spent on eating out, it would still take between 100 and 113 years to save a twenty per cent deposit on the median home, depending on where you are. Brunch has become a convenient scapegoat for structural inequality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what's the government's plan? There were no new measures in the budget this year for first home buyers or owners. None. We will only overcome this policy paralysis when we are brave enough to challenge the cognitive dissonance that characterises our national thinking: we want house prices to continue to rise at the same time that we want young people to get a foot on the housing ladder. The figure lying at the heart of this dynamic is $8 billion per year—the annual subsidy the federal government now provides to the private housing market. As federal representatives, we owe any annual funding commitment of $8 billion per year the provision of our scrutiny. We should assure ourselves that there is no better way the budget can spend this money to improve housing affordability for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Concerning wages growth, the assumptions made by the government in this budget are wildly flattering. The government would have us believe that the labour market will stay as it is now, but our employers will all want to pay us more. In reality, economic pressures on young people have been exacerbated by wage stagnation and rising underemployment. If this is the new normal, we will bear witness to a new generation moving through adulthood with lower incomes than the generations before it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Three backbench Liberal MPs wrote that the government's foreshadowed IR reforms would boost productivity, create more good jobs, lift wages and boost international competitiveness—all at once. Everyone will have 'control over their destiny'. To me, it looks like people throwing away the umbrella in a rainstorm because they themselves aren't getting wet. Conservatives and business lobbyists claim the current system is union dominated, but union membership, union activity and enterprise agreement coverage have all declined dramatically. Where unions are absent, wage theft and the erosion of employee protections are rife, and ethical businesses that comply with the law are placed at a competitive disadvantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem has not been an absence of productivity growth; our productivity can be always improved. But real wages are already far behind what productivity growth is occurring. The bigger problem is the failure to share the benefits of productivity growth. International evidence is clear that stronger worker rights and collective bargaining also tend to result in a better distribution of income, both among workers and between workers and firms. In other words, better worker rights lead to a larger economic pie that gets more evenly distributed. We could look to Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands and Japan—places where collective bargaining is accepted and even nurtured as a healthy, positive economic feature. Countries with more collaborative and balanced IR systems are eating our lunch in international competition, as my old bosses used to say. The solution to that challenge cannot be to suppress wages even further or disempower and fragment workers even more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Generation-on-generation progress in living standards has been the happy dividend of Australia's strong economic performance since the Second World War. On average—and I will address intergenerational inequality at another opportunity—children could expect to be substantially healthier, wealthier and better housed than their parents at the same age. This generational progress can no longer be taken for granted. Our Australian covenant of trust that one generation will look after the next stands to fall. Every generation faces its unique challenges, but letting this generation fall behind the others would surely be a legacy that none of us would be proud of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These fundamental questions should be addressed by any federal budget, and they weren't. In this new parliamentary term it is dispiriting to witness a government acting like the dogs who caught the car rather than getting down to work on these problems. Many Australians have rage fatigue and moral exhaustion from the election and from watching the state of affairs abroad in Trump's America and in the mess of Brexit. It hurts to see the young and the vulnerable in a vice grip and to see the things that we have fought for sabotaged. Most days, I am approached by someone who feels dismayed at what has become of us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my first speech I spoke about being galvanised through the resistance. But I want to spend these last moments here talking about what it means to be the opposition. You oppose something by standing up to it but also by being its opposite. It means being compassionate and inclusive where they are cold and exclusionary. It means being committed to accuracy and precision where they are sloppy with the truth and the facts or, when it comes to climate change, at total war with them. It also means preserving your greatest effort for the true battles over the course of our future—battles like this one—and preserving the memory of how people before us have opposed and resisted and won.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Progress does not move in a straight line. It zigs and zags. We do not have every answer. In this global climate of rising inequality, there are questions not yet asked waiting for us in the near recesses of the future. What our constituents ask of us is that they can know what to expect of us in the face of future dilemmas that no-one anticipates yet. Here is where I stand. Intergenerational inequality is immoral, and it is a crisis looming upon our nation. I'm restless with the task of solutions not yet started.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-GeneralBold">)</span> (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  In accordance with standing order 149, the Federation Chamber will first consider the schedule of the bill. I would like to remind all members of the purpose of the consideration in detail stage and outline the way it is expected to proceed. Shortly, the chamber will be asked to agree to a proposed schedule for the times for consideration of portfolios. This may need to be varied, but it is a useful guide to assist ministers and members to arrange their commitments. Chairs will not be seeking to enforce this arrangement strictly.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consideration in detail is a debate, and the call will be alternated between the government and non-government sides, as always. Even though this debate sometimes takes the format of questions and answers, this is not question time. Ministers and government backbench members both will be considered as speakers on the government side and should bear this in mind when they seek the call. All speakers are required to be relevant to whichever portfolio is being examined, but there is no requirement of direct relevance in respect of any responses. It might be practical for ministers to respond to more than one speaker when they seek the call. I note that this general arrangement applied last year and seemed to allow maximum participation in this stage of debate.</span>

Ministers may wish to make an introductory statement when debate on their portfolio begins, but, as they are not moving amendments, that is a matter for them to decide.</span>

We are investing in the early years by funding preschool to support 15 hours per week in the year before school. We are improving school student outcomes by providing record and guaranteed needs based school funding, an extra $37.7 billion—an increase, on average, of 62 per cent per student—and securing the agreement of every state and territory to our plan to lift student results. We are supporting students with a disability through record and growing funding. This includes a contribution to help schools meet the cost of educational adjustments provided to students with a disability for their learning needs. From 2018 to 2029, the government will invest an estimated $28.8 billion for the students with a disability loading. On average, funding for students with a disability will grow by 5.1 per cent each year over this period.</span>

Our childcare reforms have made child care more affordable, with nearly one million families reaping the benefits. We abolished the annual subsidy cap for more than 80 per cent of families, allowing them to work as many days as they choose without losing their childcare subsidy when they hit the cap. If a parent can work and wants to work, we want to make it easier for them to access child care.</span>

This will benefit approximately 350,000 children and builds on the previous decision to provide Commonwealth support for preschool until the end of 2019.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additional priorities to support quality schooling in 2019-20 include $30.2 million for the Local Schools Community Fund to assist students through the provision of equipment, upgrades or programs at the local school level, and a further $15 million over three years, from 2019-20, for Teach for Australia to train high-achieving teachers who will become high-quality school leaders in rural, remote or disadvantaged schools. I will continue as the process takes place.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  Of course, this is another disappointing budget when it comes to education, particularly in the way that it locks in cuts to public schooling. The government has restored funding to Catholic and independent schools and we on this side have welcomed that restoration of funding. What's critically missing from this budget, though, is the restoration of funding cuts from public schools. So, while 99 per cent of private schools will reach or exceed 100 per cent of the schooling resource standard under this formula, public schools in seven states and territories will never, never reach their fair funding level. On average, this means that states will miss out on about $6,500 per student by the end of this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2017 there's been no Commonwealth funding for capital improvements to public schools despite enrolments in public schools increasing by about 150,000 students in the last five years. The minister was boasting about a $30 million fund for school projects. On this side, at the last election we committed $260 million for school upgrades across Australia, including projects like the science labs at Mount Eliza Secondary College in the electorate of Dunkley.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An ABC report just recently showed that, between 2013 and 2017, the four richest schools in the country—the four richest schools in the country!—spent more on facilities and renovations than the poorest 1,800 schools combined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Disability funding for students went backwards in five states and territories—the ACT, the Northern Territory, WA, South Australia and Tasmania—between 2017 and 2018, while, of course, in contrast, Labor would have invested an extra $300 million. In the six years that this government has been in office—enough time for a student to start and finish high school—NAPLAN results have been going backwards in many areas. We have seen falling scores in international tests as well—literacy, numeracy and science tests. On some measures Russia, Estonia, Vietnam and many other countries have overtaken us. Combined with the fact that the mark you need to get into initial teacher education continues to fall it is not a pretty picture. Countries such as Singapore and Finland, with highly successful education systems, aim to take their teachers from the top 30 per cent of academic achievers. We see them consistently performing better than Australian students in many of these international tests because they are attracting and retaining high-performing students into teaching. That shows how important the work is. It shows how much we respect and value our teachers when we target the best students to draw them into teaching so they can teach the next generation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to have a proper evidence based approach to make sure we're using international best practice. And 18 months since the so-called Gonski 2.0 review, where the previous education minister said he was prepared to accept all of the recommendations of the review, it is very difficult to see where those improvements have happened. One of the improvements that has been consistently argued for, not just in the Gonski 2.0 review but by Labor and many others in the education sector, is to have an evidence institute for schools. We know, for example, that we use evidence all the time in our health system to improve clinical outcomes for patients. Patients who are on a clinical trial do better than other patients because they are closely observed, closely monitored and getting the best and newest state-of-the-art intervention. Why aren't we doing the same for our schools?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to ask the minister why he has not yet allocated any funding for an evidence institute. In contrast, Labor allocated $280 million for an evidence institute for schools. The government have said they support the initiative. If they genuinely do support the initiative, it would be terrific to see some of the funding provided for it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="109556" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  Few investments we make are more important than the investments we make in education. We have a responsibility to ensure that we're passing on the best of our knowledge to younger generations and that we're equipping them for whatever endeavours they'll undertake and also to contribute in meaningful ways to the life of the Australia we know and love.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two matters that I want to raise today. One area that should concern those of us in this building particularly is education relating to civics and citizenship. This is about more than just teaching people how to vote; it's about helping people understand how Australia was founded and the rules and framework around how we're governed. Too many Australians don't know we have a constitution, let alone what the Constitution contains. We should be concerned by the results in the latest National Assessment Program for Civics and Citizenship released in 2017. Just 38 per cent of year 10 students were at a proficient standard in their civics and citizenship knowledge. For a country that has compulsory voting this is very concerning. If citizens do not know what their citizenship confers and what rules guide, shape and limit the power of our parliament, their ability to make well-informed decisions and uphold that constitution into the future is weakened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is tragic because the Constitution belongs not to lawyers or academics or any other group, but to all Australians. The Australian Constitution sets the rules about how we're governed. No Prime Minister and no government can rewrite those rules without the permission of the people. The way we have organised our political life takes the wisdom of other democracies formed before us, but it is a uniquely Australian document that gives us a safe and stable form of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second matter I want to raise as an area of concern is phonics education for our young Australians who are learning to read. Again, our standardised testing in Australia has shown that literacy standards are not what they should be. There's a large amount of well-established research that's shown this over the years: a person needs to be immersed in oral language, they need to be read or spoken to, but they also need to crack the code for how letters and sounds work together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Georgina Perry, executive officer of SPELD NSW, said: 'Learning to read is like learning to ride a bike or learning to swim. Students need explicit instructions and lots of opportunities for practice. Learning phonics skills is an essential part of students learning to read.' Some children will crack the code for themselves. They'll piece together how sounds, language and letters work without having it explicitly taught to them, but many will not. It's important that we're able to identify early on those children who are not grasping those steps and for whom reading is therefore becoming an obstacle instead of a gateway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard of too many stories of young people who reach high school in Australia having somehow missed learning one of the most important things they should have grasped in their early years of schooling. They've turned up to school each day and cleverly copied other students or hidden their inability to read. They reach late high school often having behavioural problems or a high level of anxiety because their whole learning has been compromised by missing out on those tools in their earliest years. We need to identify early on the students who are not acquiring the reading tools they need so that it can be remedied before the consequences for that person become severe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In England the phonics screening check has been in place since 2011. The screening test allows teachers to identify the children who might need some extra support in learning to read. It's a non-threatening, simple test that gives important information to schools. The phonics check in England has been coupled with mandatory phonics teaching in schools, and the results show that over a three-year period the proportion of students reaching the expected standard has increased from 58 per cent to 77 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2017 the South Australian government trialled a year 1 phonics test, and the evaluation showed some important things. Firstly, the trial showed that students in that state are not learning phonics adequately. Only 15 per cent of the children in the South Australian trial reached the level of competence that 81 per cent of children in the UK reached. In the evaluation of that trial, teachers and school leaders said that students did more poorly than expected. This is helpful information for teachers to know what they need to focus more time on in their classrooms. It was encouraging to discover that students were positive about and engaged in the tests. They weren't anxious or stressed out. Similarly, teachers were largely positive, finding the data useful and the resources very helpful. I'll quote again from Georgina Perry: 'The phonics check is a valuable tool as it helps teachers confirm their students are learning essential phonics skills and may help identify those students who are having difficulty learning to read.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, given the importance of civics and phonics education and the room for improvement we have in both of these areas, can you outline how the government is investing in improving civics and phonics education in this year's federal budget?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to question the government on their education spending. For a party who loves to say, 'If you have a go, you will get a go,' this budget does so little to give our kids a go. There's no more crucial role for government than delivering an education system which acts as the greatest social equaliser and offers the best chance at opportunities for anyone who wants to take it. On that measure, the budget gets a big F for fail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Cooper, education is the No. 1 issue raised with me. Labor's policy of offering free kinder to three- and four-year-olds would have been life-changing, parents told me. Yet here the minister sings the government's praises of their policy. We know that they're only funding preschool on a year-by-year basis, which leaves little hope for the teachers, parents and kids in that sector that there's any future for it. Labor wants to see real needs based, sector-blind funding for all schools so that all kids at every school get a great education, but that premise fails when you fail to properly fund schools and public schools in particular.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals have ripped $14 billion from public-school funding, so nine in 10 schools across the country will never reach their fair funding level. Little wonder we see our results in the basics—reading, writing and maths—going backwards in every state and territory. That is why we are angry that this budget and the election of another Liberal government locks in an inequitable funding formula. Let's be clear: this is for the schools that teach two-thirds of Australian children, the majority of children in remote and rural areas, the majority of Indigenous children, the majority of children with a disability and the majority of children from a CALD background. These kids are missing out under this Liberal government. How are the kids at these schools supposed to have a go when their government systematically underfunds them?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor had a plan to fix this. Labor would have restored the $14 billion, especially for public schools who have had that money ripped away from them under the Liberals. With this money, and increased autonomy for principals, public schools would have been able to deliver smaller class sizes, more teachers and more one-to-one attention. But, perhaps more crucially for schools in my electorate, this boost in funding could have been used to deliver additional supports like speech pathologists, social workers and family liaison officers as well as smaller class sizes and additional teachers. Without additional supports, our teachers are more stretched than ever, and it's showing in our declining education results. To support our students, we need to let teachers teach and we need to provide enough funding to ensure schools have wraparound services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other key issue for schools in my electorate is the dire need for building works. Many public schools are quite simply falling down. This budget contains a measly $30.2 million from which every public, independent and Catholic school in Australia has to compete for one-off grants of between $1,000 and $20,000. Compare this to Labor's commitment of $260 million in local school commitments to give schools in every electorate the upgrades they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Worse, this government has a special fund, called the Capital Grants Program, that's for private schools, and that will deliver $1.9 billion in grants from 2018 to 2027. There's no equivalent fund for public schools. In the last two years alone, more than $311 million has already been allocated to 314 private schools. A recent ABC investigation revealed the stark and shocking disparity in the levels of capital expenditure in Australian schools. Between 2013 and 2017 the four richest schools in the country spent more on facilities and renovations than the poorest 1,800 schools combined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite see this portfolio as a place holder—something to cut and somewhere to find savings. We on this side of the chamber understand the value of education. We see this portfolio as a way of building aspiration and productivity and of unlocking creativity and potential in the future of our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we announced Labor's funding, I spoke to Thornbury High School's principal, Michael Keenan. He told me that such a substantial funding increase would make a difference to Thornbury High School in helping them achieve their twin goals of equity and excellence. All students would have benefited. Every student, no matter where they are in their learning journey, deserves an outstanding, fully-resourced education—that was the principal of Thornbury High School in my electorate. They have two goals: equity and excellence—goals this budget so badly fails. After six years, how can the Australian people expect good or improved results if this budget locks in inequities through funding?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Education</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  Can I continue to outline the additional money we're putting into education—and I know the previous member on this side, the member for Berowra, will be very pleased by this. It includes $10.8 million over three years from 2019-20 to provide a year 1 voluntary phonics health check so parents and teachers can ensure their children are not falling behind. South Australia has introduced a phonics check for grade 1, and it's something that we're encouraging every other state and territory to follow suit on. If children and parents can get an assessment at that age about where they're at when it comes to their literacy, you can give the support and the help that they need to make sure those students don't fall behind. As we know, literacy and numeracy are absolutely fundamental foundations of a child's education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also $9.5 million over four years from 2019-20 for online teaching and learning courses to strengthen the capacity of teachers across Australia to teach mathematics and phonics through freely-available nationally-coordinated high-quality professional learning and resources. We want teachers to have the tools to be able to educate children when it comes to literacy and numeracy. Other initiatives include a further $5 million over three years from 2019-20 for Life Education to develop a new range of free training resources to help teachers better support the social and emotional needs of school students. There is also $4 million in 2019 to provide support for North Queensland flood-affected schools to help them address unforeseen challenges and remain financially viable as they provide support to students, families and teachers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I announced these funding outcomes with the member for Herbert at an event in Townsville on 7 June 2019. I'm pleased that we were able to assist 25 school communities—15 independent schools and 10 Catholic schools—to recover from the floods. And I was also able to work cooperatively with the Queensland minister who also made sure that government schools received the funding that they need. They did the government schools; we looked after the non-government sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the member will also be pleased, because he is a strong supporter of this, about $2 million over two years from 2019-20 for the Australian Constitution Centre to support the establishment of a wide-reaching educational outreach program which will enable more Australian school students to obtain a greater understanding of Australia's constitutional framework. Can I commend you for the work that you did in promoting this. I think it is an excellent initiative and, when it is combined—and this hasn't been funded in the budget but it is something that we are funding—with the changes to the PACER program, it will mean more students will be able to afford to come from remote, rural and regional areas to Canberra as part of that program. These are two initiatives in that civic space which I think will make a big difference. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want to go on about what the opposition says when it comes to what we are doing with regard to school funding, but I think it is incredibly important that we just put the facts on the table. In 2018 we provided $7.38 billion to government schools. In 2019 that goes to $7.98 billion; 2020, $8.66 billion; 2021, $9.31 billion; 2022, $10.1 billion; and 2023, $10.74 billion. Funding for government schools in every year that we have been in office has gone up, and we are providing an increase of 62 per cent per student. And, for all members, the government spending is growing fastest for state schools at around 6.4 per cent per student each year from 2019 to 2023. I'll just repeat that: government spending is growing fastest for state schools at around 6.4 per cent per student each year from 2019 to 2023. I thought we had put this issue to bed, but if the opposition wants to keep raising it we'll keep providing the facts.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  My question is obviously to the education minister. In the context of his previous comments, obviously when he came to office the kids that were in prep are now coming up to the end of their time in primary school. The kids that started high school are now out in the workforce or at university learning or earning. I know that when the coalition started in office there was a certain number of school students. Now, in 2019, there are more school students. I taught English for 11 years, not maths, so I'm a little bit shaky on this, but I think if there are more school students there'll be more money connected with educating those students. So, whilst I appreciate his ability to teach grade 1 maths, I think he needs to go back to the core promise. Because I remember the then opposition leader Tony Abbott saying before he was elected, 'You can vote Labor. You can vote Liberal. Not a dollar difference to education.' I think it was at Panthers leagues club he made that statement—the former Prime Minister in the progression of prime ministers we've had.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then what happened? One of the first acts of the coalition government—under Treasurer Morrison, in fact—was they cut $30 billion over the decade from projected school funding, and it showed up in their budget papers. And they have fundamentally failed to restore cuts. They keep saying there are more kids in schools so we give more money but they actually never addressed that fundamental broken promise. I look forward to the minister addressing that response. We know that by not investing in our students they are failing our future. They're not only failing our children; they're failing our future—the people that will have to look after us. </span>

                    </a>  If you don't want to govern, you can feel free to leave the parliament. You're paid to actually govern. Obviously that means looking after our literacy and numeracy results. The results have gone back. The best we can say is that they've essentially flatlined. For eighth grade maths scores on the TIMSS international test, Australia is ranked 18th. Russia is seventh. So we're now more than 10 places behind Russia. For reading literacy in fourth grade, PIRLS has Russia ranked first and Australia trailing in 14th place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at some of the reasons for that. I particularly want to acknowledge the great work that teachers and teaching support staff do to run schools—and I know we've got former teachers on this side of the chamber. The member for Lalor has run schools as a principal. But we know that they're being asked to do more with less under this government. There are more demands on their time. Teachers are spending so much of their time doing admin, collecting data on kids with disabilities and the like. It is a very stressful time for teachers and the other staff at the moment. It's actually driving good teachers away. We're getting fewer high achievers choosing teaching as a career path, particularly when compared to other OECD nations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely we can all agree that we want the best people, the best educators, teaching our children—my children, your children and those in years to come. Look at Singapore, Finland and other countries. They're recruiting top teaching graduates. We should recruit from that top third of student cohorts to educate our students. Currently it is not good enough. The quality of our teachers is obviously a serious issue. A principal sets the tone, but the teachers are at the chalkface, so to speak. The only plan the coalition government have to improve teaching standards is basically online training for teachers. They need to look at adopting some of our policies. So my big question to the minister is: can the minister confirm that, in the time the Liberals have been in office, NAPLAN reading, writing and maths results have decreased across all age groups, in every state and territory? As education experts and industry have panned your education policies as window-dressing, why, after six years, do this government have no long-term plan for education in Australia?</span>

                    </a>  Thank you. I want to mention the unique student identifier and, in particular, the progress that is being achieved with the USI. Since 1 January 2015 we've had the USI in place, particularly in vocational education, for international students, for Australian students studying overseas and for New Zealand students studying here in Australia. I for one was really encouraged by Gonski 2.0 and their recommendation that we move more broadly to a USI. I understand that's the intention of government and has bipartisan support, which is important. I want to go through some of the big opportunities that come with the USI and some of the forgone opportunities in a policy sense, in a quality sense, of not having one and encourage us to move in this direction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A USI offers opportunities as early, potentially, as the early education phase. There has been lots of commitment on both sides of the House in the zero to eight years and, more specifically, the 18 months to five years stage. With the jurisdictional challenge of talking here in Canberra but ultimately not actually directly running a school, we want to see that students are absolutely ready to go when they hit prep. We know there are slightly different rules about access to preschool in each of the jurisdictions, but what is lacking is the ability to track a student from early education all the way through to prep and then onwards through to either a vocation or a higher education path.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it costing us at the moment in the early education space? Quite simply, in many cases we don't yet have effective cooperation to identify, at an early stage, struggling and vulnerable students prior to their arriving at prep. We've got to take pressure off teachers. As has been pointed out, there's plenty of experience on the other side, with teachers who now serve in this place. You'd well know just how much impact struggling students in prep can have. The AEDI points that out. In most parts of Australia, even relatively wealthy parts of Australia, up to 15 per cent of students in prep, from that sample done in the AED Census, are deemed as vulnerable in at least one of those five domains. So it's a serious business, and we know that the earlier we intervene the better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had significant overseas models considered here in Australia. There's always a temptation to develop your own models. But Abecedarian, which has come out of the University of North Carolina, is probably the largest enhanced reading and early intervention model in the world and has been culturally tested in every corner. It has been picked up by Queensland and the Northern Territory. Congratulations to them. Initially, it went out of the University of Melbourne. But the then Newman LNP government in Queensland invested, and Labor, right on their tail, continued these regional coordinators to try to identify students that were falling behind in that early education space. Actually, it's not just about therapy; it's not just about doctors and therapists. It's enhanced education as well, and that's not just a matter of sitting kids in circles and reading to a group; it's one to one. That kind of intervention, I hope, will yield dividends in Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's the problem and how is it related to the USI? Well, the issue is—to take one example—that a Catholic Centrecare childcare centre still can't provide data on the progress of students to the prep class over the fence in the Catholic primary school. I think that's completely unacceptable. There have been repeated conversations with Catholic Education about this issue. They continue to cite privacy and lack of consent from parents as a reason not to do so much as send their prep teacher down to talk with Centrecare about the kids over the fence. This is unbelievable. This is absolutely unacceptable in a developed economy, and I'll keep saying it to Catholic Education. They need to work together. These children are on a continuum. It's not good enough to say, 'We're going to go and have a little chat a few months before they come into prep.' You've got to start when those children arrive in early learning. You've got to raise the capacity of your early learning workers to identify children who are vulnerable. And you need parental consent when you enrol in the Centrecare preschool so that if there is a problem you can actually pull in allied heath workers. At the moment, that is something that needs to happen.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fundamental element of the USI, and this is more relevant to ministries like employment, is the skilling initiatives of the current government. Over $500 million is being invested. They recognise that in the absence of a USI you can't adequately track a student all the way through the vocational pathway. The student effectively falls into a blind dustbin of vocational education where it's a tick—you pass or fail—and we don't know if foundation skills are improving. You can't have a nation at the cutting edge of the world's economies if you're not pushing the foundation skills of literacy and numeracy in your vocational cohort. They're either getting a certificate or they're not. It's not good enough. I hope the USI will be a way of changing that. Minister, I'd really appreciate understanding and knowing the progress that we're achieving with the USI.</span>

In Victoria, of course, we've changed that slightly, but it is still ridiculous that an auditor can tell a principal in Victoria that they can't say that a child isn't attending school because they might be attending the Catholic sector school around the corner. This means that we've got children who are lost to the system, and the impetus and the funding to follow them up is also needed. I can only imagine that happening more and more across the country, so I do support those notions and we encourage the minister to take on board those thoughts and, perhaps, some research around the fundamental need for this and the value of anything that has a cost to put it into place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, we're doing NAPLAN testing and other testing, but without the systems to ensure that we can track student performance and provide the levels of support that families and teachers need we're working in circles. That brings me to this year's budget. I've been here for six years. I've said a thousand times since I walked through the door that the original Gonski research showed clearly—as does the research conducted around PISA and the OECD—that student outcomes have a direct link to inequality. You can't get around it. You can't jump over it. It's a fact. We have decades of data that demonstrate exactly that. So when those opposite start screaming, 'We're spending more, we're spending more,' having capped what will be spent in state schools to 20 per cent of the Commonwealth spend, they are continuing to feed the inequity that will have a negative impact on our student outcomes nationally. It is really that simple. And this government refuses to hear it. They refuse to hear it in the original Gonski research. They used the Gonski label again to bring in what is now an abomination of a great idea. It really is as simple as that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have specific questions that link to my electorate, in this specific area. Minister, I want to know why Westbourne Grammar School receives three times more from the Commonwealth than Werribee Secondary College. It's a really simple question. I want to know why a private school with an ICSEA of 1,147 receives three times as much money from the Commonwealth as a local state school—that, I might add, is performing better and does all sorts of things well—is receiving from the Commonwealth. You can say it's a state school as many times as you like, but the fact of the matter is that the Commonwealth budget is being focused to independent and private schools and adding to inequity. I think you missed the opening point. This inequity will lead to the detriment of this country. This is an economic issue. We're talking about making sure that we have a positive, vibrant economy. Education isn't a cost. It is a value.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have some other questions for the minister. Under his arrangements, state schools in my electorate have failed to meet the SRS standard without the equity loadings. But there are a couple that are already above it. They might be at 21 per cent. Minister, will they lose that one per cent, with your cap at 20 per cent? Will they lose that one per cent they've got, because of the loading, or is the loading outside that 20 per cent cap? And when will the government make the changes needed to ensure quality teacher training? For six years we've been aware that this is an issue. It's time for action. How can the Commonwealth justify outlaying 80 per cent of SRS to private and independent Catholic schools while only doing 20 per cent—when it is clear on any measure that 75 per cent of students are educated in the state sector?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a final point that I think is really important, Minister, and I haven't raised it with you before. There are currently 229,000 people here on bridging visas. How do we get those kids into schools? There are lots of them. At the moment, their parents can't afford education and they are locked out of our state system.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Education</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  Before I go on detailing all the extra investment we're putting into our education system, I'd like to address the member for Bowman's question and the show of bipartisanship on the other side, which is greatly appreciated, around the unique student identifier. As part of the national reform initiatives, there are three initiatives that the Commonwealth is taking the lead on. One is the unique student identifier. This is, I think, one of the most important initiatives of the whole national reform process. By taking the lead, we're making sure we're driving outcomes, when it comes to states and territories, pushing for the introduction of the USI. This will be on the agenda when I meet with state and territory education ministers on Friday, and when we meet again in Alice Springs at the end of the year we hope to have a lot of detail to put out there as to how the USI will work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly enough—I know the member for Bowman will be interested in this and I think other members will be as well—as part of the 2019-20 budget the Australian government is investing $15.8 million, over four years, to extend the unique student identifier from vocational education and training to higher education. From 2021 new domestic and onshore international higher education students will receive a USI, and by 2023 all higher education students, including those who commence prior to 2021, will have been issued with a USI. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we will be able to do, from school through to vocational or higher education, is track the performance of students right through the system. I think this is an incredibly important initiative and it's one that the Commonwealth is also driving when it comes to the national reform initiatives. We want to make sure that progression happens to every student across primary and secondary schools, so for every year of learning they get 12 months of progression. This is something that the Commonwealth is going to drive, as well as the last thing that we've taken the key responsibility on, and that's the evidence institute.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So far we have put $12.4 million to these initiatives. But, once we've got detailed frameworks worked out, once we've agreed how all this work will be done in conjunction with state and territory government ministers, then we will look at how we will continue to expand on that investment, because this is incredibly important work. I think all of us on this side realise that the record investment that we are putting into education now has to translate into record results and outcomes. There has to be a focus on that and we're seeing that right across the board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will continue because there are so many lengthy initiatives of additional funding that we're putting into education. I want to try and get through a few more of these so every member understands what we are doing. We're also providing $2 million over three years, from 2019-20, to expand the Country Education Partnership's successful Rural Inspire program, which aims to raise the aspirations of students in rural and remote schools, develop their motivation and increase their ability to choose and achieve positive career, life and learning goals. I know the member to my left will absolutely support me in this—making sure that there is the aspiration, especially when it comes to regional and rural students, low-socioeconomic students and Indigenous students, which is absolutely key. That's why we put $2 million into this important initiative—</span>

                    </a>  Well, it is absolutely important. I would say to those members who are being a little bit cynical about this: go and meet with Country Education Partnership and see the wonderful work they are doing. What this will do is enable them to expand this incredibly important initiative nationally. The good thing about that organisation is that they didn't want some X large amount of money. They want to do it within a budget which they think is realistic and will achieve results. That is what informs our approach to education.</span>

This latest budget does nothing to rectify the inadequacies in vocational education and training—inadequacies created exclusively by this government. The proposed Skills Package of $525 million in the budget has been picked over by Senate estimates and, not surprisingly, they found that only $55.4 million is actually new money.

Yet the minister, Senator Cash, boasted in a speech on 11 July: 'Our agenda is ambitious.' Ambitious for what? The elements of the budget package, even where they have merit, will hardly make a dent in the crisis we face. Ten new regional training hubs are important as a link between school and technical education, but 10 across Australia? That is just over one per state and territory.</span>

But, Minister, what about the drop of 150,000 commencements in six years? When you step back and consider the massive cuts to this sector and the massive needs of industry over the next five years, these feeble initiatives neither prepare the damage done or address the challenges ahead. So, my question to the government is: what is the government doing to invest in schools and encourage students to undertake VET? We hear so many platitudes about the importance of technical and trade training, but the Commonwealth invests very little in creating the pathways of the future for young people. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:52</span>):  I'd like to rise to endorse the actions of the government in making sure that we look after people in regional areas. The first thing I would like to say, if I may, is there's nothing more annoying than the misleading statement that total government funding between state and federal governments is more to independent schools than it is to state schools. It's not. Total government funding between state and federal level is vastly more weighted towards state schools. They are called state schools—unsurprisingly—because they are financed by the state. And, if we didn't have federal government funding for independent schools and other schools, Catholic schools, then about 30 per cent of the student body throughout Australia would have nowhere to go. And, of course, if you think about it logically, if these people were to go to state schools and require the finance and the resources of the state, then the overall call on access to funds per student would be less. Let us always be honest because, every time you're dishonest and start making this assumption that federal government funding to state schools is less than independent schools, you should always put in the addition: but of course states finance state schools. That's why they're called state schools, not federal schools.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll tell you what I like about this. We have to make sure that we reach out to people in regional and remote areas to give them the advantage of an education. There are so many areas where not only is it unlikely that you will get tertiary education but, especially in the drought, it is also unlikely that you will get secondary education, because the only way to access secondary school facilities is to board and that is highly expensive. We need to understand that. That's why we have to make sure that all people across our nation, no matter where they live, have capacity to access university, which of course they can't do unless they get through secondary school. Tertiary education itself is such a financial burden. For many families it's like sending the kids to boarding school. The costs are immense. There are people who have to understand that they can't go to university, not because they are not capable but because they can't pay for it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what I like about this. The minister, in his diligent work in the Expenditure Review Committee and as a member of cabinet, has got $93.7 million to assist with scholarships—in fact, scholarships of $15,000 each to 4,720 people. This is so important for the people of Brewarrina, Eromanga, Birdsville, Emmaville and the towns that seem to be so often outside the remit of my colleagues on the other side of the chamber. In fact, they are very rarely mentioned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there was the ridicule of the $2 million over three years to expand country education partnerships. I commend the minister for making sure that people have a greater sense of the opportunities that lie before them. It is always this side of the political spectrum—the coalition; the government—reaching out to these people to further assist them. I acknowledge that in this drought one of the saddest things is to see kids being taken out of boarding school—whether it's in country areas, such as Tamworth and Armidale, or the capital cities—and going home. There may be a whole range of reasons given, but the real reason is that there's no money. Therefore, their education has concluded. You may say that they should go to a state school, but in many areas there's not a state school—they just don't exist—or the state school does not have the capacity to deliver the curriculum to get them to university.</span>

The other thing is that other parts of the world pay vastly less per student but get vastly greater results. Why is our standard of teaching not able to provide the results that other countries can achieve for less money?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:57</span>):  This budget is exactly what we've come to expect from an out-of-touch, out-to-lunch third-term government when it comes to education. There is no agenda and no vision on moving the country forward. Everyone in this country knows that you just can't trust this government when it comes to properly funding education—from early childhood education through to our TAFEs and universities. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today though I want to focus on the early childhood education and childcare sector. The science is settled. If we fail to invest in education, we pay for it in the long run. The earlier you start the greater the economic benefits that flow. The preschool years are critical to giving children the very best start in life. During the election campaign I was proud to campaign with Labor's policy of universal access to preschool for all three-year-old and four-year-old Australian children. Labor initiated universal access for preschools for four-year-olds and it has been a great success. With 90 per cent of a child's development occurring in the first five years of life, investment in these critical years pays dividends throughout the entirety of someone's life. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's great news for children, who will get the best start in life to ensure that they reach their full potential. It's great news for families, who will get relief from the ever-mounting costs of child care. And it's great news to have a smarter and more engaged cohort of younger Australians as we take our stake in a global knowledge economy. This is all borne out by a recent EU study that showed that, for the three years, every dollar spent on early childhood education returns $4 to the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Australia heads into a period of increased global tensions and uncertainty, it's more important than ever that we create an economic agenda that extends beyond the short term. The Treasurer frequently asserts that the economic fundamentals are strong, but this government has done nothing for six years now. How can the Treasurer believe his own rhetoric when we're faced with a downturn in terms of trade, historically low wages growth, and chronic underemployment and youth unemployment? We need to capitalise on the economic benefits of investing in education and kickstart the productivity that's missing from our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why this budget is so disappointing. One of the most disheartening measures, especially in my electorate of Newcastle, is the cynical attitude to the funding of child care for four-year-olds. I call on the minister to go back to the cabinet and fight for real funding that our early childhood educators, our parents and our children can count on. But this shouldn't come as a surprise. The Liberals just don't get the importance of education. They never have. They see education as a line item in the budget, ripe for slashing, rather than as an investment in our national prosperity. They've cut billions from schools, they've cut billions from universities and TAFE, and now they won't even guarantee preschool funding. They've also made it harder for regional and remote early learning centres to stay open. It's very interesting that the National Party stood by while the budget based services in their electorates were demolished by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a very disappointing time, especially given what we're seeing for the future of Australia's preschoolers. There was an opportunity for the government to commit to Australian preschool funding, to recognise that the two years before school are really important and to invest in them, but, as is so often the case with this lacklustre government, we have a minister who sees the portfolio only as a means to find some cuts and bide his time until he gets a portfolio he really cares about. The UK, China, New Zealand, France and Ireland have all expanded their early childhood education programs to include three-year-olds. It's time we caught up. Australian kids deserve better, Australian families deserve better, and our country deserves nothing less.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the minister: when will funding for the universal access to the early childhood education agreement expire? Will the government extend the agreement? Has the agreement for the 2020 preschool year been signed by the states and territories? I ask him to come to my electorate of Newcastle and explain to new parents and early childhood educators why their children and students don't deserve funding security, and why centres like Samaritans Early Learning Centre in Newcastle, which I visited last week, don't deserve secure funding. While he's there, he might like to explain to the families of Stockton why he's letting the Stockton Early Learning Centre literally slip into the ocean, leaving the community with zero access to early learning.</span>

We are demonstrating that through this year's budget, with a record $21.4 billion in funding for state schools, Catholic schools and independent schools for the 2020 school year—an increase in funding of $8.5 billion since 2013. There are two initiatives in this particular budget that I commend the minister on and which I wish to highlight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first of these relates to a particular passion area of mine, and that is children and education in remote areas of the country. I grew up in a town called Northam in regional Western Australia. My parents, a lawyer and a teacher, had moved there as newlyweds to find work. My mum, an English teacher, taught in the local high school, alongside many other gifted and wonderful teachers who worked in the country as part of a return-to-service program. My mum, like many others, ended up outstaying any and all requirements of the return-to-service program. She and my father ended up staying in Northam for 17 years in total. Excellent education depends on excellent teaching staff, and it depends on consistency of teachers. Turnover of teaching staff can thwart any achievements made on a year-by-year basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having worked with university students for so long, I know that there are many reasons university graduates do not think about relocating to remote areas to work—isolation, fear of the unknown and the financial impost, to name a few. But I also know that many of them fall in love with these areas when they do pursue the opportunity, and they end up becoming firmly embedded in that community. What we need to do is encourage our graduates and newly graduated teachers to put aside hesitations about moving to remote areas for work. That is what this government's initiative does, remitting the debt incurred of graduate teachers who teach for a minimum of four years in remote schools, and it is an excellent initiative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other initiative I want to highlight relates to the arts. I'm not an active contributor to the arts. I have no artistic talent whatsoever. But I'm a passionate supporter of the arts and I believe that the arts must be embedded within our education system. If we want to ensure that our young people fully engage with education, that they learn to think creatively, that they learn to see the world through different eyes, that they learn about the world in which they live, like almost nothing else the arts have the ability to challenge, to engage and to inspire.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many fantastic events and initiatives in my electorate of Curtin that offer young people the opportunity to actively engage with the arts. Indeed, I recently attended a Bell Shakespeare program in my electorate, with year 11 and year 12 girls from St Hilda's Anglican School for Girls, and it was a sensational experience. Reading Shakespeare is wonderful in and of itself, but seeing a live production can be truly transformative. Our government gets it. We get the importance of arts in education. In this budget there is a $5.7 million commitment over five years to fund the delivery of arts programs, through Music Australia and Bell Shakespeare, across Australia. It won't be the hills that are alive but it will be this vast sunburnt country of ours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I finish, I ask the education minister—and I commend him on all the work that he's done and continues to do in education—to further outline some of the initiatives being introduced by the government in this budget.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:08</span>):  I want to draw attention to what I'd call the orphan child of the minister's portfolio, which is international education, and decry the complete lack of focus in the budget—the budget papers and the budget initiatives, with the exception of two—on Australia's third-most valuable export sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">International education, on the latest figures, is worth $38 billion to this country, third only to coal and iron ore, yet it's forgotten by the government. We've seen an increase in tourism because of it, and that's a category. We've seen an increase in students. There are 630,000 students, at present, studying in Australia and over 700,000 enrolments. This covers universities, higher education providers, TAFEs, private VET and English language courses. None of those figures include the offshore benefits from our providers delivering offshore curriculum training and so on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's of enormous long-term strategic importance to this nation. Literally, over a million alumni from some of the wealthiest leadership in South-East Asia, and every part of the world, have studied and spent their formative years here. It's critical to underpinning future trade and economic relationships, and the internationalisation benefits for our curriculum and the experiences for our students, domestically, at all levels. It is disappointing, therefore, that the budget papers are almost silent. There are two small initiatives: pages 9 and 64 in Budget Paper No. 2. That's it. That's all the Parliamentary Library could find, in all that stack of papers, for Australia's third-largest export industry. The government, as you can tell from their comments, sees this sector as a cash cow—nothing more, nothing less. The minister himself, when trying to defend the capping of higher education places and the $2.2 billion cut, said, 'Well, you can go and recruit more international students.' The Prime Minister then blames international students for congestion—not his failure to invest in infrastructure. It's the fault of international students that you can't sit on the train.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our success is a wonderful thing for this country. We should treasure it. It should be a bipartisan endeavour, and I hope in the future it will remain so, in broad terms. But the government is becoming complacent. The question concerns the sustainability of growth, and there is little to nothing in this budget, except for the two admittedly worthy regional initiatives, that actually underpins the future of the sector. We have risks of a bubble. No sector should think that double-digit growth—10 per cent, 12 per cent, 12 per cent, 16 per cent—will continue. We saw this movie back in 2007. There was a whole range of reasons why we had the bubble pricked, and it was devastating to the economy and the sector. The risks are growing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Market diversification—source countries—and also market diversification and distribution between the states. What I'd call the two most important factors that underpin future sustainable growth—we have to be ruthless on these—are positive student experience and ruthless enforcement of quality. We are high cost as an international provider and we will remain so, so we have to have the highest-quality product.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing examples of workplace exploitation, which are not addressed in the budget. The budget has nothing in it to address the crisis in workplace exploitation. Also, isolation of students and overconcentration of students in many courses are ruining the experience for domestic students. The minister has claimed publicly that quality is protected by our regulators, but that is rubbish. Everyone in the sector knows it is rubbish—especially, I'd call out not the high end but the lower end of the private vocational market. The periodic ASQA reviews are not working. At the low end, those courses have become a visa factory for people who are not attending classes. We have called out before that the minimum of 20 hours of attendance at VET courses is abolished. So, you can come to a low-cost provider in this country and not attend any classes. You can do that under the current regulations. This has been a known problem, and I will say that it was the Labor government that changed that rule. It was a mistake. But you've been in government for six years. There's nothing in the budget that addresses these problems. There should be mention of it. There's no new funding for ASQA whatsoever. It's clear and it's obvious if you talk to the sector that the high-quality providers would welcome your doing something about the bottom feeders in the market. They are the ones that hang outside their colleges and take their students. They would welcome your taking their concerns seriously, but the budget is silent on these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also silent on the fact that 75 per cent of students coming to this country come through education agents. If you're a dodgy financial advisor, a dodgy real estate agent or a dodgy childcare provider, you get kicked out of the sector. There is nothing like that in international education. There is a bunch of sharks that we know keep phoenixing their businesses, ripping off students and risking the sustainability of the sector in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the minister: you really need to pay more attention. I never thought I'd say this, but it's almost like 'Bring back Richard Colbeck', because he was the world's first and only minister for international education. I think you may need some assistance to get some focus. You now have two minutes to inspire us as to how you're going to take this sector seriously and actually deal with the problems.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="210911" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Education</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:13</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Bruce for his contribution. It gives me time to address a part of our budget that I haven't addressed until this stage, and that's our record investment in higher education. I commend all members on this debate. Once again, if I could just highlight that what we've seen demonstrated by the government through this debate is our record funding across all sectors for education, and in particular higher education—over $17 billion, and the sector will continue to grow. One of the things I've been very closely working on with the sector is performance based funding. That will see a further $230 million provided to universities in 2023. That will be focused on making sure that we have employment-ready graduates. The sector has worked cooperatively with the government on this. I think it's an incredibly important initiative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say to the member for Bruce that one thing that he forgot to mention, and it's quite a sizable outcome from the budget, is the $93.7 million over four years, from 2019-20, to establish a new scholarship program, Destination Australia, to increase the number of domestic and international students studying in regional locations, to provide students with opportunities to live and study in a regional community and help share the economic and other benefits of Australia's tertiary education sector among more regional communities. It's an important initiative, because one of the things we have to do is make sure that we're spreading the economic benefit that Australia gets from international education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Bruce is right. This is an incredibly important sector to our nation. It's why it's been a key focus of the government not only in the Destination Australia program but also on what we're ensuring to do to make sure that it continues to be sustainable into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commitments that we're looking to embark on, especially in making sure that we have students coming from all round the globe, are to look at other markets to make sure we're getting the balance right. India is one of the key priority markets that we're looking at in that regard. But we do have to make sure that we are getting students from overseas and that they are going to all parts of Australia and we're seeing the benefits of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't a budget initiative, but another initiative that I worked on very closely with the minister for immigration is around work rights and extending an extra year of work rights for those who go and study in regional and rural areas. We're already seeing a benefit from that change to work rights. We will continue to push other changes which make sure that we spread that over $35 billion record that we're getting from international education right across the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to briefly mention a couple of other things in winding up. As part of the government's commitment to Closing the Gap, the government will remit higher education loan, HELP, debts for teachers in very remote areas of Australia. The member for Curtin was right to acknowledge this incredibly important program. This recognises the geographic, social, cultural and economic challenges that are unique to delivering education in such locations, as well as the much higher level of relative need. This program will make a huge difference in making sure that we're getting teachers into remote areas and that they're staying there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing that we are doing is increasing the combined HELP loan limit to $150,000 for students undertaking eligible aviation courses at a VET student loan approved provider, or a higher education provider, from 1 January 2020. This increase will improve the accessibility to courses to better support students and the commercial aviation sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And $5 million over two years, from 2018-19, will go to the University of Melbourne to commence construction of the Stawell underground physics laboratory. As the only such facility in the Southern Hemisphere, the Stawell laboratory will be part of a global research effort to try and discover what the DNA of dark matter is—an incredibly important initiative which will put us at the forefront of global research. I finish by thanking everyone for their contribution to this debate.</span>

The total appropriations for the Attorney-General's Department will now include $379.1 million over the next five years to support the work of the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also the case that a national mechanism will be created for Commonwealth legal assistance funding. In the recent budget there was the provision of an extra $114.3 million in extra funding to allow for that national mechanism to occur, which is distributed through Legal Aid and community legal centres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also the case that in the previous budget the Commonwealth Integrity Commission had been budgeted for. That has $106.7 million of new money allocated to it over the forward estimates. That figure of $106.7 million excludes the $40.7 million that is already appropriated to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. That is a very significant appropriation over the forward estimates for the new body, the Commonwealth Integrity Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the previous budget it's also the case that $38.6 million is to be provided from 2019-20 to fund additional judges for the Federal Court of Australia, including to expand its jurisdiction to include corporate misconduct, ensuring the courts can cope with the current and future case load. Obviously much of that is earmarked in anticipation of further prosecutions emanating out of the banking royal commission. It is also the case that during the 2019 federal election the government announced additional funding of $12 million over the forward estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On to other matters in my portfolio. There is $10 million going to the National Archives of Australia to digitise World War II records. In the context of the overall budget, that's a modest application, but it's an incredibly important project. It's something all Australians will benefit from, in due course. There's also $2 million in the election commitments for the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman to monitor the NDIS Participant Service Guarantee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Preventing violence against women and children is obviously a top priority for our government. Since 2013, over $840 million in new money has been invested in that area. That of course includes $328 million under the Fourth Action Plan on the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. As part of the 2018 Women's Economic Security Package, the government has provided ongoing funding initially of $7 million over three years to establish the Family Violence and Cross-examination of Parties Scheme. Under the scheme the Legal Aid commissions are being funded to legally represent parties so that victims of family violence are not subjected to cross-examination by their abuser, which was made law by legislation previously moved through this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also the case that in the 2018-20 budget there was an additional $7.8 million committed over three years for dedicated men's support workers to be engaged in all the family advocacy and service locations. Speaking with many of the judges who have been experiencing that, they see this as a very good initiative and that it is working and providing great assistance to litigants and the court. That $7.8 million builds on the previous investment and puts the men's support workers in the existing family and advocacy support services location.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I note the Morrison government is taking action to prevent vulnerable workers. On the other side of the portfolio, with respect to industrial relations, it's the case that in the previous budget we provided $10.8 million to enhance the Fair Work Ombudsman's capacity to conduct investigations and to improve migrant workers' understandings of their workplace rights. It's also the case that we have allocated $16 million to establish a National Labour Hire Registration Scheme, which was in response to the Migrant Workers' Taskforce recommendation. That work is underway. With that brief summary, I invite contribution from members.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWG" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DREYFUS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:23</span>):  Is it correct that the Morrison government hates the idea of being held accountable for its actions? I've got a few questions for the Attorney-General, which all concern the National Integrity Commission proposal that the government announced with incredible fanfare, perhaps sensing an election was coming on, in December last year. We have heard precisely nothing about this since the press conference by the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister in that December. Is it because the Morrison government hates the idea of being held accountable for its actions? Is that why the Morrison government has been slithering around on the issue of establishing a National Integrity Commission, trying to avoid any real commitments despite having said in December last year that they had been working on this since January of last year? That's a pretty extraordinary proposition given that 20 months have now lapsed since January of last year, when the government said it started working on this, and, perhaps one could add, despite public comments on the proposal that the government put forward in December, closing on 1 February of this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For years we heard from this Attorney-General that he saw no persuasive evidence that a National Integrity Commission was needed. Then he changed his tune and said that he was open-minded on the subject. But that doesn't quite square with the Prime Minister having called the National Integrity Commission a 'fringe issue' late last year—in fact, almost up to when he stood up with the Attorney-General and announced on 13 December that a National Integrity Commission was needed after all. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Attorney-General answers, or tries to answer, some of these questions, he might also like to answer this question: Why did the proposal that the government put forward in December last year amount to a sham of an integrity commission? That's not my description; that's a description that's been provided by a number of commentators—people who have studied, worked and provided legal advice on this subject for years. They think what the government put forward in December last year is a sham. It's a sham, of course, that it was only proposed by the Morrison government after they were dragged kicking and screaming to support a National Integrity Commission. They can't, of course, bring themselves to call it a National Integrity Commission because that's Labor's name, and it would never do for this government to adopt anything that the Labor Party had suggested.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has to wake up to reality on this subject. The Australian people want a National Integrity Commission. Absolutely, our country will benefit from having one, and when the Morrison government eventually gets around to legislating on this subject—there's no sign of it at the moment, because the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, in its legislation listed to be introduced in this parliament through to the end of 2019, has not listed the National Integrity Commission as the subject of legislation—it needs to understand that the Australian people want a real National Integrity Commission, a commission which has the independence, powers and resources that are needed to stamp out corruption and serious misconduct in government and in the federal public sector. The Australian public want a watchdog with real teeth rather than some kind of obedient lapdog of the government, which seems to be what Mr Morrison and his team want.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sorry fact is that trust in politics and politicians is at historic lows. It's made worse every day by the chaos and cover-ups that have become the hallmark of this government. What is the government doing about that? Why is it that the Morrison government is pretending—as it does on so many issues of vital importance to this nation, from the economy to climate change and the ever-rising cost of living—that there's no problem to deal with and that a slogan will do in place of a policy? Perhaps when the Attorney-General is answering some questions about when we're actually going to get, in some kind of form, a concrete proposal for a National Integrity Commission, he'll be able to explain how the National Integrity Commission might be able to help in dealing with some examples of questionable conduct, such as the au pair controversy involving the Minister for Home Affairs, the recent Crown Casino allegations or the Paladin and Canstruct contracts, both of which were issued by the Department of Home Affairs in closed tender arrangements. While he's explaining, he might also explain how his model in any way satisfies the demands that have been made for a real integrity commission.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282986" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALLEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:29</span>):  I wish to take the opportunity to ask the Attorney-General what the Morrison government is doing to assist women and their children who are facing, or who may be at risk of finding themselves in, domestic violence situations. As a doctor, I have seen the damage caused to victims and their families by this violence. The extended health effects are devastating and often persist long after the violence ceases. However, my experience also leads me to strongly believe in the powerful effects of early intervention and treatment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last 10 years our knowledge about family violence, and in particular violence and abuse against women and their children, has increased. Our society has come to understand that abuse is not always physical and that emotional and financial abuse is just as prevalent. We now understand that abuse is a complex issue that requires a coordinated response from government agencies and the community. That is why we need integrated legal and social support assistance for women and their children when faced with a domestic violence situation. Often women do not have the resources to navigate the legal processes themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have four interrelated questions for the Attorney-General. Firstly, can the Attorney-General please outline what measures the government is taking to provide legal support for women and their children, including how the 2018 Women's Economic Security Package, delivered by the government, will directly impact women who are experiencing family violence? The former member for Higgins, Kelly O'Dwyer, as Minister for Women, was instrumental in ensuring the National Action Plan, and keeping women and children safe remains one of the Morrison government's top priorities. As the current member for Higgins, I'm pleased to stand in this place and take up the mantle and build on her good work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Fourth Action Plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children has seen the government invest $328 million in real and tangible initiatives to address violence against women and children. We know that domestic violence can be a vicious cycle, that it can be intergenerational and that those who offend have often been offended against. To fully eradicate violence against women and their children and, indeed, violence against men, we must stop the cycle and provide a holistic approach to family violence that treats the whole family unit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, can the Attorney-General please outline what programs the Morrison government is implementing to prevent the occurrence of domestic violence? It is also vitally important we have a coordinated response when dealing with specific domestic violence situations. For too long, offenders and perpetrators have been able to fly under the radar due to a lack of information-sharing between states and territories, courts and agendas. We must work towards a technological solution to provide real-time information to all involved parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, can the Attorney-General tell us how the $11 million provided under the Fourth Action Plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children will be used to provide a prompt and coordinated response to family safety? Unfortunately, it is often women and their children who fall victim to this surge in family violence. Currently, in Australia, every two minutes, police are called to a domestic and family violence matter. Every day 12 women are hospitalised due to domestic and family violence. Every nine days a woman is killed by a current or former partner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourthly, it is with this heartbreaking knowledge that I ask the Attorney-General to outline how the government is working to eradicate domestic violence, particularly through family advocacy and support services, enhanced information-sharing and changes to cross-examination. Thank you.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:33</span>):  In my electorate of Gilmore on the South Coast of New South Wales, we have a youth unemployment rate of 18.7 per cent. That is the highest rate in New South Wales and the third-highest in the country. Under this government, we have the lowest workforce participation rate in Australia at just 47 per cent. Our numbers of part-time workers are above the national average and the number of full-time workers is below it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The median weekly income for people is just $535 a week. I am always hearing from members of my community who tell me how they are struggling with bills, with food, with medical bills—people who have all but given up. But this government is not doing anything to address this. When the government voted to slash Sunday and public holiday penalty rates in 2017, hitting the back pockets of 11,934 people in Gilmore, my predecessor Ann Sudmalis, told young people it was a gift. She told young people who were losing out that the cuts to penalty rates wouldn't cut wages but, rather, would open the door to more jobs. She told those in my electorate who were struggling to pay their bills and giving up time with their families on a Sunday that the cut to their penalty rates was 'a gift for our young people to get a foot in the door of employment'. This is what this government has been saying, but we know now that this has been no gift.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After that first cut came a second, in July 2018, for those in the retail and hospitality industries. We were told that that would lead to an expansion in employment. We were told it would mean new jobs and longer hours for those people who were underemployed. Two years on, the Australia Institute has found that employment growth in retail and hospitality has been far slower than in other parts of the economy where penalty rates remain constant. It found that job growth in these two sectors actually slowed by more than half after penalty rates began to fall. That is some gift!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Australia Institute, all of the new jobs created in the retail and broad hospitality sector were part-time. In fact, both sectors reduced the amount of full-time work after this government's penalty rate cuts. At a time when the people of the South Coast are struggling—with wage growth stagnating, with the rate of Newstart so low that the cost of looking for work is higher, with rampant wage theft and with a stagnant economy—we are seeing job creation in these two sectors deteriorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even the Reserve Bank has been trying to tell this government that we need increased wages. Only last month Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe said that we need to increase public and private sector wages. We need higher wages, not lower wages, to encourage increased consumer spending to stimulate the economy and to help our local shops. Instead, the government want to make more cuts. This time they are attacking the lowest-paid tradies in the country—hairstylists. This will mean a $90.80 per week loss for many of the 332 hairstylists in Gilmore. This is a cut they simply cannot afford. Many local people in my electorate have no choice but to go to work on public holidays and weekends. They have to so that they can put food on the table and pay their bills. They deserve their penalty rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the recent election Labor wanted to reverse those cuts. We wanted to invest in workers and support them to look for and keep work. I'm committed to make sure that my local community have the support that they need. I have been listening to their stories of hardship and struggle. I call on this government to do more to improve the conditions for Australian workers. Workers desperately need a wage increase to kickstart the economy. This government needs to develop a comprehensive plan to boost wages and improve job security, and it should start by restoring penalty rates. The government needs to stop this latest attack on hairdressers. It needs to stand up for workers across Australia. I will always stand up for workers on the South Coast.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is nothing in the budget that will address these issues and help the people of the South Coast who are struggling. There is nothing to address wage theft and there is nothing to address wage growth. I ask the Attorney-General: what are you doing to address these issues? What will you do to lift the workforce participation rate for people in Batemans Bay? How do you plan to address the youth unemployment rate in Nowra? What will you do to make sure that people in Moruya can get a job? We need a plan now.</span>

In this contribution I will focus on the Integrity Commission, but I note for the member for Gilmore that, of course, it was the case that the decision with respect to penalty rates was made by the independent Fair Work Commission, which was established by Labor, according to all the rules of engagement and consideration. That was not a decision of the government; that was a decision of a body created by your side of politics.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the anticorruption body, I am becoming very aware of the member for Isaacs's views. There is a range of different models that you could determine upon. There's great detail that needs to be determined in each of those broad models. I understand the member for Isaacs's views. In fact, they are eerily similar to those echoed in an article by Nick O'Malley recounting some statements made by Stephen Charles as a former judge from Victoria. Stephen Charles said: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That does sound very conspiratorial. The headline for that article was: 'Coalition's anti-corruption body "a sham", retired judge says'. This article is eerily similar to the submissions made by the shadow Attorney-General today.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was interesting to note before the election that there were some sage remarks from the President of the Law Council about that statement from Stephen Charles, the retired Victorian judge. The President of the Law Council of Australia, Arthur Moses, felt strongly enough to issue a statement about those words used by Stephen Charles. He said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I don't think it is appropriate or correct to refer to the model proposed by Attorney-General Porter of a national integrity commission as fraudulent or designed to avoid scrutiny of ministers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I hope and expect any debate after the election on this important step to combat corruption, no matter who is in power, will be conducted respectfully with the rule of law at the front of the mind of everyone.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that is exceptionally good advice. The shadow Attorney-General and I will have a great deal of work to do together over the coming months on this body—work which will go out in a full legislative draft for public consultation, which no doubt then will go to committee. It will be a very complicated and long piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was some rhetoric. I will answer the rhetoric as best I can. Have we determined upon the particular model that was set out in our December 2018 discussion paper entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">A Commonwealth integrity commission—proposed reforms</span> because we hate the idea of accountability? Not unsurprisingly, you will figure the answer to that is no. Having watched and learnt from the particular shortcomings that have clearly been exhibited in state bodies of this type, we've determined upon the particular model that was set out in considerable detail in that paper in December 2018 because we think, firstly, that represents the best parts of the state models and drops off the worst parts and, secondly, the Commonwealth integrity environment is very different from and, dare I say it, far more complicated than the state integrity environment. Looking at the Greens' bill that was put through the Senate in the last few days, and the Independent bill from the former member for Indi that was put into parliament in the previous parliament, which are very, very similar—in fact, almost identical in every serious material respect—one of the difficulties with those models, among many others, is that they fail to take into account any consideration or propose proper rules as to how that new body would interact with the very complicated environment that we're in where there are a number of existing bodies. How do you avoid duplication, overlap and wasting of resources? How would these things work in terms of each other's jurisdiction?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:43</span>):  When it comes to industrial relations and helping workers, this government is all talk and no action. We live at a time of great uncertainty for the workforce. With five per cent unemployment and another eight per cent underemployed, almost one in six Australian workers is actually poor. For those in work, insecurity is at an all-time high. More than 40 per cent of the workforce is in casual, contract or gig-economy style work. We now have many people working multiple jobs. Tragically, 16 per cent of Australians now have to work three or more jobs just to make ends meet. Worse still, sham contracting is rife. We all know the example of the cleaner employed to clean floors of a multistorey building one day and then forced to become an independent contractor to clean the same floors the next. They have the same job, the same hours, the same employer, but now they have less pay and have to assume the costs of running their own business. It's a sham. And the law ought to change to ensure that it is seen as such. Like the wolf in sheep's clothing, this government cosies up to workers, saying, 'I'm here to help.' But the reality is they do nothing to change the law to make work more permanent, or to give casuals the right to convert to permanent work after six months, or to end sham contracting. All they ever do is undermine the existing supports that workers have. The two supports for workers' rights are strong laws, and rigorous enforcement, and their trade unions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On both counts, this government is missing in action. Apart from union action to recover wages, it is the Fair Work Ombudsman that is the main point of advice, guidance and prosecution in the system. Yet the first action of an incoming Liberal government in 2013 was to slash the Commonwealth contributions to the Fair Work Ombudsman's budget by more than 10 per cent. Since then, revelations of wage theft have become widespread. From 7-Eleven to famous restaurateurs, our papers are filled daily with examples of employer abuse. The Fair Work Ombudsman prosecutes some of the most egregious cases, but these are very few in number and usually because United Voice or another union has gained media exposure. Usually, there are repayment agreements and consent orders, but businesses are not prosecuted. No wonder wage theft continues unabated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just like the financial sector, light-touch regulation has failed our workers. The plethora of media cases seems to have finally had an impact on the government. In July, the Prime Minister said in question time that the Attorney-General was drafting laws to deal with criminalising worker exploitation. But where are those laws? And where are the additional resources that would be needed to lodge more civil cases against employers and to prepare for criminal cases should the government ever get around to putting the promised laws to parliament?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This 2019-20 budget shows a miserly increase in resources for the Fair Work Ombudsman. Where are the additional resources for workplace inspections? Where are the additional facilities to assist workers at the doors of the small claims court? On the other hand, this government continues to pour resources into the Australian Building and Construction Commission—more than $77 million for a punitive watchdog in an industry employing just eight per cent of the national workforce and less than three per cent of commercial building. The ABCC doesn't give a flying toss about underpayment of workers or subbies or not being paid by principal contractors, or occupational health and safety issues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Compare the ABCC budget to the total $184 million Commonwealth contribution towards the Fair Work Ombudsman and the Registered Organisations Commission for 2019 and 2020. The ombudsman looks after the interests of all workers across all industries but especially the most vulnerable workers, young workers, those on visas and from non-English-speaking backgrounds, who we know are ruthlessly exploited, those in hospitality and retail and those in the regions. Yet this government refuses to properly resource the Fair Work Ombudsman. The Fair Work Commission budget has increased by less than inflation. The budget will be stretched to breaking point, with the appointment late last year of six of the government's employer mates as deputy presidents at $460,000 each year. Those six appointments cost $3 million. They were totally unnecessary. It was simply a government, thinking they would lose the election, trying to desperately stack the commission. The $3 million would have gone a long way to helping employ inspectors or giving a lot more information to workers. Instead, we got the government's political mates stacked into the commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My question is: when will the government properly resource the Fair Work Ombudsman, and when will they start funding the real needs of workers, who are being exploited in their thousands, rather than the punitive watchdogs like the ROC and the ABCC?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:48</span>):  I would like to take this opportunity to raise a number of issues with the Attorney-General regarding fraud and corruption against the Commonwealth and, in particular, how the government is planning on strengthening how we prevent, detect and combat both corruption and fraud. The people of Australia rightly expect that our government and all of its agencies act in good faith, act with transparency and act with complete integrity. I believe that the vast majority of people working in and for the government act in accordance with these rightful expectations and requirements. At the same time, we also know that there will always be some who do not act with integrity. There will always be some people who look to exploit the system for their own benefit. We don't know the size or the scale of the fraud against the Commonwealth, but we do know that fraud has serious consequences. It negatively impacts upon public resources—money and resources that should be directed to our essential services in health, education and infrastructure. It impacts upon the integrity of government and its capacity to do things efficiently and effectively and it impacts upon people's trust in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We here in parliament, as servants of the people, must take steps to combat fraud against the government. After all, this is fraud against all of us and all of those whom we represent. At the same time, we must ensure that our steps are appropriate and balanced. We do not want innocent, decent and good people to get caught up in frivolous, vexatious actions or allegations. Nor do we want to unnecessarily interfere with the efficient and effective operating of government and its agencies. I know that this is a matter of grave concern and serious interest to the Attorney-General. I also know it's a matter of grave concern to our government, and it is being addressed in this budget. In relation to fraud, I note that we are committing $14.4 million over two years to set up a pilot program with a number of initiatives to holistically combat fraud. The pilot program includes initiatives like the establishment of a Commonwealth fraud prevention centre and the strengthening of whole-of-government efforts to detect, disrupt and respond to serious and complex fraud by providing the AFP with significant additional funding to establish a multiagency fraud task force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Attorney, I was going to ask you about the Commonwealth Integrity Commission but I note that you have already spoken on that today. What I would say with respect to the Commonwealth Integrity Commission is that I commend you and the government on the approach taken. As you pointed out, and as those of us in Western Australia and several other states know, when these bodies are not set up properly they can be very, very dangerous. We must stamp out corruption and we need to establish a body that stamps out corruption, but we must make sure that such a body doesn't end up as a foot on the throats of innocent people, slowly and often publicly choking them to death. Attorney, given our government's commitment to ensuring integrity and encouraging public confidence in our government and its agencies, I ask you—through you, Mr Deputy Speaker Gillespie—to outline how the government is strengthening our current multifaceted approach to combating corruption and providing the funds necessary to enhance national integrity arrangements across the federal public sector.</span>

This is a matter that the Attorney-General has spoken about, and I'd start by asking him: why did the Australian Federal Police, on consecutive days, raid the home of a News Corp journalist and the Sydney office of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has repeatedly claimed that it respects press freedom and that it wants to protect journalists. The government has claimed that it understands the vital role that the media plays in the health of our democracy. But those words ring hollow in the face of those raids having been conducted. The words ring hollow in the face of the statements that have been made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs, who's the minister now responsible for the Australian Federal Police, in the weeks and months since those raids took place. They say things like 'nobody is above the law'. That's one of the favourite statements of the Minister for Home Affairs, and similar statements have come from the Prime Minister. But I'd ask the Attorney-General whether he agrees with the proposition that the police should not be raiding journalists just because they are doing their job. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can the Attorney-General confirm, while he's answering these questions about press freedom, that the Federal Police raids were carried out in response to possible breaches of section 79 of the Crimes Act? Can the Attorney-General confirm that before these raids being conducted in June 2019 no journalist or media organisation had ever been prosecuted under section 79? Can the Attorney-General perhaps explain why he, alone, in the 104-year history of this law thinks it's appropriate to use the criminal law, specifically section 79 of the Crimes Act, to target journalists for doing their jobs? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Jonathan Holmes, a former <span style="font-style:italic;">Media Watch</span> broadcaster, writing in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> just last month on 27 August drew attention to these questions, and they're questions that need to be answered. It might be that the Attorney-General has said that he would be—his words—'seriously disinclined' to authorise the prosecution of journalists just for doing their jobs. Well, he needs to answer the question of why these raids went ahead in the first place, and how it is that the Commonwealth government, apparently for the first time ever, is not just using section 79 but now is having searches conducted with warrants that alleged that the journalists concerned might in fact be charged with the offence of theft—something which has never been considered before. But it might mean that in future, any journalist who receives any information that's not authorised from a Commonwealth officer—whether it's harmful or not, it might be completely innocuous, whether it's already been published or been binned—risks, apparently, prosecution for stolen property with a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. The chilling effect, the intimidatory effect on journalists, on the media, in this country can only be contemplated. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Does the Attorney-General agree that a strong and independent media is vital to holding governments to account? And, if so, what plans does the Attorney-General—and anyone in this government—have to strengthen press freedom and ensure that there is no repeat of the raids we saw in June? It is a matter for the government. It's not a matter which the government can simply wash its hands of and say, 'Oh, that's a matter for the police.' It's the government which, as, in effect, the complainant, determines that a referral takes place. It's the government which is complaining about the matter of particular leaks, because this government's very selective—they don't care about some leaks when it suits their cause, but they care about other leaks when they are embarrassed by them—and it's this government that is ultimately responsible for the way in which the media in this country are being treated. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can the Attorney-General confirm that as of this minute there is still a prospect that Annika Smethurst and journalists at the ABC could be prosecuted or even go to jail? An official told us that this was still the case at a hearing of the intelligence committee last month. Can the Attorney-General rule that out as well? Can he show some concern about media freedom?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General, Minister for Industrial Relations and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:58</span>):  The shadow Attorney-General just complained about a form of words that has been used that journalists are not above the law, which is very strange to complain about on a day where the shadow Attorney-General said this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Literally today the shadow Attorney-General said the same thing that he's complaining about here. It's absolutely remarkable! You might forgive one's memory for being short over the course of a week, but not an afternoon! It's just absolutely remarkable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Heading back to these memory lapses, amongst earlier questions with respect to the Commonwealth Integrity Commission like 'Does it amount to a sham?' and 'Do we hate the idea of accountability?' was this scholarly question: 'Why would you call it the Commonwealth Integrity Commission and not the national integrity commission?' That is a hard-hitting question, isn't it? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He answered his own question by saying, 'Because Labor came up with the name "National Integrity Commission"'. It's like the Monty Python skit with the Judean People's Front and the People's Front of Judea. It is just absurd. Then the shadow Attorney-General asked me why I had changed my view on an integrity commission—something I've never done. I've always said I have an open mind to it. It would have to be designed properly, but I have never changed my view. The shadow Attorney-General, when asked specifically about the need for a National Integrity Commission in 2013, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I'm not convinced that there is a need for yet another integrity officer …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not the one who's changed views here. The Integrity Commission simply needs to be designed correctly, properly and cautiously, which is what's going to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next question the shadow Attorney-General asked was: 'When is it going to happen?' Labor proposed that, if they came into government, they'd take 12 months of consultation before they even had a draft. I can inform the shadow Attorney-General that, since announcing our commitments and a detailed model in December 2018, the drafting is going very well. It's been noted in the course of my consultations around the religious discrimination bill, which is about 50 pages, that that is a complicated exercise. The preliminary draft that I'm working on for the Commonwealth Integrity Commission is in excess of 300 pages. This is an immensely complicated set of circumstances, particularly in trying to ensure that the new body, the Commonwealth Integrity Commission, which would have two halves to it—one being the law enforcement integrity half and the other being the public sector integrity half—fits in to the very layered framework that already exists between the Australian Federal Police, the Ombudsman, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the Inspector-General of Taxation, the parliamentary committees, the Australian Public Service Commission and the Parliamentary Service Commission. All of these bodies need to be part of the overall design so that you have the proper system of referrals. These could have been questions that could have been put today and dealt with in a sensible manner, but, instead, we get the question, 'Why have you changed your view?' which isn't correct. As to the question of when, I expect that we will have a full draft out for public consultation in the not-too-distant future. I'd expect that that would be before the end of the year. I'd expect that consultations on a 300-page draft will take some time, as will the committee process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are probably few organisations more important in the recent history of the Commonwealth to get right than this one. For a person who's been involved in justice for as long as the shadow Attorney-General has, it surprises me that he has so little eye at the moment to some of the awful things that have happened at a state level under these bodies. I mean, innocent peoples' lives and careers were destroyed by the overreach of executive power. It seems to be precisely the same thing that you seem to be concerned about in the context of AFP raids. My answer to you on those is that it is of course my role, as Attorney-General, to stay completely out of the AFP's investigations, which are their own. So, when you ask me questions like, 'Why did they do it?' it is asking for me to intercede in some kind of evidentiary assessment on the judgement of the Australian Federal Police commissioner, which is precisely the thing that I'm stopped from doing in the proper conduct of my role. It's absurd grandstanding, and we all know it is. Getting this Commonwealth Integrity Commission right is very, very important. Making rhetorical statements about some lack of care is ridiculous. We will do it properly. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The skills package, which is delivering for skills for today and tomorrow, is one of the most important packages that the Morrison government is putting in place and implementing. The $525 million skills package that was announced in this year's budget is integral to the government's jobs agenda and will be essential to delivering an additional 1.25 million jobs over the next five years. The government's skills package will ensure Australians have the right skills to get a job and build a career. The skills package is an important starting point for the systemic reform identified in the Joyce review. It puts in place a number of the building blocks that are needed for a student-centric, agile, targeted and responsive system and it lays the foundation for longer term reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some important aspects to this skills and training measure: the National Careers Institute and the National Careers Ambassador. It is essential that Australians have the information they need to make informed choices about the opportunities that VET can provide for initial training, upskilling and reskilling. The Australian government will invest $42.4 million on the new National Careers Institute and National Careers Ambassador, to work with industry, government, schools and tertiary providers to improve access to and the quality of information. The institute will improve access to information and drive up the quality and coverage of career guidance nationally. The ambassador will work with key people in the community—parents, students and career advisors—to ensure young Australians have the information they need to make informed choices about their study and future careers. This includes streamlining career information by providing a one-stop shop career portal, overseeing partnership grants and raising the profile of VET.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also a competitive grants program. As part of its National Careers Institute investment, the Australian government will set up a four-year $10 million competitive grants program to boost innovative partnerships between schools, tertiary providers, industry and employers. Grants of up to $350,000 per year will be available to create innovative career advice and attraction strategies for education and training pathways aligned to the needs of employers. For example, the grants might provide funding to bring together career services, employment service providers, schools, tertiary education providers and local government in order to engage people with apprentice and traineeship opportunities that meet the needs of local regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also the Foundation Skills for Your Future program for language, literacy, numeracy and digital literacy skills. The government is investing $62.4 million in both a new program—$52.5 million—and for remote community pilots—$9.9 million—to help Australians with low-level language, literacy, numeracy and digital literacy skills to acquire the necessary skills to improve their participation in further training and employment. This is something that the government wants to focus on across the board in both the education and the training portfolios, to make sure that all students have those foundation literacy and numeracy skills—the foundation skills are just so important—whether they're going into vocational or higher education. It is absolutely vital. Approximately three million working-age Australians have low literacy or numeracy skills, or both, and are at high risk of poor employment outcomes, including being unable to upskill or reskill for new roles, and of disengaging from the labour market. At the same time, many workers have insufficient digital literacy skills for the current and future labour markets. This investment recognises that foundation skills, like language, literacy, numeracy and digital skills, are essential for people to obtain and retain secure employment and undertake further education and training. In my concluding remarks, I'll continue speaking on a lot of the other measures that the government has in the budget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gorton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>):  This government has no plans to grow wages and strengthen the economy. That's why they try to attack jobseekers—in a very offensive manner, I might add—and ignore structural issues in the labour market. One of the most pressing issues evident in the make-up of the labour market is the structural issue of underemployment and insecure work. This is really affecting our sluggish wage growth. We know that job security is becoming less and less likely for those entering the labour market. We know that wage growth is at an historic low. We know that there's no policy prescription by the government to attend to these structural problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Underemployment is a real issue. Whether it's the ABS statistics or the NAB survey, wherever you look all of the evidence points to the fact that underemployment is a major problem for our economy. If the government can't see that one of the reasons low wage growth persists is the enormous slack in our labour market due to the fact that underemployment is at about 8.4 per cent and that underutilisation, therefore, is at nearly 14 per cent, then, clearly, they can't prescribe a policy solution because they don't understand the problem. Either it's ignorance or it's incompetence from this government in relation to employment, but there is a real challenge. As I say, we have record low wage growth and high underemployment. In fact, it is the highest underemployment statistic we've seen for at least 30 or more years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some other statistics that I think the minister should consider on behalf of the minister whom he represents in this place today. According to last year's figures, a woman who was working four or more jobs was $800 a year worse off than she was the year before. And people under the age of 30 were the most likely to hold more than one job, with one in four people aged under 30 working multiple jobs. Having more than one job is not a problem, but this is also a symptom of the fact that people can't find secure work with minimum hours, whether it's full-time work or permanent part-time work with some minimum hours. Of course, this comes on top of the fact that, at about 12 per cent, the youth unemployment rate is double the national unemployment average.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see instead of policy solutions is the current government launching attack after attack upon unemployed Australians. Publicly shaming people with new media stories week after week is not helping them get into work. The ABS labour force data shows the government's abysmal track record on getting people off Newstart and into work. According to the ABS, the typical job seeker search time and long-term unemployed search time have risen since the election of this government more than six years ago. For every one job vacancy, there are three unemployed people. So, when Senator Cash decides to attack the most vulnerable in our society, calling them dole bludgers, the fact is, of course, that there are far fewer job vacancies than there are job seekers, yet that's not acknowledged at all by the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The typical job search time in Australia is nearly four months, being 15.6 weeks. This length of time has been increasing and is, on average, almost a month longer than was the case in 2013. The average search time for the long-term unemployed is also rising, yet there are very few programs that they commence in the labour market program space that succeed. For example, recent reports show that the Seasonal Work Incentives Trial has failed, helping only 404 Australians despite having a cap of 7,600. Ministers Cash's response is to blame those looking for work, saying, 'What the findings show is that there are jobs out there for those who want them.' Minister McCormack says that people should just go to regional Australia. Well, the fact is that there are not enough jobs for people who are in dire need of work, and it's no good demonising job seekers if you're seeking to support them. The questions we need to ask really are: why is there so little done by this government to attend to wage growth; why are there so few effective programs to ensure people are being connected to the labour market; why is it the case that the government seeks to attack workers in this way?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also got the government refusing to release the Targeted Compliance Framework data. This government hates transparency. Since the framework legislative and administrative arrangements came into effect in July last year, no data has been released. This type of data used to be released quarterly. My question to the minister is: when will the government release the Targeted Compliance Framework data?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="188315" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:14</span>):  It's always a great pleasure to rise in this chamber and speak about the terrific job that our small and medium businesses do across my electorate of Forde. That's why this portfolio is so important. It's about employment, skills, and small and family businesses. If we don't have small and family businesses, we don't have employment. This is why the policy the minister touched on in his opening remarks is incredibly important. In commencing this speech I want to reflect that I have some 17,000 small and medium businesses across the electorate of Forde. In addition to that, across the electorate we have had nearly 40,000 students enrolled in a variety of VET courses, some 2,600 apprentices and a range of registered training organisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to see small and family businesses grow and prosper. It is through small and family businesses growing and prospering, and our encouraging them to employ more Australians, that we can deal with the unemployment issues that we know exist in the economy. We know that there are people who want more work and we know that there are people who are unemployed and are looking to get back into the workforce. If we look at some of the things that this government has done over the past couple of years to encourage small and family businesses to grow, we have a really good story to tell. There is the increase in the instant asset write-off from the initial $20,000 to $30,000, up to a turnover of $50 million. I can remember having Minister Cash at one of my local engineering firms when we first talked about increasing it to $25,000. They were talking about the fact that that would allow them to buy a new van, to write that van off and to continue to build their business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other great thing about that visit to that business was that they had apprentices. A young apprentice told a great story about how he struggled at school, but, once he got the opportunity to pursue an apprenticeship in something he enjoyed doing, it was that much more enjoyable. He was also, importantly, able to continue and finish his schooling. There are many of those stories in my electorate of Forde.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the instant asset write-off, we've cut taxes for small and medium businesses, and there's more to come. Through our procurement policies we ensure that big businesses meet our time frames and deliver payment in just 20 days. We all know that one of the keys for small and family businesses is cash flow. The important bit of their cash flow is that they get paid on time. I've spoken to plenty of small businesses around my electorate. Big businesses, which have enormous amounts of capital and very deep pockets, use the small business community as a bank and they stretch their payment times out to 60, 90 and 120 days. That is just not sustainable for our small business community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One aspect of small business that I don't think is readily recognised is the importance of access to finance. In that regard we've set up the Australian Business Securitisation Fund, which will help small and medium businesses have better access to finance. That access to finance is going to allow them to grow and develop as well. Hopefully too it will reduce the cost of finance for those small and medium businesses. They typically face the hurdle of paying higher rates for finance. They need access to capital to grow their businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, what allows a business to grow is having a workforce that is skilled. That is what is so important about this policy. We are seeking to build and grow a skilled workforce that can be employed by our small and family business operators to create the products to export or to sell into our local market that will create economic activity. I'd like the minister to elaborate on how this will help small and medium businesses in my electorate of Forde.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  You would think, listening to the rhetoric that we've been hearing from the government, that they are the party of small business, but what we find is that their policies in no way actually reflect that. In fact, when we look at it, the Liberal Party, this government, are really just the party of big business. One of the great examples I can point to straightaway—and I do thank the member for Forde for drawing this to the Chamber's attention—is the importance of finance as the lifeblood of small business. Finance is critically important, but what is the track record of this government? The track record of this government was running a protection racket for the big banks, who were in no way helping small business to grow, to get ahead or to get access to finance in the first place. Let's dive further into what's actually happening for small business under this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the consequences of the anaemic wage growth that we're seeing under this government is that there's no money flowing into the small businesses around Australia. What they need is for Australians to be in a position to actually spend. That will be the key driver for growth in small business in Australia. But, no, they can't, because Australians' incomes are being strangled by the way in which the government is running the economy. When it comes to the critical thing that will enable small business to grow and thrive in Australia, it is the old Clinton adage: 'It's the economy, stupid.' This government is killing it. But there are a few other issues we need to address.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at small business, as it comes under this portfolio, there is a big glaring problem. It's the jobactive system. The purpose of jobactive is not only to be able to get people into jobs—and I can tell you right now that we need to help Australians get into work, especially in my electorate of Burt—it's for small businesses who want to grow to be able to find those people to put into their businesses. Jobactive is failing on both fronts. It's failing to get people into work and it's failing to provide the small businesses that want to grow with the workforce that they could use to grow. When you look at the name of this department and this portfolio you would think if there was one thing they would be doing it would be helping people get into employment through small business, but, critically, this is where we are seeing this government fail. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since taking on the role of shadow minister assisting for small and family business, I've had the pleasure of being able to work with the shadow minister for small and family business in holding a number of listening tour events around the country, listening to small and family businesses about what they want government to do, what they think would make a critical difference for them, because we understand that it's important to listen. And that's what we have been doing. I've been to the Central Coast of New South Wales. I've been to Melbourne. I know the shadow minister has been down to Hobart and up to Darwin. We're going to continue to move around and listen to small business. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things they have been raising with us frequently, and an area where they struggle sometimes, is their capacity around business administration and how it would be helpful for them to have greater assistance and guidance, either in setting up a business or continuing to meet the administrative burdens of running a business. It is interesting how these small businesses have struggled to find good information. In fact, we've also heard accountants who support these small businesses saying, 'We find it odd that some people are starting these businesses without getting the proper advice first, and no-one seems to have pointed out these problems to them beforehand.' People are telling us they want better information and better guidance. There are a number of different ways in which this could happen, but they're not seeing it on the ground. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even the small business ombudsman has pointed out, in respect of franchisees, that it's vitally important that potential franchisees know what they're getting into before signing off on the agreement. While that's about franchisees, it reflects something that is happening across small business. When we look at the budget papers, outcome 2, small business support, talks about providing these sort of supports. This is what the government says it should be doing, but clearly it's not. I met people who didn't even know business.gov.au existed. How on earth are they going to be able to access the meagre services the government's providing if the government's not even telling them where to find this information? Critically, I ask the minister representing the portfolio minister: what is government going to do? What is government going to do to make sure that not only does it help small business but it helps them find out how they can actually be helped and meets what it says it's going to do in its own budget?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:24</span>):  In my electorate of Moncrieff we currently have just under 32,000 small businesses. They are the lifeblood of our local economy and the backbone of the Gold Coast, creating thousands of jobs in industries such as tourism, manufacturing and hospitality. I am pleased to see the government's investment to support small business and job creation in this budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the minister is passionate about small business, and I congratulate her on the job she's doing. Senator Cash visited my electorate and saw firsthand the huge amount of business activity in Moncrieff, including My Centre Nerang, where Michele and Peter Ivanovsky own a Luv a Coffee cafe. Like many small business owners in my electorate, they work dedicated long hours and are committed to supporting the community through the services and products they provide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Michele and Peter are just one example of thousands of small business owners in Moncrieff who can now benefit from the extension of the instant asset write-off. My local bar and restaurant owners, hairdressers, butchers, nail technicians, paint shops, dress shops, music shops, car washes, gymnasiums and many, many more small business—I could go on and on—will now benefit from this initiative. If they wish to update their coffee machine or purchase a new fridge or even a small car, they can invest that $30,000 and instantly claim it as a tax deduction. As I learned when I was in small business, $30,000 is a significant amount and helps with the overall cost of running any business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During her visit last month Minister Cash and I visited the Metcash Expo at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre in Broadbeach, where we heard many terrific stories from successful family owned businesses in retail, in manufacturing and in franchising. They were all grateful that we have a Morrison government that is providing stability and certainty for their future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also met with nearly 100 small business leaders and owners at a luncheon, where we all had the opportunity to celebrate the success of our local entrepreneurs. It was also a chance for them to raise their concerns. One such concern was access to finance, as was outlined by the member for Forde. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is listening to small business owners and is responding directly to their concerns. This is in stark contrast to those opposite. They have ignored small business for so long now that, after losing the last election, they had to go on a 'listening tour' that wasted thousands of taxpayer dollars on a fact-finding mission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government understand small business. We get it. We are the natural party of small business—always have been and always will be. This is why we are helping small business owners with tax breaks so they can keep more of their money to invest in and grow their business. The tax rate for those businesses with a turnover of less than $50 million has been reduced from 30 per cent to 27.5 per cent—the lowest rate in 50 years. The Morrison government will be further reducing this to 25 per cent. These changes are going to benefit nearly 32,000 businesses in my electorate, helping them to invest and create more jobs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand it's essential to support small business to find the skilled workforce they need to create these jobs. There are nearly 40,000 students studying vocational education in my electorate, and 2,200 of them are completing apprenticeships. I visited Barrington College in Southport as a candidate and more recently I attended its launch. The CEO, Colleen Gauder, and her team are doing a fantastic job connecting competent and passionate students with our local hospitality and tourism industries—key industries on the Gold Coast and in my electorate. I am thrilled to see that this budget invests so much in improving the skills of the Australian workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, I was hoping you could clarify how the skills package measures in the budget will support nearly 32,000 small businesses in Moncrieff in accessing skilled, high-quality staff, as well as make Australians see apprenticeships and vocational training as an attractive career pathway for their future in our great country.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BIRD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to jump in on this debate. Hopefully, I can cover what I want to talk about in five minutes. The minister made his opening statement in this portfolio area with a focus on the skills component of the portfolio, and I acknowledge some of the initiatives that he talked about that are part of these appropriation bills that we're looking at. But I want to say to the minister that this is a very small drop in the ocean, given the massive cuts that have been made to this sector over six years, three prime ministers and—to be quite honest, I've lost count of how many ministers have had responsibility. I want to briefly talk about what they are and lead into my questions for the minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen whilst this government, over six years, has been in place is the loss of over 150,000 apprentices. Again, this week, national reports indicate the significance of this loss. This has been a direct result of the cuts of over $3 billion that have occurred, time and time again, under this government since the first budget of the Abbott government in 2014. I will acknowledge that, before the election, Tony Abbott promised that apprentices would be better off under his government, if they were elected. Yet, in the very first Abbott budget, they slashed $2 billion from apprentices, skills, vocational education and training, including a whopping $1 billion from apprenticeship programs, and the cuts did not stop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott government hit hard. They axed a billion dollars and demolished the Tools for Your Trade program, which supported apprentices to buy the equipment they needed. They slashed a further billion dollars of investment in skills by cutting funding to programs such as the National Workforce Development Fund, the Workplace English Language and Literacy program, the Australian Apprenticeships Access Program, the Accelerated Australian Apprenticeships program, the Australian apprentices mentoring program and the Apprentice to Business Owner Program that helped apprentices transition to become their own small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They did announce a much smaller program, the Industry Skills Fund, which was only $27 million in the first year and wound down to $1.9 million in the 2018-19 budget. In November 2014, we learnt the Abbott government was taking the axe to funding for the Joint Group Training Program: $12.5 million; 20 per cent in that year, and the program was completely gone by 2015-16. Just a month later, in December 2014, adult apprentices were dealt a blow with the announcement of a $66 million cut to direct adult apprentice assistance payments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before their second budget, in anticipation of their contempt for schools and training, key peak national industry bodies warned the government in pre-budget submissions about the problems that were occurring with not investing in skills and training. There were statements by the AIG, the Business Council of Australia and the ACTU, to no avail. In the second budget, there was a 20 per cent cut in funding across the portfolio, including abolishing Industry Skills Councils. Later that year, in the December MYEFO, Malcolm Turnbull promised new leadership but cut a further $273.8 million over four years from the Industry Skills Fund and $122.9 million from the Skills for Education and Employment program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to run out of time to get through all these cuts but I'll do my best. It should have been ringing alarm bells when it then was discovered that there were 100,000 fewer apprentices. But, no, on budget day 2016 they axed a further $247 million from the portfolio and had no new initiatives. On budget day 2017, when there were 130,000 fewer apprentices, they cut another $600 million from the portfolio.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the Prime Minister in question time said that TAFE has nothing to do with the federal government. He said it's a state government responsibility. If we are serious about skills development and the issues that the minister raised in his opening statement, it can't just be rhetoric and it can't be bandaid programs. This government must get back seriously in the business of investing into skills development. I want to ask the minister whether he agrees with the Prime Minister that TAFE is not a federal responsibility and, therefore, doesn't see a role for the federal government in it. How will the minister be arguing to close that chasm in investment, not just with rhetoric?</span>

To start with, I think, all members need to know that the single biggest decline in start-up apprenticeships occurred in 2012-13. The decline was 85,000 apprenticeships. This was one of the single biggest failures of those opposite. Not only that, but, when you look at everything else they did, we have had to spend six years trying to fix this mess. The government has done a terrific job of that. With the Joyce review, we're about to not only clean up their mess but also set the vocational sector up for the future. The percentage of those on welfare is at the lowest level in over 30 years. Almost 1.4 million jobs have been created since we came to office. We continue to see record job growth. There have been 255,600 full-time jobs created in the past year. Those opposite also talk about underemployment and casualisation. It is worth noting that only 5.4 per cent of all part-time workers preferred to work full-time hours and had looked for and were available to start work with more hours. The incidence of casual employment has remained steady for around two decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to small business achievements, our list of success is so great that I won't go into all the details. But I will say for those here that, if they missed the contributions of the member for Moncrieff and the member for Forde, go and listen to them because they detailed what we are doing for small business. It is a lengthy list because we on this side understand how central and important small business is to the foundation of the Australian economy. I'll look forward to discussing more about the Joyce review with the member for Moncrieff when I have more time. Thank you to all those who have contributed to this debate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  The Morrison government really does have a great story to tell on the environment. For nearly 20 years we've had a rigorous and transparent regulatory framework for protecting nationally important environmental matters. Over the last few years, we've made real progress, protecting threatened species. We're funding practical, on-ground action that engages communities in caring for their environment. As well, we have a world-leading investment strategy for protecting the Great Barrier Reef. But there is more work to do. As a country, we need to better manage our waste and think about waste as part of the circular economy. We need to keep up the good work we have been doing on the reef and on threatened species, to name a couple of key areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, what does this year's budget deliver for the environment? There is the Environment Restoration Fund. The government is delivering on its election commitment to increase recycling and reduce waste, protect Australia's biodiversity and restore waterways through the Environment Restoration Fund. These budget bills provide $100 million over the next four years for the fund. The fund will focus on three priority areas: protecting threatened and migratory species and their habitats; protecting Australia's coast, oceans and waterways by addressing erosion, improving water quality and protecting coastal, threatened and migratory species; and the clean-up, recovery and recycling of waste. The Communities Environment Program is another new program based around community-led projects complementing our restoration fund. Volunteers and community groups care passionately about their local environment and they know it better than most. Both the Environment Restoration Fund and the Communities Environment Program will support local groups to achieve their local priorities. The Communities Environment Program will harness that passion by helping grassroots community organisations deliver projects that address local priorities and will reconnect Australians with their local environment. These bills will deliver more than $20 million across Australia through the program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tackling Australia's waste is a key priority for this term of government. An amount of $5.9 million from the Environment Restoration Fund will support initiatives that mobilise communities to remove and reduce plastic waste from coastal regions, preventing it from entering our oceans and waterways, where it has harmful impacts on marine life and the marine economy. An amount of $5.5 million will support ongoing action to halve food waste by 2030, as well as promote recycling and reduce waste. Part of this will be support for Planet Ark and the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation to accomplish a circular economy hub to drive that innovation—establish an online marketplace matching buyers and sellers of waste. Last month, under the leadership of Prime Minister Morrison, state and federal governments committed to banning the export of waste plastic, paper, glass and tyres while building Australia's capacity to generate high-value recycled commodities and build the associated demand. This sets a clear path forward and shows that Australia is serious about improving our resource recovery, increasing our use of recycled materials and building demand and markets for recycled products. We will implement the ban in a way that benefits the Australian economy. We will build the capacity of our waste and recycling sectors. This will create jobs, because one person's trash is another person's treasure. This is part of our government's move to a circular economy, reusing our resources for the benefit of the economy and the environment. It's our waste, it's our environment, it's our responsibility. The Morrison government is getting on with the job by addressing critical environmental issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another key focus for our government is to modernise regulatory frameworks, reduce congestion and deliver benefits to the Australian economy. We are committed to the highest environmental standards. Our central environmental law, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, implemented by the Howard government, establishes a rigorous and transparent regulatory framework for protecting nationally important environmental matters, such as threatened species and World Heritage properties. An independent review of this act is required to commence by the end of October. I want it to be thorough and look comprehensively at the overall effectiveness of the EPBC Act. I want to work closely with the community, industry and across government to look at ways to improve the EPBC Act and better support sustainable growth, lower the regulatory burden and lessen uncertainty while achieving strong outcomes for the environment. The review will involve extensive consultation and I look forward to that and the participation of all members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is more to talk about—the Great Barrier Reef and our threatened species work. I've had something to say about that in recent times. I conclude that we are on track with our most recent budget, and our election commitments, to show this government is delivering on its election promises.</span>

My question is to the Minister for the Environment. Why are truth and science now critically endangered under this government? We are now in the third term of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, but all Australians and their natural environment have no cause for celebration. The Great Barrier Reef has been downgraded from 'poor' to 'very poor', the Murray-Darling Basin is in crisis, the nation's faunal extinction crisis is now one of the worst on the planet, Australia's emissions are continuing to escalate as the Morrison government continues its dangerous spiral of climate and science denial, we're seeing ministerial scandals and incompetence, which are destroying confidence in the management of the environment, and as a consequence our greatest environmental challenges now grow much worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Funding for the environment department has reportedly been slashed since 2013, in line with its capacity to manage environmental issues. In a backroom deal, $444 million of public funds for reef protection was handed, without a tender, to a small, ill-equipped foundation. Just yesterday we saw a senior minister in the government, the minister responsible for water, drought and natural disasters, say that he didn't know if man-made climate change was real.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to recap on the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government's greatest hits on the environment. The Great Barrier Reef—No. 1: reef health, as I said, has been downgraded from 'poor' to 'very poor'. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority recently downgraded the reef's condition and has become more desperate for action, making an unprecedented call for the strongest and fastest possible action to reduce climate emissions.</span>

He is refusing to accept the truth that climate change is a key threat to the reef. In recent reports he's even been insisting that coral bleaching has been happening for millennia, contrary to scientific evidence, including in the minister's own department. The question is: how could you be an envoy for the reef when you don't understand its greatest threats?</span>

                    </a>  Well, it just seemed to go on for so much longer. You really wouldn't think that she believed what she was saying. We believe what we're saying. We believe in the strong actions we're taking to protect the environment and to engage local communities in that protection. We don't sit on our hands and say it's all too hard or get overwhelmed by international and national challenges; we work hard with key targets in mind and a key focus that brings strong effort from across the government, across the nation and, indeed, across the world. While the member for Griffith appears to want to run down what's happening in the environment portfolio, I would like to talk it up. I would like to talk up our international standing on the oceans and the fact that we have, I say, the best managed reef in the world—certainly to a gold standard. We are investing record dollars in that reef. In fact, it's $1.2 billion—so much more than Labor ever did.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, there was that mention of the $400 million that went to the reef foundation. When has a political party in this place, caring about the World Heritage values of the reef, turned its back on $400 million? Only this Labor Party has done that, and I have no idea why.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't resile from the challenges that we face. I've said the No. 1 threat to the reef is climate change. I've acknowledged on Threatened Species Day that the changing rate of climate is a challenge for some of our species. There is absolutely no argument from me with the science. I talk to scientists regularly and I ask them these questions. I'm not afraid of a single thing they say to me. But I also know that Australians are 100 per cent committed to playing their part. Conservation, indeed, is everyone's business. When you look at Threatened Species Day here in the House yesterday, it was delightful to see the member for Griffith cuddling a koala—and I do acknowledge her real interest in koalas—</span>

                    </a>  And a Tassie devil. These are things we are doing with our Environment Restoration Fund, which I spoke of. We have got $6 million for koala corridors and hospitals.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, the climate is changing. This is a global issue. It's not something Australians can stand up and change tomorrow. But what we can do is say, 'Here is a vulnerable species. How can we invest in the science?' We know there are too many koalas in South Australia and the genetic diversity is not great, but we know that they love to live where people live, which is where the member for Griffith lives, and we want to protect those populations. We invite her, when the time comes, to be involved in the koala restoration project through that fund. We engage all members. We can stand up as a political party and as a government and look every single Australian in the eye and say, 'We recognise the challenges, but we are here working with you to meet those challenges.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were a couple of mentions of the budget. This is a budget conversation; I understand that.

We have an international reputation. We have the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the scientists we have on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and our wonderful envoy, who was unfairly targeted in that speech, and the passion he brings for the tourism industry and the farmers who live along the reef. We didn't hear a mention of farmers, who protect over 60 per cent of Australia's land mass, from the shadow environment—</span>

                    </a>  The member for Forde is mentioning various other members. It is so important to just remember that farmers, landcare and the partnership between conservation and agriculture land exactly on the same page with feral animals. We didn't mention feral animals, but I say there is a 'million paws stalk' across Australia every night, with the cats that are killing our native wildlife—up to six million a night, which is pretty horrific. But, again, do we sit on our hands and say, 'It's all too hard; we haven't got enough money; we haven't got enough staff; we can't manage anything,' or do we actually get down, roll up our sleeves, get our hands dirty and do something out there in the real world and the real economy?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:52</span>):  My question is to the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction. It goes to the heart of his responsibilities. The question is: what has been happening to Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, in absolute terms, under this government? Have they been decreasing, as his ministerial title and duties require, or have they been increasing?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change is a challenge which will have serious effects on future generations of Australians and is already impacting all Australians. Yet this government has washed its hands of serious action to tackle climate change by reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. We have had a rolling public policy catastrophe on climate and energy from those opposite. Three successive prime ministers have put politics ahead of principle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the former Prime Minister, Mr Abbott. Mr Abbott's destructive approach to climate policy is one of the most irresponsible contributions to Australian public life in the modern era. He was knocked off by the former member for Wentworth, Mr Turnbull. Mr Turnbull claimed to be the moderate face of the Liberal Party on climate and energy policy, but he was held to ransom by the hard Right in the Liberal Party—people like the current Minister for Energy, who blocked the National Energy Guarantee and is now even blocking state Liberal governments from trying to fix up energy policy in this country. Then Mr Turnbull was knocked off by the current Prime Minister, and the current Prime Minister has been just as bad as his predecessors. He flew to Tuvalu for the Pacific Islands Forum meeting earlier this year and, in a country which risks being submerged by rising sea levels, he got out his red pen and watered down the calls for action on climate change in the forum communique.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a policy failure with profound implications. Australians are already starting to bear the cost of this government's inaction, and we will only see these costs grow in coming years: the environmental costs of damage to iconic natural assets like the Great Barrier Reef and changes to our native ecosystems and habitats; the economic costs from longer droughts hitting our farmers, severe weather events disrupting communities and rising sea levels and storm surges damaging our coastal infrastructure; and the health costs which will come from heatwaves, which will put the elderly and the vulnerable at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians want to us do our fair share in tackling climate change with all countries of the world, but this government has adopted a woefully inadequate emissions reduction target. The scientific advice is that to contribute to the Paris Agreement's goal of holding temperature increases to less than two degrees Australia needs to reduce emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by 2050. But this government has committed only to a reduction of 26 to 28 per cent by 2030, and it is undermining this target with a dodgy accounting trick, using Kyoto carryover units to deliver much less than a 26 to 28 per cent reduction by 2030. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The worst thing about this government's approach is that not only is its emissions reduction target inadequate and not only is it using an accounting trick to weaken a target even further but it has no actual policies for even achieving this low-ball target—no policies for reducing emissions from the energy sector; no policies for reducing emissions from the transport sector; no policies for reducing emissions from the industrial sector; and no policies for reducing emissions from the land sector. So it's hardly surprising that emissions are going up, not down. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the former Labor government, emissions were falling while the economy kept growing strongly. Under this government, they are rising and rising at a faster pace with each year of inaction. As last week's national accounts show, under this government economic growth is stalling just like wages and investment. We have a Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction who is presiding over emissions and price increases—not reductions—blocking reforms in the energy sector and failing to put our economy on a path for a clean energy and low-emissions future. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additional questions to the minister are simple. Will the minister admit Australia's absolute emissions have gone up every year since 2014? What do the official figures project Australia's absolute emissions will be in the year 2020 and the year 2030 compared to 2005? I urge the minister to actually talk about absolute levels of emissions, not per capita or some other emissions intensity measure, which is the way they try to get around this. Because absolute emissions are actually what we are obliged to account for under the Paris treaty and under the Kyoto treaty. They can talk about per capita. They can talk about per GDP. That means nothing compared to absolute levels which we are legally and morally obliged to do. The minister, if he was being honest for once, will admit that our absolute emissions have gone up every year since 2014. If the minister wants to start this debate properly, he will admit that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  I'm pleased to have the opportunity to ask the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction some questions, because every day I hear from people in my electorate of Lindsay who are wanting to know how the Morrison government is working to reduce the cost of living pressures on hardworking families. Cost of living pressures put a strain on household budgets, and this is particularly true when it comes to energy prices. That's why our focus in the Morrison government is on lowering energy prices and gas prices so we can put more money back in the pockets of hardworking families and to the bottom lines of the 14,000 small and medium-sized businesses in Lindsay. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're backing small businesses in Lindsay with tax relief and encouraging them to grow by extending the instant asset write-off. Lowering energy costs is just another way that we're enabling our local small businesses to employ more people and take advantage of new opportunities to grow and expand. Emu Plains Automotive Repairs is just one of the small businesses in Lindsay run by a hardworking aspirational Australian. In May this year I met with Shane of Emu Plains Automotive Repairs, and he told me that lowering power prices means that his business can grow. Energy companies can't get away with ripping off people like Shane. Local businesses like Emu Plains Automotive Repairs are at the heart and soul of our community. That's why the Morrison government is committed to backing Shane and Emu Plains Automotive Repairs and all the other small businesses in Lindsay with reforms to lower power prices. </span>

It is probably going to suit the minister that he gets a go after me rather than before me because my question is to the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction. When is the minister going to resign? He should resign or be sacked by the Prime Minister. The minister has previously claimed that he was representing his constituents when he sought a meeting with environment department officials on the environmental listing of the Monaro grasslands in March 2017. Yesterday in question time Labor revealed that Minister Taylor has told ABC Radio that he was advocating for himself as a landholder. I'll read you the interview transcript:</span>

It's very clear that the minister has no idea why it would be a problem that he would be using his own ministerial powers to stand up for himself without declaring his interest in the matter. It is obviously a mystery to him why the people of Australia would expect him to make the declarations that would be required under the ministerial code of conduct and the parliamentary declarations. In that regard, we already know that the minister failed to declare his joint financial interest in Jam Land Pty Ltd, a company which to this day is under investigation by his own department.</span>

On that basis, given that this is in relation to the expenditure in the environment department, I ask that the minister explain why his own department is to this day investigating a company in which he has a personal interest.

Secondly, the minister took issue with my concerns about the expenditure of $444 million in a backroom deal to a small ill-equipped foundation which failed to comply fully with the rules designed to ensure transparency and value for money on the matter. Minister, why wasn't there an appropriate tender process and why do you think it doesn't matter that there wasn't transparency in relation to that process? Finally, does the minister agree with her own science agencies on reef health and key threats? I note that she defended the member for Leichhardt's contribution on the issue of bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef. Does the minister accept that the reef envoy was incorrect in his claims that there had been bleaching of that nature at— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That's on the back of the DMO and the reference price—important initiatives recommended by the ACCC and being implemented by this government. As we look at wholesale prices, as we go forward, they are coming down over the next couple of years to just above $70 a megawatt hour. That's a 30 per cent reduction on where we currently sit. Crucial to this is more supply and reliability in the market. We have an investment boom going on in energy right now and it's nearly all intermittent.

And that's why our emissions in electricity are coming down at a rapid rate—2.1 per cent last year—and it's also why we will reach our Paris obligations, just as we reached our Kyoto obligations. In fact, not only did we reach our earlier Kyoto obligation, our 2020 obligation, as of December last year, but we are on track to beat it by 367 million tonnes. It's important to note that this is a 1.1 billion tonne turnaround on what we inherited from those opposite—from deficit to surplus. That's what we do: clean up Labor's mess. </span>

That package includes crucial initiatives to get our emissions down, including the Climate Solutions Fund, which will deliver 102 million tonnes of abatement; energy efficiency initiatives, which will deliver 63 million tonnes of abatement; and hydro projects—Snowy 2.0 and the Battery of the Nation project—which will deliver 25 million tonnes of abatement. In combination, the initiatives in the Climate Solutions Package have us on target to reach our Paris obligations, as we will reach them in electricity, well ahead of time. In fact, I'd like to point out and confirm to the Chamber that we expect to reach our Paris targets in 2021, nine years ahead of schedule. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHARMA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:11</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the Morrison government's budget for the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio and the impact it will have on our Pacific step-up. The Pacific is our home, and it's where we can have the most genuine impact and contribution on the international stage. As the Prime Minister says, 'It's our patch and it's our backyard.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2019-20 budget underscores Australia's commitment to step up our engagement in the Pacific and our broader region and to work across government to further Australia's security and prosperity in a contested world. We're committing $12.7 million in additional resources to the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific. The facility will use grant funding provided alongside loans to significantly deepen Australia's support for high-priority infrastructure projects in the Pacific and Timor-Leste, reaffirming our commitment to work with Pacific partners to support their development priorities. This facility opened on 1 July this year and will invest in high-priority infrastructure across the Pacific in areas such as telecommunications, energy, transport and water and other essential infrastructure such as the Highlands Highway in Papua New Guinea. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also investing in greater collaboration between all of our Pacific neighbours, with $3.9 million going towards developing measures to guard against foreign interference. This strategy will mobilise international collaboration towards stronger global norms and against inappropriate interference and will enable cooperation with regional partners. As part of a broader measure led by the Department of Home Affairs, DFAT will implement a program to support these efforts in our region and more broadly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has also committed $4 billion in official development assistance, $1.4 billion of which will be directed towards our Pacific neighbours. This is a third of our total aid budget and reflects our enduring ties with our nearest neighbours. It's our highest ever aid spend in the region. We're also increasing humanitarian funding to $450 million, ensuring that Australia can respond rapidly to help those affected by humanitarian crises and allow us to continue to respond to unprecedented levels of displacement and humanitarian need across the globe. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also committed $44 million to establish a new National Foundation for Australia-China Relations, investing in one of our most important bilateral relationships. The foundation will provide a new and innovative platform to provide practical support and expertise to Australians developing links and exchanges with Chinese counterparts. It will harness the efforts of the private sector, peak bodies, NGOs, cultural organisations, state and federal agencies and the Chinese-Australian community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia will also step up its engagement on maritime issues in South-East Asia, building on our long history of maritime support across the Indo-Pacific. We will deepen our investment in maritime cooperation, including on regional maritime organisations; maritime domain awareness; illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing; and support for a rules-based maritime order. Since announcing the Pacific Step-up last year there has been a major refocusing of our efforts within foreign policy, aid, defence and policing strategies to make sure that the Pacific is our highest priority. This is important for ongoing prosperity and security in Australia as well as for the prosperity and security of our region as a whole.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to refocusing our efforts on our own region of the Pacific, the government's budget has continued funding of Govpass, a trusted digital identity, a key component in the further digital transformation of government. The additional $4.1 million in funding supports the government's commitment to better and more accessible digital services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A South Pacific that is secure strategically, stable economically and sovereign politically is in Australia's national interest. This government has made that achievement a priority. The Pacific is front and centre as our strategic priority, right where it should be, and I'm proud to be part of a government that is leading from the front on these important issues. I wish to acknowledge the work of the <span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for International Development and the Pacific</span>, who is here this evening. I ask the minister to please explain to the chamber how the government's budget will continue to support the Pacific Step-up and our engagement in the region.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249127" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONROY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  My question is also to the Minister for International Development and the Pacific. It concerns Australia's engagement with the Pacific region and our program of official development assistance. The question is: why is the government sabotaging its own Pacific Step-up policy and why is it damaging Australia's foreign policy interests by slashing development assistance?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our relations with the countries of the Pacific Ocean and our international development programs are central elements of Australia's foreign policy. They are both areas that are important to Australia's national interests and they are both areas that are important to Australia's standing in our region and our projection of Australian values in the international community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the high-level principles articulated by this government on Pacific issues and international development there is a bipartisan approach, but when it comes to the way that this government is implementing its policies we see cause for concern. We see a government that says it wants a step up in Australia's Pacific relations but which is undermining its Pacific policies through inaction on climate change, contradictory policies on labour mobility, and failing to treat our Pacific partners with basic respect. It is a government that risks turning the Pacific Step-up into a Pacific stuff-up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On international development, we see a government that has cut $11.8 billion from Australia's aid budget since 2013. These cuts are having negative impacts on some of the poorest people in the world and they are having negative impacts on Australia's interests and our standing in the international community. Overseas development assistance is a key part of our foreign policy. It's the way we support economic, social and human development in low- and middle-income nations. It also reflects the Australian character—a generous nation committed to the fair go, helping people who need help, and doing our bit to respond to humanitarian crises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a region where millions of people live in extreme poverty it's in Australia's interests to strengthen our commitment through development. Development means greater prosperity, security and stability in our region, yet since the coalition government came to office in 2013 it has cut $11.8 billion from the aid budget, run down the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's skills, and outsourced delivery of an increasing number of programs to contractors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The aid cuts have broken the bipartisan consensus in Australia about the level of investment we need to make in tackling global poverty. We've gone from an aid budget worth 0.33 per cent of Australia's gross national income in 2013-14 to one worth just 0.21 per cent of GNI in 2019-20. The government needs to stop the cuts and start rebuilding the international development program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Pacific is a region where Australia has longstanding responsibilities as one of the most advanced economies in the region. It's a region that faces challenges, such as a lack of economic opportunity; the need to improve health, education and gender equality; climate change; rising strategic competition; and security threats from illegal fishing to drug smuggling. It's squarely in Australia's national interest to help our Pacific neighbours meet these challenges. So we welcome the coalition's renewed focus on the region, after neglecting the Pacific for most of its first two terms. We're happy to extend support for the Pacific Step-up, but we have serious concerns that the government is undermining its own step up. Pacific leaders have declared that climate change is the most significant threat to their people. That means the coalition's inaction on climate change is harming Australia's standing in the Pacific. We saw that play out dramatically at this year's Pacific Islands Forum meeting in Tuvalu.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw a lack of respect for our Pacific neighbours from the Deputy Prime Minister saying Pacific islanders don't need to worry about rising sea levels, 'because they can come to Australia to pick our fruit'. We have seen a disappointing start to the new Pacific Labour Scheme, because of the government's deregulation of the backpacker visa scheme. That's why I say that the government is sabotaging its own Pacific step-up through a mixture of arrogance, incompetence and policy contradiction. We saw that in the member for Wentworth's contribution where he didn't mention climate change once. How can he talk about our relationship with the Pacific for five minutes and not talk about climate change once? It reflects this government's innate contradictions.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw the Fijian Prime Minister—who is arriving tomorrow or who might, I think, be here today—talk about Prime Minister Morrison's insulting and condescending behaviour at the PIF. We saw their reaction to the Deputy Prime Minister's outrageous remarks where the Prime Minister of Fiji again said they've taken 'a big step backwards' in their relationship because of McCormack's comments.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My questions to the minister are: why did the Prime Minister alienate his counterparts at the Pacific Islands Forum? Can the minister confirm that Australian official development assistance will fall by 0.2 per cent of gross national income next financial year? Will he be locking away the Deputy Prime Minister in a dark box so he's not allowed near the Pacific again?</span>

                    </a>  Maybe so. I also welcome the member for Wakefield's very valued service. We appreciate his contribution. We hope he goes well in New York.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the member for Shortland I would say, of course, he is prone to inflated rhetoric from time to time. He does suffer from one very serious ailment and that is believing what he reads in the media. It's a condition that we can assist you with. I wouldn't take all of your news—entirely about what is happening in the Pacific—from what you read in the papers. You may end up with the wrong inflection on what is actually occurring on the ground.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, since the government announced its Pacific step up, we are, of course, delivering a greater contribution to the Pacific than any other government in history. We're working with our partners through our aid budget—and I welcome the questions on the aid budget. We have had an election in the last six months. In the election there were radically different proposals put forward in the aid budget from the Labor Party and the government, and the people endorsed the government's proposals for the aid budget—that is, to spend $4 billion this year in ODA, including a record $1.4 billion of that for the Pacific. That's the highest amount we've spent on the Pacific.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the PIF the Prime Minister made the important announcement that we'll spend $500 million for the Pacific specifically. That is a record amount on climate change spending for the Pacific. We'll have a record spend, record expenditure, on climate change in the Pacific, and we're delivering more than ever before for the Pacific out of our ODA budget. It is a bit disingenuous to purport that there have been radical cuts and big damage to our relationships. In fact, the bilateral relationships we have with all of our Pacific partners are strong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can record that Prime Minister Morrison is respected and well regarded by leaders across the Pacific. You don't need to read the papers about that. Prime Minister Bainimarama is coming here this week on an official state visit to sign the vuvale partnership—the family partnership. The links that we have with Fiji are strong, vibrant and ongoing. We respect them, and they respect us. That partnership will endure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to say also that the aid budget is a contentious area from time to time. The government has maintained the funding. Even in an environment where we are in budget repair, we've kept our ODA budget at the level that we believe is sustainable. The Australian people have endorsed that policy and they have rejected the radical spending of the Labor Party and the taxes that go with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you don't believe me on that, Mr Deputy Speaker, I think it can be very important sometimes to listen to your own side. I think it was a former foreign minister from the Labor Party who made a very astute point about the aid budget. He did that in a book that I know the member for Shortland will be passionate about it and will have read thoroughly and will probably have dog-eared bookmarks in, <span style="font-style:italic;">Diary of a Foreign Minister</span> by Bob Carr. He made a very important point about the aid budget, which I think the member could take on board in response to his questions. He said that you can't run the aid budget on borrowings. I thought that was probably the most sensible thing I've ever heard Bob Carr say. You can't run the aid budget on borrowings. It doesn't make sense to borrow for our aid budget. He was right about that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has the aid budget on a sustainable footing, ensuring that we are spending it in the region on the projects that our Pacific partners tell us are the priorities for the Pacific. We are, of course, engaging bilaterally. We're engaging at a multilateral level. We're making sure that the priorities of the Pacific are what dictate what our aid budget is spent on, and we're finding that process is ensuring climate adaptation and climate resilience projects—practical projects on the ground in the Pacific that will deliver real change and real outcomes for the Pacific people. The Pacific is our family. It's our backyard. They're the most important relationships that Australia has. They're regarded this way by the government. The Pacific step-up will continue. It'll be well resourced by this government.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MADELEINE KING</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:26</span>):  My question on this appropriation is for the Minister for Regional Services, Decentralisation and Local Government and the Assistant Trade and Investment Minister. On 31 July this year, the minister claimed before the House that he does not believe that Labor managed to sign a free trade agreement in government. After that, I asked the minister to correct the record, as, of course, the statement was untrue. He did give a bit of a clarification—a Clayton's clarification, if you like—all for a bit of low-rate political pointscoring. So my first question is: why did the assistant minister seek to turn trade, a matter of extraordinary national significance, into a partisan matter for cheap political pointscoring? As I will run out of time, I'll ask my second question: will the minister commit to genuine bipartisanship on trade agreements and trade issues into the future, given the especially turbulent global context and strain on Australia's critically important economic and strategic diplomatic relationships in our region and beyond?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was completely disingenuous for the minister to not only imply but directly state before the House that Labor has not signed a free trade agreement in government. Labor supports trade between Australia and the rest of the world because trade generates economic growth, creates jobs, improves living standards and reduces poverty all throughout our region. Labor has a long record as an advocate for an open global trading system and knows that reducing barriers to trade creates more competitive industries and benefits consumers throughout the whole region through lower prices and greater choice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Chifley, Whitlam, Hawke and Keating went out to the regions long before those opposite ever thought of it. Labor signed the Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement in 2008. It entered into force in 2009. Labor signed the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area agreement in February 2009. It entered into force in 2010. This powerhouse multilateral economic partnership involves Australia, New Zealand and significant developing Asian economies—Brunei, Burma, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam, as well as Laos, Cambodia and Indonesia, who entered the agreement in 2011 and 2012. Additionally, Labor signed the Malaysia-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which entered into force in January 2013. These trade agreements combined opened up the dialogue for Australia and its regional trading partners, paving the way for future multilateral negotiations and diplomacy such as we saw and agreed to in the CPTPP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's obvious and it's true that Labor has a rich history of spearheading strong free trade agreements and fostering economic partnerships in government, despite what the assistant minister tried to allege. In fact, it was the Hawke Labor government's deregulation of the Australian financial sector in the 1980s and, in particular, floating of the dollar which made Australia's commodities globally competitive and catapulted our export sector to become the economic powerhouse we know today. Labor in opposition supported the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which bolstered our trade relationship with our greatest economic partner—a relationship built on a rich history of trade and investment. The value of our trade relationship with China is enormous and accounts for a third of our export wealth. As such, ratifying ChAFTA was integral to continuing Australian export growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supported the TPP-11, which includes developing economies in our region such as Vietnam and Malaysia, which would only aid growth in the region and is already strengthening and broadening the appeal of Australian standards such as fair industrial relations laws transnationally. The CPTPP has been integral to diversifying Australia's economy and trading relationships, which, in the current context of the very regrettable US-China trade tensions and the sluggish global economy—not to mention a sluggish domestic economy—is even more important to our ongoing economic security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will continue to work with the reasonable members of this parliament, industry and union stakeholders, because bolstering our regional trade relationships is in the best interests of all Australians. The minister and his party partake in petty politics, treating international trade agreements as conquests, like notches on a guitar. Trade negotiations are for the long term. They take time—they should take time. They go over multiple terms of government, particularly if you seek high-quality, lasting, multilateral trade agreements that benefit all actors involved. If the government would commit to taking a bipartisan approach to trade, Australia will benefit, as it is only through a productive bipartisan approach to international trade that the parties of government can resist movements that seek to blame free and open trade and demonise it for domestic political purposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an obligation on this government, on Labor as the alternative government, and on the business community to ensure the wider community does indeed benefit from open trading relationships in the world and to argue that the benefits outweigh the negatives. We saw what happened when the US used domestic politics to weaponise international free trade. The TPP became a flashpoint. It was abandoned by the US. If this government continues to use this as a partisan game, the same will happen in Australia. It will rest on your shoulders, and you should be aware of that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Trade is an issue that needs to be treated in a bipartisan way. I am certainly looking forward to the cooperation of the shadow minister on the three agreements that will be coming up soon before the House: the free trade agreement with Indonesia, the free trade agreement with Hong Kong and the free trade agreement with Peru. It would be good if the shadow minister were taking some notice of this—I am answering the questions she put to me. With the signing of the agreements over the last couple of years, the trade agenda of this government has certainly had benefits for Australia. I look forward to the cooperation of the Labor Party in ensuring that the three agreements before us now are ratified by this parliament in order to ensure that we can get the benefit that will flow from having a free trade agreement with Indonesia, our closest neighbour to the north, with its large population. Australian exporters are looking forward to the benefits that will flow from that agreement, as with the Hong Kong and Peru agreements. This government has a strong agenda on free trade. We have been successful in signing agreements and we look forward to the ones before us. We also look to the EU and obviously we're watching very closely what happens to Brexit. We have officials on the ground to make sure that Australia can react as quickly as it can to the circumstances in which we find ourselves. The member for Spence might have to pick up on his diplomatic skills as he heads to the UN! This government has a proud record on free trade. We look forward to the agreements before us.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  I won't take the full five minutes—maybe four minutes and 55 seconds! I did want to ask the Treasurer—it's a shame he didn't have the time to be with us—about what the strategy is for increasing Australia's trade and economic engagement with Indo-Pacific economies in the next six years. In the last six years, there have been some free trade agreements, but (1) we need high-quality free agreements and (2) increasing trade and economic advantage for Australian businesses is a bit more than just free trade agreements—you've got to do a bit more than that. So I was keen to find out what the Treasurer or any of the honourable members opposite have in mind. There's been a lot of marketing in the trade space. Six years ago this government boasted it was more focused on Jakarta than Geneva, but it's really taken its eye off the ball in the Indo-Pacific. That's why I'm keen to ask these questions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The revised Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, the TPP, didn't capture all the fast-growing markets to our north. The RCEP, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which has the potential to deliver significant opportunities for the Australian economy, is becoming famous for its curious case of shrinking ambitions. I was keen to see what any of the honourable members had to say about that. For years, we've heard promises of substantial conclusion to RCEP by year's end, along with promises of a high-quality deal. But, if you prioritise speed for political gain, as those opposite quite often do, then the quality, obviously, will suffer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do acknowledge the bipartisan work on IA-CEPA—negotiating that with Indonesia. From our point of view, our caucus is yet to come to a conclusion and fully consider its position on this. But it's fair to say that signing another deal is not a serious strategy to expand our exports to the region. There's more required than that, particularly at a time when the need to diversify our trade portfolio is becoming painfully obvious. Bragging about a trade surplus has more to do with a mine closing in Brazil than it does with the government's policies. It's not a serious strategy, which is why I'm keen to hear from those opposite, if the time allows and if they want to get up and answer a question—</span>

                    </a>  Blaming the so-called complexity of the global trade climate is not a serious strategy, gentlemen. I have to say you can smell the confusion and blatant lack of any real plan in the government when every second word it utters is an attack on us, an attack on Labor. The only visible plan that I see is a bit of denial, a bit of deflection and a bit of blame, and the government's trade agenda seems to be similar. There's been wonderful marketing but zero long-term planning, from what I can see, so I'm keen to hear a bit more over and above what the honourable member's already offered. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's lots of growth going on in our region. We all know that, but we need to kick some real economic goals. A real plan for the economy includes some infrastructure investment—that's really got to happen. The Reserve Bank Governor keeps on stressing the importance of that. If we don't have a real plan on regional trade, then we're not going to be able to grasp all of the massive benefits that are going to come in the future. I said I wouldn't take the full five minutes, so I won't. I want to thank you, Deputy Speaker Hogan, for giving me the opportunity to have a bit of a yarn, and I look forward to the next opportunity.</span>

In relation to this geographical specification, in responding to other QoNs received from Mr Hill we have supplied information about applicants' preferred council for ceremony attendance as an alternative, where this information is sufficiently recorded in Departmental systems to support a response. However, in relation to this question on applicants whose applications have been refused, preferred council information is not sufficiently recorded. This is because a client's preferred council for ceremony attendance may not be recorded in Departmental systems for cases where a refusal outcome has occurred.</span>
