                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South </span><span class="HPS-Electorate">Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:32</span>):  The Climate Change Bill 2022 is an important step forward because it acknowledges that we need to cut carbon pollution in order to put our climate on a safe footing, but it goes nowhere near enough. We know that we can't keep opening up new coal and gas, putting more pollution into the atmosphere, if we are to stop dangerous, runaway climate change. And yet here today we see an example in the expansion of a coalmine in New South Wales on the table before the Minister for Environment and Water, waiting for her green light. I call on the minister today: if you are serious about reducing pollution, if you are serious about stopping climate change, if you are serious about protecting our environment, you will reject this coalmine application. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, the problem we have here is that our environment laws as they stand don't even require the minister to consider the climate damage of a big project like the expansion of the largest coalmine in several years. In fact, if this coalmine is approved, it will be the largest coalmine opened since Australia signed the Paris Agreement. It will be a huge step backwards. It will make it harder for us to cut pollution. It will make it harder for us to stop the droughts, the floods and the deathly bushfires. It will make it harder for our children to know and believe and trust that their future will be one with a safe climate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to fix our environment laws. We need to ensure that all approvals for these big projects—coal, gas—are assessed for their climate damage, and we need a climate trigger in our environment laws to do that. So, while this bill is an important step forward in acknowledging that our task now is to cut pollution, we need the tools in the toolbox to do it. We need the action to follow. This bill won't deliver the action, but it does deliver the promise. The government must step up now, meet this promise and accept that coal and gas are not the way of the future. We need an investment in renewable energy, we need an investment in biodiversity and we need to start protecting the future of the next generation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can't be serious about tackling climate change if you keep green-lighting new coal and gas. Our global partners understand this. The International Energy Agency understands this. The UN and comparable countries understand this. Even the Pope gets it. You can't be serious about tackling climate change and cutting pollution if you keep making the situation worse by allowing the development of new coal and gas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know it is a struggle for the Labor government. I know they've got members within their own ranks who don't see it like this. But sometimes politics requires pragmatism. Often, politics requires leadership. Always, politics requires courage. And here, today, there is a challenge before the environment minister herself. If you're serious about tackling climate change and if you're serious about the impact of this bill making one iota of a difference, you will block the application before you for the expansion of the coalmine in New South Wales, at Mount Pleasant. Send a real signal to the market and people of Australia that you are serious about reducing pollution and stopping climate change.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:37</span>):  It is a pleasure to rise to speak on this bill today, the Climate Change Bill 2022, an incredibly important bill, and a related bill. I want to contribute to the debate on this bill in my role as a senator based in regional Queensland because this bill is important for regional Australians. I rise to speak on this bill in my role as Special Envoy for the Great Barrier Reef because this bill is important for the protection of the Great Barrier Reef. I also rise to speak on this bill as a senator who has a very special relationship with the traditional owners of the Torres Strait, because this bill is important for First Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, during this debate, we will hear views from across this chamber. Some—those opposite—will say that this bill is unnecessary and they don't support it, and others will say that this bill doesn't do enough. Well, both sides of that debate want to continue the climate wars. As a member of this government, I am proud to speak on this bill, to support it and to call for an end to the climate wars today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am so proud to be part of a government that has listened and is acting. After almost a decade of denial and delay and infighting from the former Liberal-National government, finally we have a Labor government and finally we are seeing real action on climate change. I am proud to be part of a government advancing this bill and I'm proud to be a senator who lives in regional Australia who is supporting this bill—because the truth is, if you support regional Australia, then you would support this Climate Change Bill. Regional Australians have the most to gain from this bill being passed, and they have the most to lose if it fails. Regional Australians want to see an end to the climate wars. I concede they do not want convoys rolling into their towns, telling them how to think, but they also don't support a government that puts its head in the sand and tells them that nothing needs to change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will create jobs in regional Australia. This bill will save jobs in regional Australia. This bill will create new industries in regional Australia. This bill will reduce the cost of living because it will invest in cleaner and cheaper energy by signalling that that is what this government intends to do. This bill will ensure that regional Australians make the most of the opportunities that action on climate change creates. This bill provides certainty for regional Australians. And this bill is welcomed by business and industry because it sets the pathway forward, after 10 years of delays. This bill acknowledges that our farmers are on the front line of climate change and have been calling for a coherent climate policy for years. Regional Australians that live on and live off the land support this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill acknowledges that our First Nations Australians will be the first Australians impacted by climate change. Those regional Australians living in the most remote parts of Australia and in the Torres Strait welcome this step forward. They welcome this bill because, as custodians of the land and the sea country, they are already witnessing the impact of climate change on their homelands. I know that that is uncomfortable for those opposite to understand, but the Torres Strait and those First Nations communities are part of regional Australia too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, this bill takes the necessary steps to protect one of the biggest economic assets in regional Australia, the Great Barrier Reef. As Special Envoy for the Great Barrier Reef and a Far North Queenslander, this is especially important to me and the communities that I serve. The reef is not only a beautiful natural wonder; it is an economic powerhouse. The reef contributes more than $6.4 billion each year to the Australian economy and supports around 64,000 full-time jobs. And, yes, the reef is resilient. We have seen from recent reports that the reef is being managed very well. It is a wonderful place to visit and attracts tourism from around the world, but the greatest threat remains. As those reports indicate, the greatest threat to the Great Barrier Reef and the jobs that rely on it remains climate change. Climate change continues to be the greatest threat to the economic powerhouse that is the Great Barrier Reef. Let's be very clear on this. The former Liberal-National government dangerously threatened the Great Barrier Reef both in real terms and reputationally across the globe. They threatened the Great Barrier Reef by failing to take action on climate change, and in doing so they threatened the reputation of the reef by placing the reef at risk of an 'endangered' listing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That type of recklessness stops today. The Albanese Labor government is getting on with the job. We've heard the message and we are delivering today. We know that this vital step is not just about how our nation stands on the world stage but about the jobs and the stability that come from this bill. Despite what others in this chamber might claim, it is time to end the climate wars and it's time to support this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to the bill more broadly, it is important to be clear about what it will achieve. After a decade of denial and delay on climate, and chaos on renewable energy and energy more broadly, Labor's Climate Change Bill will give the certainty so desperately needed by businesses, industry, energy investors and the wider community. With a 2030 target of 43 per cent, this bill will put Australia on track for net zero by 2050. It's not just symbolic, and our targets are a floor, not a ceiling. This kind of certainty is important to ensuring Australia reaps the economic benefits of the energy transformation already underway in the rest of the world. We are legislating 2030 and 2050 net zero targets because it is best practice to do so. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also will restore transparency and accountability in government action on climate change, and it confirms the important role of independent expert advice. The minister will be required to report annually to parliament on Australia's progress towards meeting our targets set in the bill, and this will keep the government accountable for the actions we are taking to reduce emissions. No longer will the national government in this country be able to put their heads in the sand, or wish to do so, because we are including transparency and accountability measures in this bill, in order to be upfront with the Australian public about where we stand. This report to the Australian people will include progress being made towards international developments on climate and climate change policy and the effectiveness of the Commonwealth climate change policies in contributing to the achievement of targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is showing the rest of this parliament the way forward. It's an opportunity for the parliament to come together and chart a new path—how we can lower emissions, hit targets and create good jobs in the process. We're doing this practically, in order to ensure stability and certainty for Australians and Australian businesses. By listening to the science and by acting on climate change, we can create new jobs, and we intend to. We can enter a new era of Australian manufacturing. We can make things right here. Our future energy needs—batteries, wind turbines, new technology—these are things that we should make right here in Australia. They should be made in regional Australia. Australians will do that work very proudly. They will be able to build their lives on those good, secure jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm so proud of this government. I'm proud to be the Special Envoy for the Great Barrier Reef. I'm proud that one day, when my daughter is old enough to understand, I can tell her that I was part of a government that made this change. My daughter's backyard is the Great Barrier Reef. It's full of life and it is beautiful. We know that it is important to stand up today and say, 'Enough is enough.' This government has ensured that she and the Great Barrier Reef have a future. I really want to thank those in this place who have been part of this constructive process, because for our government this legislation is so important. There's a reason it was one of the first pieces of legislation we introduced. We want Australians and the rest of the world to know that we mean business. We will be the government that shapes the future for the better. We will be the government that delivers action on climate change. The former government continued to put their heads in the sand and tell regional Australians that nothing needed to change. Well, regional Australians want action on climate change. They want the climate wars to end. They want to see jobs, cleaner energy and cheaper energy, and they want to protect the Great Barrier Reef. So I implore senators to support this bill today. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of t</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">he Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:47</span>):  The Climate Change Bill 2022 is totally out of step with the rest of the world. It will do nothing to help the global environment. It will only increase living-cost pressures for Australians. It will cost us jobs in this country and it will continue the total scam that is carbon trading around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to start today with a conversation that I had recently with a mayor in western Queensland, the mayor of the Paroo shire, which surrounds the great country town of Cunnamulla in western Queensland. At the moment, thanks to the scam that is carbon trading, 40 per cent of properties in the Paroo shire have been destocked—cattle taken off the land—for the purposes of creating this ridiculous paper of carbon credits. It does nothing for the planet. The farmers are happy. They make money. The investment banks come up from Sydney and buy the properties. The farmers can go and retire on the coast if they like. They get paid. It's the tyre mechanics, the cafe owners and the hotel owners in towns like Cunnamulla who pay the bill because, when you get rid of all the cattle around Cunnamulla—Cunnamulla is only a small town—there are no fencing contractors coming to town anymore, there are no stock camps coming in at the end of their muster to have a drink. All of that business is lost from Cunnamulla. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What happens with this? What do we do? What do we get from destocking 40 per cent of the properties in Cunnamulla? The mayor was telling me that you go down a road there, and there are 12 pastoral properties on this road—big properties, big road—and nine of them are totally destocked. There are just three of the 12 now with cattle on them. This is the front line of the climate battle that doesn't get reported on down here. The victims of this are the small country businesses that are told, 'Your way of life, your lifestyle, is no more'—and it doesn't do anything for the environment. Do you know what happens to these properties when the cattle go? Weeds come in, pests come in, pigs come in. Come and have a look sometime. It's a total environmental disaster because there's no-one left to manage it. These investment banks in Sydney don't come and manage the property. They don't come and take out the pigs. They don't come and manage the weeds. You know what they're doing? They're collecting their cheques on the carbon credits. They're clipping that bill and making a lot of money, a lot of bonuses, off this scam that is carbon credits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You've always got to look at any of this sort of legislation. When things go through this place and we debate these things, you've got to ask the question—the Latin phrase is 'cui bono': who benefits? Who benefits from this legislation? It's not going to be the environment. It's not going to be the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef is doing fine; coral is at a record level. It is going to be the bankers who run these scams of carbon credits and carbon-trading schemes. That's why the banks all support it. That's why the banks love this. They're all in favour of all this because it's another line of business to get them more bonuses, to buy that other house, to extend the butler's pantry in the kitchen. That's why they want this legislation. It doesn't do anything for the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're totally out of step with the world now. I hear these conversations here in this building about how the world is waiting with bated breath for our parliament to put in this 43 per cent target ahead of the European winter. Is anyone watching the news? Has anyone in this place turned on a TV? The Greens party in Germany has reopened 21 coal-fired power stations this year—21. The Greens party in Germany are in government with the Socialist party and, I think, with a libertarian-type party. And the energy minister there, Mr Habeck—he's a Greens party politician—has been responsible for reopening 21 coal-fired power stations. We've only got 19 in Australia, but they're opening more coal-fired power stations in Germany than we have.</span>

                    </a>  That's right! I'll take that, Senator Antic: he's a hero! He's a hero, this Greens minister. He's trying to provide energy to his people; that's what he's prioritising—just as the new Prime Minister in the United Kingdom, Liz Truss, is doing when she says she's looking to overturn the ban on fracking in the UK. That's happening in the UK. If you turn on the news at the moment, that's what's happening in the world. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you turn on the news at the moment, China has announced plans to expand its coalmining by 300 million tonnes a year. India are looking at boosting their coalmining by 400 million tons a year. We only produce about 450 million tonnes of coal a year in this country. Together, those two countries alone are looking at increasing their coalmining by more than we produce in any one year. Why are they doing that? Because they're worried about where the energy of the world is coming from. They're worried about the cost of living. People are on the streets, all around the world, protesting the fact that they can't afford their energy bills anymore because of this insane net-zero agenda driven by a Swedish teenager. We are taking advice on our energy system from schoolchildren who strike because they want a day off school. I wanted days off school when I was a kid, but I don't think I should ever have been put in charge of the energy policy settings of the world. But that's what we're doing! And the consequences are there for all to see.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been very much against this agenda. I think it's a little bit strange that we should seek to fundamentally transform the way we make energy and food, in a generation, without thinking a bit about it. And I'm the radical, I'm the extremist, in this debate. So let's just take a temperature check of where we are. The mainstream position in Australia, in polite society in Western countries, is that we should fundamentally transform how food and energy is made within 30 years, within a generation—without the technologies around. We don't have a lot of the technologies that people want, this green steel and fertilisers not made from natural gas—look how that worked out for Sri Lanka. That stuff doesn't exist, and we are playing with fire here, because, as you can already see, in Sri Lanka and Europe they are struggling to feed and warm their own people because they are not taking proper advice about how things are. They do not understand how the world works, really. They don't understand how food is grown, how steel is made and how we manufacture things in the world. They just flick a switch and things happen. So the flick-a-switch generation—who think you just push a button and things turn up; you go on an app and your food arrives in an Uber; you set your thermostat and everything is fine—have no idea how coal is mined or how a blast furnace works in a steel mill. They've never been to these places, and that's why we've ended up in the situation we are in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The funny thing about this particular bit of legislation—and it continues this agenda which is enormously damaging for the world and is causing enormous pain right around in the world—is that it doesn't do all that much, at least in the primary bill we're debating. All this legislation does—for all the high rhetoric we've heard from the Labor Party about how they're saving the planet and the oceans are breathing again and all this rubbish—is say, 'Okay, our nationally determined commitment to Paris is this'—in this bill; it's a very short bill—'43 per cent is now our target, as is net zero by 2050.' We don't need legislation for that. They don't need this bill. And the government has admitted this; the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has admitted that they don't need legislation to enshrine our Paris Agreement targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, what are we doing? People are struggling to pay their bills in this country. Interest rates are going up. And we're wasting all this time on a piece of legislation that is unnecessary. We do not need to do this. We could be doing other things for the Australian people with our time here and the Labor government could still enshrine those Paris targets, without this legislation. Some may argue that this locks in the Paris targets for any future government—if the Australian people dare vote in the future for a government that wants to change our Paris commitments!—that they're trying to lock us in; they're trying to deny future Australians that agency. But even then, who cares? The Paris Agreement doesn't have any penalties. None of this actually binds. If a future Australian government does not meet 43 per cent emissions by 2030, guess what happens? Nothing happens. There are no penalties. You do not get kicked out of any kind of club.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can see that because the rest of the world is ignoring these things. As I said, Germany is opening up coal plants. Asia is opening up coalmines. Everyone has and is ignoring these climate agreements—except ourselves. We met the Kyoto target, and I think New Zealand did, too—I think one other country. No other country did. And we are imposing these costs on our people, denying our country our job opportunities, and the rest of the world is having a big laugh. I mean, Xi Jinping didn't even bother turning up at the Glasgow conference. Neither did Vladimir Putin. I think both of them were just too busy laughing! They wouldn't have been able to hold a straight face at Glasgow if they'd turned up, because the other countries of the world were happy to commit economic suicide to make it harder to, as I said, feed, clothe and warm their people, while China and Russia could go on their merry way. Does anybody in this place believe it? Actually, some people do; some people seem to think that because China is committed to net zero emissions by 2060 they're going to somehow meet that. How stupid can we be, to believe a Chinese communist dictator, to take what he says at face value? I mean, they might say something and do something different. That might happen—and it is happening. That's all the evidence we see.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some parts of this legislation that I do want to highlight that are risky. Most of it is completely innocuous and doesn't really make a difference to the world. However, in this legislation the government is also enshrining the climate objectives and net zero emissions objectives into a bunch of Commonwealth agencies, like the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility and Export Finance Australia. This could have a big consequence, because it will deny job and other opportunities associated with investments in those spaces. More importantly, I worry that it's going to weaponise our courts, that it's going to weaponise our judicial system. We've seen this in the past, with the EPBC Act and other issues, where stuff that we thought was rather innocuous going through this place became a huge weapon in the hands of an activist judge seeking to expand what was actually enshrined in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen it with climate legislation overseas. Heathrow Airport has not been able to expand because of climate legislation in the United Kingdom—something that I don't think any, or many, of the members of the House of Commons realised at the time: that the legislation they proposed is now putting caps on the number of people arriving in London. It is hard to get into the place now because of that climate legislation. We've seen it in the Netherlands, where European Union nitrogen targets have led to this absurd rule where farmers have to reduce their production by 30 per cent. They've been asked to cull their cattle in the Netherlands. Those of us who do flick on the news—and as I said, not many people in this place seem to watch the news—can see that in the Netherlands right now there is a revolt of farmers, of a new farmers party that has been formed against this unilateral shutting down of the world's second largest exporter of agricultural goods in the Netherlands. It's an amazing thing, but that's sometimes the consequence of these kinds of targets that we don't understand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me back to where I started: the victims of this type of legislation. They're the people who shower after work rather than before work. They're the ones who are going to cop it with this legislation. Look at most of us who come into this building. I usually have a shower before work, and my colleagues thank me for that. But, if you're a farmer or you're working in a steel mill or, definitely, if you're working in a coalmine, you'll have to shower after work because you'll be smelly and dirty because you've been working outside. Maybe you'll shower before work, but you'll have to shower after work. Those are the people that we see on the tractors in the Netherlands that are going to cop it from our naive changes that we have not thought through to the way food and energy is made in Western countries. Then those people will typically be the ones we ask to go and fight wars and other conflicts that will arise from this, as we see in Ukraine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a straight line between the naive environmental net-zero targets that Europe has adopted and the extra strength and leverage that that has given to Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine. Putin has got a lot more ability to pressure Europe and to take a risky decision to invade another country because he's not scared of Europe. He is not scared of those countries because they rely on him for their gas. They have totally removed their own independence and sovereignty and have become vulnerable to aggression and to the bullies that do exist around the world. It's news to the Greens and their naive followers in the Australian Labor Party: there are people who wish to do us harm in this world. There are countries that don't necessarily want to see Western, free and democratic nations prosper and grow, and we are playing into their hands by unilaterally reducing our economic strength, our industry and our capability to grow and manufacture the things that an industrial economy needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The primary reason I'm against these radical changes is that I do not trust the Chinese Communist Party. I do not trust them. I do not trust what they say. I do not trust their relations with other countries. We cannot afford to continue to export our jobs and our manufacturing industries—our commanding heights of our economy—to a country that we cannot trust. China is not a place that you can do business in at the moment. You can't; people can't even travel there from this country. But they are the world's largest emitter of carbon by far, and that is growing because the Western world continues to rely on them for cheap goods and subsidised materials, and we're doing nothing about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation only entrenches that trend. It only makes it harder for us to walk away from that dependent state we are sleepwalking into. We should oppose it because we should be putting this country first. We should be making our own energy again and we should be ensuring that those people who work hard for us have a great job and a good future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="256136" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVID POCOCK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:02</span>):  I'd like to start by thanking Senator Canavan. I really appreciate how much he stands up for communities who have relied on fossil fuels for generations in terms of workforce. It is going to be a really important part of this transition to actually look after those communities. It's actually a huge opportunity for regional areas if we get this right. That starts with actually having some certainty after a decade of uncertainty, inaction and delay. To actually have the big picture settings that say, 'We're heading in this direction,' will allow that transition to happen. It will allow us to actually look after regional areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to touch on a few of the things that Senator Canavan mentioned, most of which I disagree with, and that's the beauty of this place. He, rightly, talked about the cost of living. We are in a cost-of-living crisis around the country. The economics of climate action have changed so fast that I understand that some people in this place may still be relying on old figures. This continues to change. We're now in a position where electrification offers households savings of thousands of dollars a year if we get this right. We've seen it done with rooftop solar, started by the Howard government. We now have some of the cheapest rooftop solar in the world. Many people across the country are benefiting from this. We can do the same thing with batteries, heat pumps and electric vehicles, and unlock real savings—not just a one-off discount or fuel excise cut, but thousands of dollars every year going forward for everyday Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another comparison Senator Canavan made which I disagree with was comparing us to Europe. Europe buy a lot of gas from Russia. We don't buy any gas from Russia, yet we're subjected to international prices for gas because members of both major parties have allowed gas companies to charge us export prices for our own gas. That's a real failure of legislation, and I think it really speaks to just how much influence the gas companies have. At a time when they are making up to 500 per cent more profit, just the thought of actually recouping some of that to invest into our regions doesn't seem to be on the table.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last thing I'd like to respond to is Senator Canavan's concerns about the judicial system and litigation. This is already happening. Tiwi Islanders are currently in court against Santos about a gas project that is trying to access some of Australia's dirtiest gas from their homelands. The Gamilaraay people in Narrabri are also taking Santos to court about their proposed Pilliga project, and the former government was taken to court by young people in Australia who said that the government has a duty of care to actually protect young people and their futures. This is really what climate action is about, and this bill is a start to get us on the right track.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that human influence on the climate system is now an established fact. Our greenhouse gas emissions are warming the planet, and the results are disastrous. Just turn on the news: more intense floods, fires, cyclones and heatwaves, and warming and rising oceans. Climate change is the greatest challenge we face. It will affect all the people and places we know and love.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our communities around the country are demanding action—action from each other, action from corporate Australia and action from government. Jurisdictions from the UK to New Zealand have adopted climate laws that give a framework for climate action. Some Australian states and territories have done the same. The ACT, which I proudly represent, passed a climate act in 2010. Victoria passed a similar act with broader functions and powers in 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As with so many aspects of climate change policy, after a decade of inaction the Commonwealth lags woefully behind. There are more than 80 pieces of legislation relating to energy and various elements of climate policy. The sum of these parts is not an effective framework. A more complete and ambitious climate law would provide this framework. It would include guiding principles, adaptation action plans and an emissions budgeting framework. This bill, the Climate Change Bill 2022, has none of those.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What it does is perform two key functions. First, it sets two targets: 43 per cent by 2030 and net zero by 2050. Second, it provides an accountability framework for climate policy. The science on the target is clear: 43 per cent by 2030 is not enough. Scientists like former Chief Scientist Professor Penny Sackett and eminent climate professor David Karoly are unequivocal. According to Professor Karoly, the emissions reduction target is too weak to represent Australia's fair share of global emissions reductions needed to meet the Paris Agreement target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees. I'd like to thank the many eminent Canberrans who have been pushing for action: Professor Frank Jotzo, Professor Mark Howden, Professor Will Steffen, Professor Nerilie Abram, Professor Colin Butler, Dr Arnagretta Hunter and many others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We clearly have a moral obligation to act on climate change. As a wealthy country, doing the bare minimum does not cut it. We can and should be going harder and leading the world. We stand to lose so much from inaction: the incredible Great Barrier Reef, many of our beaches, heat-sensitive species like the greater glider, and an uninterrupted summer of cricket, to name just a few. Yet we stand to gain so much from bold climate action. We can build a better future—a livable future—and an economy for the future. We can protect and conserve so much of what makes this nation great.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the new Labor government have been explicit that 43 per cent is as high as they're willing to go. While I'd like to see more ambition, climate scientists would like to see more ambition and I think millions of Australians would like to see more ambition, 43 per cent is certainly an improvement on where we were 12 months ago, and legislating a target is a significant step forward. This target will provide certainty to encourage the large-scale investment that will be needed in the transition to renewable energy. This is a development the community supports. After more than a decade of climate wars, we need to get some gains and move from the 'what' to the 'how'. Perfect should not be the enemy of the good. So, if the government is unwilling to be more ambitious, I support the legislated targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Outside of the targets, I call on the government to support my amendments to improve the accountability and transparency mechanisms within this bill. The bill has three primary accountability and transparency mechanisms: first, the annual statement on climate change from the minister; second, publicly available advice from the Climate Change Authority on that statement; and, third, publicly available advice from the Climate Change Authority on updated emissions reduction targets. Each of those mechanisms should be strengthened, and I will move amendments to do just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Accountability and transparency on climate action is so important, particularly in the context of Australian climate policy. We don't have a carbon price. We don't have a cap-and-trade system. We have a set of overlapping and complex policies that provide a mesh of incentives and penalties. All of this complexity makes inaction and damage easy to hide, or to dress up as action, as we have seen in the past. Without accountability and transparency, it will be hard to identify and measure the impact and effectiveness of policies. Without transparency, we are putting our climate and our future behind an opaque window.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Beside that window, while we debate this 43 per cent in both the lower house and Senate, another government minister is spruiking the opening of 46,000 square kilometres of new offshore oil and gas exploration; fossil fuel subsidies remain, at the same time that we are seeing fossil fuel companies making extraordinary profits; and, at the same time, we are hearing that the cost of actually helping everyday Australians is too much for the government to consider. We have seen climate-wrecking projects like Beetaloo and Scarborough stay in the pipeline. Thousands of carbon credits with questionable integrity continue to be issued. This attitude of 'just trust us; we'll get there' is not good enough, and Australians are demanding better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe we should know what impact federal budget measures will have on our emissions reduction targets. We should know how much of the targets are to be achieved by different sectors of the economy. We should know how developments in climate science are influencing climate policies and targets. If science is not being followed, we should be told why not. Science is referred to just once in this bill. By contrast, it appears seven times in the UK equivalent. We should know whether Australia's emissions reduction targets represent our fair share of the reductions needed, and, if they don't, why they don't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't have to look far to see our Pacific island neighbours crying out for climate action. For many of them, this is an existential threat. They risk losing their homes, and they are crying out for more action but also leadership from their neighbours. Australia has a moral obligation to act on climate change. We are, relatively speaking, an extraordinarily wealthy country. With that comes responsibility to lead—not just do the bare minimum, as we are seeing in this bill, but actually step it up. So, while this is an important symbolic move, getting back to the table, let's not pat ourselves on the back too much about this bill. It's a first step. There's so much more to be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With climate policy, everything has to be looked at through the lens of integrity, because a target without integrity is just a number. It's not going to matter, and future generations will judge us harshly for our inaction and for some of the ridiculous arguments that we've used to avoid acting on what is the biggest challenge humans have ever faced. We have to act. We have to act decisively. I support this bill, and I look forward to working with my colleagues here in the Senate to ensure that this is just the first step not only in ending the climate wars but in winning them and going from being, when it comes to climate action, an embarrassing laggard who turns up to international summits to talk about climate action, spruiks gas companies and tries to water down agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Countries that have hardly contributed at all to climate change are paying a massive price. When you turn on the television, you can watch what's happening in Pakistan. You see some of the famines happening in Africa. We know the awful consequences, not only to human life but to ecosystems around the world, with unchecked climate change. We're starting to get a glimpse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What happens next is up to us. We can act decisively. We can be part of actually building a better future together. We can lead in the global community. We've heard concerns raised by Senator Canavan about what countries like China are doing. We should be out there demanding more action from the international community. It's clear that developed countries need to lead this. It's a huge opportunity for us here in Australia, in terms not only of our economy—building an economy for the future and unlocking energy savings for households—and having a cleaner environment in our cities but also of then being part of exporting that intellectual property and those ideas around the world as everyone has this transition. It's happening. It's going to happen whether we like it or not. The speed at which it happens is up to us. What an incredible opportunity to be part of! We stand here as one of the first generations to know the scope of this issue, this problem, and one of the last to actually be able to act.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  It's been a long nine years in energy policy in this country, with many policies from the former coalition government failing to stabilise our energy market, lower energy prices, address climate change or invest in renewable energy jobs. What Australia really needed was an energy target. The National Party wouldn't let the Liberal Party set one. What Australia needed was courage and leadership, but we were left bereft of both. 'Let chaos reign in energy policy,' was the former government's mantra. There was no substantive policy or mechanism to get our country on track in this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the May election, Australians were rightly tired of sideshows and slogans from the former government. They were tired of delay. They were tired of lack of action. The people of Australia were heard loud and clear. They threw the former government out of this place and the other place because it did not represent their communities when it came to energy and climate change policy. They threw out the sceptics, the deniers and the enablers of delay on climate policy. Our country's mission has always been to lead, not to follow in the wake of other countries. Investing in a renewable future is a move away from the old adage of the Liberals and Nationals, who are the great believers in denial. It is a move away from almost total reliance on fossil fuels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen over the last decade the power of our climate—fires, floods, cyclones and droughts. These are deadly acts of nature which have the power to break families and cripple them into uncertainty. Climate change may be the world's most significant hurdle to leap over, but it is in fact Australia's biggest economic opportunity. We must grasp that opportunity with both hands. We are one of the most successful social democratic countries in the world because we have risen to the occasion time and time again to overcome adversity. When regional Australia is struggling with drought or flood, our cities respond. We are one country regardless of where you live, and climate change at its worst will affect us all. When climate events strike, they not only damage our natural environment; they can displace individuals and families. They can have catastrophic effects on the price of goods. Food shortages push prices up, and we have witnessed this in supermarkets across the country as the cost of living increases.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We invest, we innovate and we collaborate for positive change, and that is how the Albanese government has been approaching energy policy in this country during the 47th Parliament. We know Australians are amongst some of the best innovators in the world. Professor Martin Green and his colleagues at the University of New South Wales invented the modern efficient solar panel as we know it. That is the Australian way. It is innovation and collaboration, not delay and division. That is what we must celebrate, and when we celebrate innovation and invest in it we move our country forward. Investing in innovation means supporting ARENA, the CEFC, the CSIRO and our universities to do what they do best.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An Albanese Labor government is committed to progress on all fronts where our energy policy priorities are concerned. We must embrace technology and learn from global initiatives in the private and public sectors. We must understand the opportunities that science and renewable energy provide for our country and for rural Australia in particular. Our country has the space for renewable energy. Solar farms are possible on a large scale. We have the space and skills to make energy cleaner and cheaper. With the correct framework of investment, with a government that takes full advantage of the opportunities, we can make and export energy well into the future. We must back the private sector—companies like LINE Hydrogen and Firmus Tasmania, who are leaders in the energy and storage space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own state of Tasmania, during the federal election campaign Anthony Albanese, Chris Bowen and the Labor team announced $70 million in funding to start the production of hydrogen at Bell Bay in northern Tasmania, supporting local jobs and renewable energy. Labor also announced $5 million to ensure LINE Hydrogen will invest in green hydrogen production and co-locate with solar farms to replace Tasmanian diesel trucks and buses. The first stage of the project is set to include hydrogen production, and up to 30 trucks and buses will be leased to industry partners. Over time, LINE could also build at least five hydrogen refuelling stations across Tasmania. The project will create 215 direct and downstream jobs: 135 direct jobs and 80 downstream jobs.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am so proud of these commitments and will be working hard with Minister Bowen and Prime Minister Albanese to secure a renewable future in Tasmania and right across the country. Only today, it was reported in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Examiner</span> that Countrywide Hydrogen has signed an agreement with a German company, Wirsol, to pursue solar-to-hydrogen opportunities together in Australia. We once again see Tasmania leading in renewables and leading in the energy market.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people deserve so much more than a government that has tried to abolish the Renewable Energy Target at every opportunity. We heard the contribution this morning from Senator Canavan. This is why, in the first weeks of the Albanese Labor government, we committed to reduce emissions in this country by 43 per cent by 2030. This is what courage and leadership looks like: ending the climate wars and looking to a more hopeful and promising future. The Australian government has been left behind for too long while the private sector in this country has been leading the way on a renewable energy future. The Business Council of Australia knows that the Australian government must build a framework that the private sector can follow. This will allow business to invest in new technology, and they can do that without an emission target.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The global momentum for renewables due to decarbonisation is now unstoppable. Governments, markets and communities must work together to this end. This is what this bill, the Climate Change Bill 2022, and related legislation will achieve. This bill will put Australia on track for net zero by 2050. No ifs and buts; it will happen. Our Powering Australia plan, which we took to the election, will deliver 604,000 jobs across the country and bring on 82 per cent renewables by 2030. While legislation is not essential to deliver Powering Australia, the Albanese government regards enshrining our national, determined contribution in law as best practice. This bill will proudly bring Australia into line with countries, such as France, Denmark and Spain, which have legislated net zero targets by 2050. Countries such as Canada have also legislated their 2030 targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the bill will restore transparency and accountability on government action on climate change and confirm the important role of independent expert advice. I note that periodic, independent reviews of the operations of the bill will ensure legislation remains fit for purpose, as the international response to climate change evolves and Australia proceeds towards net zero. The bill will also ensure our commitments under the Paris Agreement of holding the increase in global temperature to well below two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Pursuing efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5 Celsius above preindustrial levels are reflected in the objects of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia cannot lead the world in a clean energy future. The opportunities of renewable energy and renewable jobs are boundless. We live in one of the most extraordinary natural environments that can harshness the energy production of the sun, water and wind. I know too well, from my lived experience in Tasmania, that 100 per cent renewables is possible. Our energy mix in Australia must change, and the time for delay is well and truly over.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We took to the election a 43 per cent target. That is what the Australian people voted for. This place needs to support Labor in government getting on with our better future plan. We will deliver for the Australian people. I commend this bill, and I encourage my Senate colleagues to vote in support of the future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="283601" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator VAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:28</span>):  Without a doubt, the transition to net zero is inevitable. However, this legislation, the Climate Change Bill 2022 and related bill, is unnecessary and unachievable. The world is moving towards producing carbon neutral energy, and this is a good thing. The globe will at some point in time reach net zero, and I would say ideally sooner rather than later. However, given the Paris accords rules, Australia already cannot walk back our NDC for 2030, even if anyone actually wanted to, and the government knows this. So the bill before us today is a redundant piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, with the solutions we have today, according to some of the best scientific minds, the target of 43 per cent today is not achievable. The mechanisms to achieve this will cost the taxpayers billions, and the government have not shown us how this will be achieved. Australians understand that the sooner you want something built the more it costs. Lowering emissions is not just a slogan but also a massive, integrated effort encompassing the entire economy that needs to be built. The Labor government would like to say that they are ambitious with their emissions reduction target of 43 per cent. This bill before us today reflects their decision to lock Australia into this commitment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Personally, I am more ambitious than those opposite as to what I would like to see our emissions reduction target be. However, I am not blind to reality, unlike those opposite. I believe we need to be as pragmatic as we are ambitious. The Paris accord allows us to update our targets when we know we can meet them, and I believe that this is the approach Australia must take. Yes, I too believe that renewables are part of the future, but while planning for the future we must also concern ourselves with the present. It does no good to small-business owners, Australian manufacturers, the elderly and those struggling to keep the lights on if all we have is a plan to increase renewable energy in the future but no plan for how we're going to keep the lights on today at an affordable price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us not forget that, when Labor first announced, in December 2021, their plan to legislate a 2030 target, the now Prime Minister stated, 'Labor's plan is to create jobs, cut power bills and reduce emissions.' He pitched to the Australian people not one but two targets backed by:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the most comprehensive modelling ever done for any policy by any opposition in Australia's history since Federation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Albanese said that their policies:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… will see electricity prices fall from the current level by $275 for households by 2025, at the end of our first term if we are successful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've now seen the government already walk back on that promise, not at the end of their first term but after 110 days or thereabouts. In fact, those opposite have been so fearful about the promise to reduce power bills by $275 that they won't even utter those numbers anymore, because while those opposite sat in opposition they had the ability to grandstand and talk about emissions reduction without giving a single thought to energy supply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, those with any sense know that you cannot talk about emissions reduction without also talking about supply of reliable energy. These two factors are intrinsically linked. It's called physics. As stated by the International Energy Agency, 'The world is experiencing the first truly global energy crisis in history.' Yes, in large part this is because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and I'll have more to say on that later today. However, it highlights what should be a bleedingly obvious point: there are and always will be unexpected outcomes and events. If the last three years have taught us anything, it is that we really do not know what the future holds and that we can only be prepared for the future by ensuring we are protected against a whole range of scenarios. This means ensuring we have a secure, reliable supply of energy. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has highlighted how running into this transition with your eyes closed will only end in tragedy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The country of Germany stands as a stark reminder of this. It has spent more than US$743 billion transitioning its electricity system, boosting wind and solar to more than 45 per cent of generation since 2000. And, as we have heard during Environment and Communications Legislation Committee hearings since this bill was introduced, even after spending all this money on renewable energy, they are struggling to get to the target of producing energy below 300 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour. In fact, Germany now has Europe's most expensive retail power and cannot function without imported Russian gas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In June, Germany announced it would be restarting some of its coal plants due to the shortages of gas due to the Ukrainian war. What is more surprising is that this announcement came from the German Green Party's finance minister. However, it should not be a surprise that, when faced with complete and utter economic failure due to the inability to create power, even the greens in Germany seem to make some sense. Mind you, the German greens have a far better hold on reality when it comes to national security than those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">JP Morgan's <span style="font-style:italic;">2022</span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nnual </span><span style="font-style:italic;">energy paper</span> explicitly states:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… countries that reduce production of fossil fuels under the assumption that renewables can quickly replace them face substantial economic and geopolitical risks—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">as Europe currently shows us. If the energy transition is to succeed, we cannot disconnect the generation methods we currently have before we have a replacement for them. Europe severely miscalculated, and they are now paying the price for it, with a likely recession, a lower rate of growth, a decline in competitiveness of exported energy-intensive goods, higher food prices and domestic political tensions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to remind everyone that anyone who starts talking about renewables without first talking about firming does not know what they are talking about. And if they start talking about batteries as the answer to firming, then they doubly do not know what they are talking about. We've heard those in Labor and the Greens say that the solution to firming is batteries. Currently, batteries are not actually fit for grid-scale storage to address our emissions reduction and are unlikely to be before 2030. The outlook on when or if these will ever be available is uncertain. However, Australia is a key producer of critical minerals for batteries, and I do believe we can play an important role in processing those minerals, the manufacturing of batteries and the exportation of those batteries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party are correct when they state that renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy, but they're only correct in very small part. Again, as JP Morgan's energy paper stated, putting more renewable energy on the grid will not guarantee lower prices, because energy prices rest on an average cost of generation, not just the actual cost of a power source that can deliver energy on a continuous basis unsupported. As AEMO's <span style="font-style:italic;">2022 </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Integrated System Plan</span> states, we need to treble the firming capacity from dispatchable storage, including pumped hydro and gas fired generation, to firm renewables that are coming onto the grid. As I've said before, we do not have batteries on the grid to firm the power supply as it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's policy to fund 400 community batteries of about the size of 500 kilowatt hours is simply inadequate and does not constitute a virtual power plant, or VPP. CSIRO data found that Victorian households use an average of 22 kilowatt hours between sunset and sunrise each night in winter. In this situation, a 500-kilowatt-hour battery could provide sufficient overnight power for only 23 households. This is the equivalent of needing one on every street, not in each suburb, as Labor plans. Assuming a nightly load of 22 kilowatt hours, it would take over 80,000 batteries to meet the power consumption needs of Melbourne's 1.8 million households. Even if the 400 proposed batteries were all built in Victoria, they would only meet 0.5 per cent of the city's winter night-time demand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other hand, Snowy 2.0 has a capacity of 350 million kilowatt hours, with a capacity to meet Melbourne's nightly demand for over a week. Labor suggest that they can source batteries at $500,000 each, which equates to $1,000 per kilowatt hour. The Snowy 2.0, costing $4.5 billion for the 350 megawatt hours, comes out to only 12.9c per kilowatt hour. It's far more sensible, I would suggest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are currently viable firming technologies, such as hydro and gas—which we invested in when we were in government—as well as viable future technologies, such as green hydrogen and CCS. Furthermore, a clean and reliable source of firming our grid is through nuclear technology, which is established in over 30 countries and produces electricity with very, very low carbon emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Climate Change and Energy's calling nuclear energy the 'slowest' and 'most expensive' form of alternate energy is simply wrong. As we heard in the Senate hearings into this bill, the CSIRO is quoting costs for large third-generation nuclear power plants—which have a high variability in cost in the first place—not the small modular reactors that are currently being built in other countries. So we could look to them as the alternative, not the old, big, third-generation plants. While it is true that the costs of technologies such as wind and solar are lower when the wind is blowing and the sun is shining, when you add in the cost of transmission lines and storage, backup or other firming methods, the levelised cost is actually much higher, and evidence of that was given to the committee and shows that the cost of the renewable system is about 80 per cent higher than if we use nuclear. We only have to look at France, with about 65 to 70 per cent of its electricity generated from nuclear. Their carbon footprint is less than 50 grams per kilowatt hour, compared to Germany, who are struggling to produce energy below 300 grams of CO2 per kilowatt hour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If energy transition is to succeed, we have to build firming sources like the Snowy Corporation is with 2.0 and Kurri Kurri or we have to keep coal-fired generation and other gas generation until the end of its natural life or fix the ones that are broken. It also means that we have to release more of our natural gas resources and invest in things such as blue and green hydrogen. The ACCC gas inquiry report specifically states that, to address the projected shortfall of gas in 2023 as per the AEMO <span style="font-style:italic;">GSOO</span>, significant additional volumes of gas will need to be produced. I don't see how the government can stick to their promise of reducing power bills if they do not specifically support the additional production of gas, particularly in my home state of Victoria. This lack of support is hurting Australians already, with the report highlighting that users are now receiving offers at higher prices with less flexibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the start of my speech, I want to see the world transition and move to net zero as quickly as possible. However, as nations such as Germany are finding out, rushing in with your arms wide open and your eyes closed shut will only lead to pain, insecurity, instability and higher power prices. The government must start talking about how they are going to address these issues before they hurt Australians even more, as this bill will.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  It was during my second week here as a senator, in July 2014, that the Abbott government scrapped the price on carbon and began the long years of federal government inaction on climate that Australia suffered through until the election in May this year. It has been such a long eight years. My actual first speech in this place, the 'This is not my first speech' first speech, was to speak to the bill that scrapped the price on carbon, and I talked about the science of the impacts of climate change:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… overall increasing global temperatures, increasing climate variability, increasing rainfall variability, increasing extreme weather events, increasing sea surface temperatures, sea level rise, increasing acidification of our oceans, and the melting of glaciers and the ice caps.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Eight years on this is our reality. I talked about the costs of climate change, particularly the cost of bushfires:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… their increased frequency and severity, and their increased spread across the country and across the year, beginning earlier and continuing later. Think of the likely loss of life that will occur, and the personal losses, the personal costs, and the public costs of dealing with increased bushfires. Victoria's Black Saturday bushfires of February 2009 cost the community more than $4 billion … and this does not include the health and social costs and the flow-on costs to business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, think about that in the context of our Black Summer fires that we experienced over the summer of 2019-20, where the cost to agriculture alone was $5 billion and the estimate of the cost to restore the bushland which was lost is a staggering $73 billion a year for 30 years. I talked in that speech about the impact on people:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I spoke this week to a young woman whose family has a vineyard in South Australia. Her father is despairing. He does not have any superannuation. His whole wealth is based on his vineyard. He can see the value of his vineyard evaporating before his eyes, every year, when the quality of his grape crop crashes because of extreme summer heat or when it is affected by smoke taint from bushfires occurring where bushfires just have not occurred before. She is advising him to sell up now, before it is worth absolutely nothing. He is reluctant, but he is depressed and despairing. This is the cost of climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Eight years on, I wonder how this young woman and her father are getting on, so you can imagine, after eight long years, how relieved I am to be speaking to a bill to set a target to reduce our carbon pollution and to have hope that this will be the government that begins to take the climate crisis seriously. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You will note, however, I am still talking in the future tense and I am only talking of hope, not optimism, because this bill is just a beginning. It is just a first step. Let me quote a scientific analysis of what a 43 per cent emissions reduction target means, written by IPCC lead author Bill Hare from Climate Analytics:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ALP's 2030 target of a 43% emissions reduction is consistent with 2˚C of warming globally. Under this level of warming, if sustained, the Great Barrier Reef would very likely be destroyed, along with all other tropical reefs in Australia and elsewhere. At the global level the most extreme heat events could be about three times more frequent than in recent decades, and in Australia the highest maximum temperatures about 1.7˚C hotter. In other words, an intense heat event that might have occurred once in a decade in recent decades could occur about every three years and would be significantly hotter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need more ambition than that. This is not a safe climate. Surely we can do better than to count the death of the Great Barrier Reef on our watch. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing, we are feeling and we are being devastated by the impacts of 1.1 degrees of warming now. We see more than 1,300 people dead in Pakistan in recent weeks, with over a third of their country underwater due to an intense monsoon and melting glaciers—millions of people without food and homes. We had our own floods in Brisbane and northern New South Wales, where the reality of needing to rehome people away from high-flood-risk areas is only now hitting home, and massive wildfires across Europe and North America, following record heat in recent months. Of course, we had our own Black Summer, when two billion animals were killed. We have First Nations lands and people suffering from increased temperatures, degradation and destruction of cultural heritage and natural resources such as plants, grasses, timber and clean running water, which provide a basis for First Nations people to practise culture. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before 2002 there was just one megafire year in Australian records, in 1939. Since 2001 there have been three megafire years, when more than one million hectares of land has been burnt, including ancient Gondwana rainforests in Tasmania and Queensland which are just not adapted for fire. This is with 1.1 degrees of heating. Labor policy—what is in this bill, a 43 per cent target and continuing and expanding the mining, the burning and the export of coal and gas—has us headed for two degrees or more. As I said in my actual first speech:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have a duty of care to people and nature suffering and under threat from global warming. We do not have the right to turn a blind eye to the consequences of our dirty economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My agenda for my time here is clear. I want to be able to look my grandchildren in the eye and tell them that it was during my time in the Senate that Australia turned the corner and legislated to begin the shift to a zero-carbon safe climate economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And I had a few suggestions for what needed to happen to get us on our way: to set pollution reduction targets based on science; to stop subsidising fossil fuels; to create more jobs by boosting clean energy production and energy conservation; to start closing coal-fired power stations; to say no to new coal and gas; and to make the big polluters pay for the damage they are doing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, the climate denialism of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government over the last eight years means there has not been a lot of progress made on this agenda. The big progress—obviously, despite the government—has been how much of an increase in clean energy production there has actually been over the last eight years. The potential of renewable energy production in Australia is only just kicking off. It is massive. So, yes, we actually have been able to start closing coal-fired power stations, and more closures are on the cards. We need a plan, though, and a commitment for a just transition, managed by a transition authority so that workers and communities don't get shafted in the process. But the rest of the agenda that I set out? Fail. And is Labor planning to address it in this term of government? No. Fail, again. We have not yet turned the corner. I could not yet look any grandchildren-to-be in the eye. Do we have pollution reduction targets based on science? No. The science says we need a 75 per cent reduction in our carbon pollution by 2030 if we're going to keep below 1.5 degrees of warming and even more to reach the zero carbon that would actually achieve a safe climate. We haven't got a safe climate now. There is no carbon budget left. We need to be reducing our carbon emissions as quickly as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fossil fuel subsidies are still continuing—billions and billions of dollars that could be spent on encouraging clean energy production instead subsidising the mining and use of coal, gas and oil. And making the big polluters pay? Nope. That could be done through a price on carbon, such as was scrapped by Tony Abbott. And of course the big, lumbering, polluting elephant in the room is the new coal and gas: the Mount Pleasant coalmine expansion that's currently before the minister; the Beetaloo Basin fracking, which will be a carbon bomb, bigger than the Adani coalmine; Scarborough gas; the 114 new proposed coal and gas projects. Any government that was serious about addressing the climate crisis would have said an immediate no to these new projects upon taking office. At the very least, they need to commit to a climate trigger in our environment laws so that the damage these projects are going to do to our global climate is at least assessed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a final really incredibly important issue that I talked about in my first speech eight years ago, that I have championed ever since in this place and that is crucially relevant to the bill before us today, and that is protecting our forests—getting timber and woodchips from plantations, not native forests, and not burning forests in furnaces for energy. Now is the time to do this. The Senate committee that inquired into this bill heard stark evidence of how the burning of wood from native forests for energy can in no way be considered renewable. In fact, burning native forest wood for energy actually emits more carbon than burning coal. So I'm pleased that the Senate committee recommended reviewing the renewable energy status of wood from native forests and that the government has agreed to this recommendation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor rejected classifying the burning of wood from native forests as renewable energy in 2011 and 2015, so I recommend that they dust off their thinking from then and make this change as a critical part of protecting our forests. If they need any further prompting as to the importance of protecting our forests and the link with acting on climate, they should have a read of what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found in their sixth assessment report, released earlier this year, in which they said that the protection, improved management and restoration of forests and other ecosystems have the largest potential to reduce emissions and/or sequester carbon and that safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystems is fundamental to climate resilience development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our forests need to be protected for their own sake. They need to be protected because of the role they play in soaking and storing up carbon. They need to be protected as the traditional lands of our First Nations people, for their totems and songlines and for water for wildlife, and for their beauty—rather than burnt in forest furnaces for fake renewable energy under scam systems that undermine the integrity of real renewables.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, this legislation is a start; it's a beginning. But so much more needs to be done. I urge the government to work with us Greens to do the real work that's required for Australia to be playing our part in tackling the climate crisis.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  I am delighted to be in the chamber rising to speak in support of this climate change legislation. Finally, after a decade of inaction on climate change and energy policy, this chamber has an opportunity to start the work required to end the climate wars and to take serious and urgent action to address the crisis of climate change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the May election, the Australian people voted resoundingly in favour of action on climate change, and our government promised we would take it. We would do the work required to lower emissions while continuing to invest in communities, create jobs, improve energy security and make Australia a global leader on climate action instead of an embarrassment. Before us today is the draft legislation that gets this work underway. After a decade of denials, delays and chaos on renewables and energy, our bills, the Climate Change Bill 2022 and the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022 before us, these Labor bill, finally gives business, industry, energy investors and our wider community the certainty they so desperately need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through its 2030 target of 43 per cent, these bills puts Australia on track to meet net zero by 2050. But let's be clear: this is a minimum aspiration, not a cap on our aspiration. Together we can deliver better across our economy. Without this certainty, we will continue to miss the opportunities and economic benefits of the energy transformation before us. These bills are simple yet powerful, and I am proud of them. I have served for three years in this place, watching those on the other side squib and squander the opportunities of renewable energies before us and watching them duck their heads as the climate catastrophe unfolds around us. We have this opportunity to act now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been clear and indisputable that climate change poses an existential threat to Australia and the world. We have been in a climate crisis. With each passing year we see its dramatic impacts unfolding before our eyes. The CSIRO reports that consistent increases of temperatures in Australia, exacerbated by climate change, will lead to regular extreme heat events and increasingly severe drought conditions. We know climate change also exacerbates extreme weather events in Australia, causing more frequent and severe natural disasters, with the Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements finding that the bushfires and flooding which have decimated our country over recent years will increase in frequency and intensity as conditions worsen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people in my home state of South Australia know the dangers of these worsening disasters all too well. In the summer bushfires of 2019 and 2020, we watched parts of our state burn. We saw the loss of lives, the loss of livelihoods, the loss of wildlife—lives lost in those fires not just in our state but right across the country. We saw the unprecedented loss of wildlife at a scale which was just heartbreaking for everyone in our country. We know for our river, the lifeblood of my state, climate change places conditions under further stress and threatens the water supply which is so vital to our future. We are living through a climate emergency and we must act. These bills are an opportunity to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my first speech to the Senate I spoke about the importance of placing intergenerational fairness at the heart of the decisions we take in this place so as to leave our children a better world than the one we inherited. I spoke about how, for the first time in modern history, we weren't set to deliver that. This is one of the ways we do. Our parliament's failure to act consistently and effectively on climate change is a key way in which we are failing our younger Australians, because, although Australians are already feeling the impact of climate change, we know it is young Australians who are set to feel it disproportionately and to pay higher costs for longer. If we don't act, we leave them with a disaster. We leave our children, our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren with a catastrophe, environmentally, socially and economically.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we do not seize the opportunities which come from acting on climate change—the economic opportunities which will lead to better and greater jobs—we will betray these young South Australians, these young Australians, these generations to come. How can we in good conscience stand in this place and decide to ignore their future? We know this future is competing at a global scale. Other countries are acting. Other countries are skilling their workforces and preparing their economies to deal with this challenge and to reap the rewards of the opportunities presented in these new industries. If we don't do that, that is a huge betrayal of our young people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we cannot ignore the vulnerable populations across our globe who also feel this pain—this hardship—gravely and disproportionately to other places in the world. It's about being globally responsible. It's about being good global citizens in a world which is ever connected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is good environmental policy. It's good social policy. It's brilliant economic policy. And thank God it is a policy, after a decade of nothing. It has been a decade of wasted time, of wasted opportunities, of failing to provide that leadership and that indicator to the market of where to invest, of failing to do the things—the bare minimum things—we know we need to do to address this crisis and this catastrophe. These bills, the Climate Change Bill 2022 and Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022, give us, this parliament, an opportunity to end these stupid climate wars, to come out and be part of a global community that is taking action and to take the action which our business community expects of us, which our community expects of us and which our young people expect of us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are committed to ending these wars, and the other side of this chamber has an opportunity today to do so too. It has an opportunity to accept the mandate, to put that rubbish of the past decade behind us, to come together as a chamber, to act like grown-ups, to be responsible to the young people in our community and to be responsible to our environment and to our economy. It has that opportunity in this moment to give industry, businesses and our communities the security and the policy certainty that they are crying out for. That's what this legislation does. It provides some leadership from the federal government, which has been so lacking over the last decade and the lack of which is costing us environmentally, economically and socially.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After a decade of failing our nation on climate, supporting this legislation is the least that they could do. So I urge everyone in this chamber to take this moment, put the embarrassment of the years that came before behind us and show the Australian community that we're grown-ups, that we get the catastrophe that's before us, that we will take action together and that we heard the mandate that they gave us at the election.

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McDONALD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  I'm delighted to rise to speak on these bills, the Climate Change Bill 2022 and Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022, which truly must be one of the most poorly considered legislative positions taken in recent times, not because of its intention to reduce emissions—I think we all understand that we were on a pathway to emissions reductions under the previous government, and that will continue—but it is the speed of this legislation and the impact it will have on the very most vulnerable in our communities: families and regional people. Right across Australia, there will be an impact on investment and others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to fly the flag for people facing the terrible prospect of cutting their food budgets and power use thanks to this rushed and ill-considered push for legally enforceable emissions reductions. The energy minister, Minister Bowen, has already made the point that legislation was not required. Immediately upon forming government, the new government went to the UN and made the new emissions target. Yet we have charged ahead with legislation that is going to open the door to greater activist situations and lawfare, which will pull up projects that are critical to investment in and the development of this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Legislating emissions reduction targets is the hallmark of a government that doesn't trust its people. It reeks of a way of going about governance which sees high targets being set and people then being penalised, instead of innovation and technical change being incentivised, which was the pathway we were on before. I am nervous, particularly for the resources sector, a sector that we rely on for the great royalties and tax income. The money pays for us to have high environmental standards that allow us to see more women and Indigenous people going into mining companies in well-paid, purposeful, meaningful jobs. These are all things that are now threatened by this headlong rush into emissions reductions within too short a time frame.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been speaking to resources companies right across Australia, who are telling me that, particularly following AEMO's report last week, South Australia will be looking at further blackouts and that Victoria and New South Wales will suffer the same going forward over the next two years. But we already know we do not have suitable energy generation in this country. We know the investment in transmission lines that is required to bring online more renewable power, but we also know that we don't have the capacity to mine the critical minerals and rare earths that are required to build solar panels and wind farms within the time frame that this legislation is outlining. We actually can't do it. So mining and resources companies that have to make the decision about multibillion-dollar investments over the longer term are now looking at Queensland in particular but Australia more broadly and saying, 'Is this the place that we can trust to invest our dollars?' And there is a big question mark over that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We compete in the world. The Fraser Institute confidence survey that is done every year has seen Queensland specifically slip from 12th down to 18th for investor confidence and has seen the understanding of regulation and confidence in the state slip from third to 19th. These are appalling statistics. Western Australia, I am pleased to say, still sits at first. But already these companies are looking at the slowness of approvals and the subjective nature of approvals, and now they have had to add one more element: whether or not there is going to be adequate supply of power to run their projects. We know that they are now having to run the ruler over Australia as a destination and compare it to places like Canada, which has invested in pumped hydro and doesn't have the emissions reductions that are in line with some of the power generation in this country, so they will be considering investing in Canada, in South America, in the US and in South Africa. These are all places that are competing with Australia for investment dollars.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Investment dollars in Australia do a range of things. It isn't just the introduction of royalties. It isn't just the introduction of company taxes. It is also the personal PAYG taxes that are paid by those people employed by mining companies. It is not just miners and engineers; it is the chefs in the camps, the people right across the industry, who in that sector are receiving at least double the average wage in this country, and they won't be replaced. They won't be replaced by any other industry that we are considering. These companies train our young people. They give them well-paid careers in innovation and technology that we can then export around the world. Whether it is mine rehabilitation, environmental scientists or engineers, Australia leads the way in a range of sectors that are associated with our resources industry. We should be proud of that and should be encouraging that and doing everything we can to ensure that those investment dollars come to this nation rather than go to another jurisdiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we consider the tax income, we think about big companies. We think about the big industry leaders who invest in this nation, but we also have to remember the juniors, the explorers, the drillers. When you consider every project that talks about hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in investments, those dollars are spent on Australian based businesses that carry out the infrastructure. Whether it is building a new rail line or whether it is building roads or camps or supplying the food or the tyres, these dollars are all spent on Australian businesses that in turn pay their own tax and employ their own employees. The depth of the impact that this ill-thought-through and rushed legislation will have on such a critically important part of our economy and our nation, I think, is terrifying. We would do well to consider what it is that we are proposing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the dissenting report that was tabled by the coalition about this legislation we looked sincerely at the idea of how we can review the impact of the legislation. We would like the Productivity Commission, as the most logical, well-resourced and most focused group, to review the impact of this legislation as it would play out in Australia. It needs to be regular—at least five-yearly—and it needs particularly to understand the impact on regional Australia, which of course, is where most of these resource activities happen. It needs to understand the impact on energy generation. We have not talked at all about the requirement for new transmission lines to allow renewable projects to be hooked up to the grid. That requires new transmission lines. It requires more copper than we are currently mining, yet we are not seeing new copper projects being brought online in a speedy and fast manner. In fact, we heard from the Japanese ambassador several weeks ago and, more recently, last night at a Minerals Week function where he gave a speech which clearly outlined the undermining of confidence that Japanese companies, amongst others, now have and their uncertainty about continuing to invest in Australia, not just in coal but also in copper, hydrogen and rare earths. These are all critical investment decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a relatively small country, with its 24 million people. We do not have the investment dollars to build some of these projects ourselves. We rely on being a destination for investment dollars. I am worried about what this means for Australia not next year and not even in three years time but for the Australia of 2030, the Australia of 2040 and the Australia that my grandchildren will live in. We hear a lot about emissions reduction being the most critical thing we can do. We had a plan. We had an effective plan to be able to use technology and not taxes, to use innovation and the very smart people that we have working in this country to slowly, methodically and in an organised manner reduce emissions in this country. Instead, we are driving out investment dollars. We are driving out our resources sector. We are smashing the regional parts of our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am worried that we will slip back to being a very basic economy, one like that we used to have in years gone by when we didn't enjoy the high salaries and the high quality of life. We in this country are blessed that we have a quality of life and a standard of education and of healthcare services—even with our limited skills and workforce at the moment we still have childcare systems—that are all something that we can be incredibly proud of. We do it in a way that is to the world's highest standards environmentally, and also to make money. It is not a dirty word for companies to be able to make money and to be able to make investment decisions in this country. Where are our trucks going to come from? How are our drivers going to be able to get a return on their investment if they're not driving materials around Western Australia and Queensland and into northern Australia? Where are we going to get the resources and the companies that are paying for these services?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Young people want to engage. They want a future. They want it to be safe. They want to work in an industry where workplace safety is important. They want to work in an industry where environmental outcomes are important. They want to be paid for it. They want to be able to pay off their home. They want to be able to buy a new car. They want to be able to afford to train themselves, their family and their kids to have a better lifestyle than the one we have today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I sincerely worry that this rush to legislation, this rush to these emissions reductions targets is not going to end up in the best outcome for Australia, much less for the world as a whole. We have some of the highest standards of coal, both metallurgical and thermal, in the world. But if you believe the rhetoric we would stop mining our highest quality resources and push those offshore to companies and countries that don't have the same standards we have, that don't have the high grade of minerals and coal that we have. So whilst Australia might have reduced its emissions, the rest of the world won't have. Surely that is not the outcome that we seek to pursue as a nation. We have a responsibility, both in this Senate and in the other place, to be making decisions that are good for this country, that are good for our young people, that enable everybody to be secure and confident, and, as I stated, that are not forcing people to make the decision about whether to buy food or to turn on the electricity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are very, very serious discussions we are having, and I'm concerned that the practical nature of our nation and of the industries that we rely on are being lost. They're being lost in a really lovely statement: we've got to do more for the environment; we've got to do more for the world. Nobody disagrees with living in a cleaner, well-managed planet and nation. But what we do have to seriously understand is that we live in a very competitive world. We compete every day, as a nation, for investment dollars, for our young people to stay in this country and work, and for the high quality of life that we have come to enjoy on the basis of the development of resources and agriculture in this land. This legislation is looking at this and it will see this come to an end, and there is no replacement. There is no alternative to mining, to agricultural production for food security for Australia and for our near neighbours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot support this legislation. I would hope that the government would, at the bare minimum, consider passing an amendment that would see the Productivity Commission review the legislation and its impact on our nation, that it would do it regularly and that it allows for a pause to be set—as we're seeing is happening in the UK, in Germany, in Europe. They are discovering the impact of emissions reduction legislation if it's too fast; it just leads to the loss of jobs, to increased electricity prices that will most impact the people in our society who are least able to get around it. The leafy green inner-city seats are not going to be impacted by this. They will be able to pay their way out of the impact of increased cost of food, of electricity—and they may even be able to go without the well-paid jobs that the resources, mining and agricultural sectors provide. This is our responsibility, to look after those people and ensure we don't legislate against them.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BARBARA POCOCK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  I rise today to speak in favour of the Climate Change Bill 2022 and the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022. I was elected with a crystal-clear mandate from South Australians to get action on climate change, and it's the reason that I'm here. South Australians are already feeling the devastating impacts of the climate crisis. In the summer of 2019-20 we experienced the Black Summer bushfires. They destroyed 196 homes. They injured our frontline responders, including firefighters, and tragically they took the lives of three people. These are our families, our friends and our loved ones. The fires also impacted our environment. They burned about 280,000 hectares, they damaged 17 national parks. Close to 70,000 livestock were killed and 40,000 to 50,000 of our beloved koalas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every year we're experiencing worsening heatwaves and droughts, which are forecast to increase in intensity as the planet heats up. This affects the health of South Australians, particularly those who are most vulnerable, including our older people. It threatens our livelihoods and all the things we love most about our state and our country. It impacts our farmers, food production, the Murray River and our world-class wine industry. Many South Australians live on or enjoy our beautiful coast, but rising sea levels are forecast to put thousands of homes at risk of flooding towards the end of the century. And, of course, we're witnessing an international crisis around climate change that not only affects our beautiful state and country but is imposing terrible costs on the people of Pakistan—and many other countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These impacts are felt by everyone but they are not felt equally by everyone. We know that climate change is having the worst impacts on those who are most vulnerable. We see this with the recent economic shocks caused in part by climate change: inflation from supply-side shocks. This has affected South Australians already struggling to make ends meet. It's affected the most vulnerable first and worst.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Above all, we need to think about our young people: South Australian young people, our kids and their children to come who don't yet have a vote or a voice. They'll be most impacted by the action or lack of action that we choose to take here in Canberra. Any decisions we make need to first and foremost consider them. I'm constantly inspired by the activism and the active hope of young people, of schoolkids, in our state. I joined the school strike for climate action not so long ago, and the young people there were calling for three things: an end to coal and gas; a move to 100 per cent renewable energy generation as quickly as possible, and certainly by 2030; and funding of a just transition for all those who work and live in our communities where fossil fuel is a major area of economic activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also inspired by the farmers, the agronomists, the scientists and the engineers, who are working hard to adapt to the impact of rising temperatures, changing patterns of rainfall and diminished rainfall. They are working so hard to adapt our food production and our transport systems and to make the changes that we know we must make.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in my first speech, I ran for the Senate because I made the mistake of reading the 2018 IPCC report and listening to the scientists studying climate change just as I was asked to think about coming here. I'm here so that I can look future generations in the eye and say that I, with my colleagues, did everything I could.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australians have made this clear too. In polling conducted just before the federal election, a clear majority of South Australians indicated that change on climate action was a most important factor in deciding their vote. A clear majority indicated that the federal government needed to do more to address climate action, and we saw these results across our state, in the city and throughout our regions. In the polls and on the street, people were calling for urgent action to reach net zero emissions and to make sure we don't allow any more new coal or gas mines or coal-fired power stations, which only add to the crisis we face.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australians know that a cleaner, greener future lies ahead and is possible. Our state has led the way with a renewable energy transformation. We switched off the last coal-fired power station in 2016, and at least 60 per cent of our electricity is now generated by renewables, making us second only to Tasmania. Last year, renewable energy generation exceeded demand in South Australia for 180 days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the solutions on climate change and we've got the tools we need to implement them. South Australians are clear. Our Pacific neighbours are clear. The science is clear. We must stop opening new coal and gas fields. We must put the future of our kids before the interests of a small group of fossil fuel profiteers—mostly foreign owned and paying too little tax—who are determined to wring their last fortunes out of fossil fuel extraction while putting our future at risk. We must restore confidence in our democracy by excluding fossil fuel money from politics and rooting out corruption.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill represents a first step. It's not enough. We need to move faster and further than this bill allows. The ratchet mechanism secured by the Greens means the target can be increased over time and won't go backwards, but we need more. We've already reached one degree of warming. South Australians and people across our country and the world are already experiencing the effects of this, including loss of livelihoods and lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want to make a tangible difference, this bill must be followed by strong action. We need to end all new coal and gas projects. We need to legislate a climate trigger to ensure that new emissions-intensive projects do not blow Australia's remaining and rapidly diminishing carbon budget. We need to increase our national targets to align with 1.5 degrees of warming and, most importantly, we need to make sure no-one is left behind in our transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why the Greens are calling for the implementation of a transition authority to support coal and gas communities, as well as advocating for women and First Nations people to get a fair share of the jobs that are emerging in this new and growing economy. Labor cannot claim to take climate action seriously while backing new coal and gas. It just does not stack up. We know the transition to a low-carbon economy has to happen. The question is when. South Australians elected me because they want to see real action now. They know a cleaner, greener future is possible, because we're already leading the way. It's time for Labor to catch up. It's time to get it done. </span>

                    <a href="F49" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Infrastru</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">cture and Transport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Climate Change Bill 2022 and a related bill. Droughts, fires, pandemic and floods: four words which sum up the past decade. I want to highlight the story of a former bus driver from Ballarat, the late Peter Gaylor. Although being a local and loved bus driver took up a fair chunk of Peter's day, he still managed to find time to be a volunteer firefighter. In fact, he was a driver of fire trucks. Peter was also a proud and loyal member of mighty Transport Workers Union. I know his colleagues miss him dearly. Under the conditions of his enterprise agreement, Peter was able to take four weeks of paid leave to volunteer during the Black Summer Bushfires in north-eastern Victoria. Peter spent four weeks day in, day out protecting lives and residences as well as bushland and native habitat. His skills as a qualified heavy vehicle driver saved lives, and his knack for driving protected the team of firefighters who were with him. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fires that Peter faced head on were what many referred to as unprecedented. Lives were lost, species were put on the verge of extinction, 24 million hectares were burnt and more carbon dioxide was released into the atmosphere that Australia emits in a year. It is indisputable that that sheer magnitude of what Peter and so many others faced during the bushfires was exacerbated due to climate change. The consequences of climate change are complex and interrelated. Acting on climate change will lead to safer workplaces and safer roads for all road users, and we need to act now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen climate change intensify with numerous challenging and devastating weather events in recent years. The science is clear and advancements are unanimous. Human activity has caused changes in our atmosphere. The changes have led to significant ongoing disruption in the world's climate. The IPCC <span style="font-style:italic;">Sixth assessment report</span> paints a stark picture of Australia's vulnerability, from declining agricultural production due to hotter, dryer conditions through to the destruction of low-lying coastal areas due to rising sea levels. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, addressing climate change brings with it a wealth of opportunities to support a transition which benefits working people and our communities. In Tasmania, the building of hydro has led to countless Tasmanian jobs, both directly and indirectly. The announcement made by the Prime Minister of an accelerated delivery of fee-free TAFE places will provide us with the skilled workforce that we will need to tackle a warming planet and a changing planet. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to shift to a net zero economy. A report by the Business Council of Australia suggested addressing climate change could add as much as $890 billion to our GDP by 2070. The immediate opportunities for Australians is grasping the renewables revolution. Under Labor's Powering Australia plan, the government will invest $20 billion to update our electricity grid to support more renewables coming into the system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact climate change is having on vulnerable communities is indisputable. Vulnerable communities already experience financial and social disadvantage with fewer resources to cope with, adapt to and recover from the effects of climate change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the bill I rise to speak on today is simply to ensure that Australia's emissions reduction targets are recorded not only in international agreements but also in Commonwealth legislation. Providing certainty and demonstrating commitment: that is what this bill will achieve. Further, the bill will place obligations on the Commonwealth. The consequential amendments bill will insert the consideration of emissions reduction targets into 14 pieces of federal legislation. The legislation will cover Commonwealth departments, entities and schemes that are or could be contributing to national emissions reduction. Embedding emissions reduction targets in legislation will ensure that Commonwealth departments, entities and schemes not only can contribute to emissions reduction targets but can be a springboard for any future targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Policy on the run is not the prerogative of this government. We will be informed by experts every step of the way. This legislation will bring experts back to the table by requiring independent review and independent advice from the Climate Change Authority when it comes to future emissions reduction targets and the actions we take to reach them. This advice will be public, and the minister will be obliged to both formally respond to it and take the advice into account in decision-making. By requiring the minister to make an annual statement to parliament on the progress the government is making on climate change, governments can no longer avoid scrutiny. They will be directly accountable to the parliament and the Australian people, and will have to explain the results of their actions with reference to independent expert advice. This has been sorely missed over the last decade. We saw our Public Service hollowed out under successive coalition governments. Our government is committed to revitalising our Public Service and encouraging frank advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation that we have before us is good. It's good for the country, good for the economy and good for young people. We know young people are taking action in their everyday lives to address climate change. Now they finally have a government that will take action alongside them. Today, being part of a government legislating the Climate Change Bill feels momentous, years in the making and fought for by so many. It is important that we talk about young people because they have been on the front line of the chorus call for change; I know myself, with two young children, 21 and 17, the work they have been advocating for to ensure we get to this day. This day has finally come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time to get on the right side of history, and I say that to those who are seeking to vote against this legislation. The reports, advice and scientific research from business and all sectors of our society say, and the plea from young people is, to get this done and start this necessary work before it is too late. All those people are saying to those who are still on the wrong side of history—who still insist that taking action on climate change is not good for our country, is not good for our economy and is not good for our young people—that they are wrong. It's not just the government who are saying that they're wrong; it's nearly every sector of the Australian community—the business community, unions and the scientific community. Young people are pleading with you. And I ask again that you give up this fight that you have conducted over the last nearly 10 years, and before that, and put this country first, put the economy first, put our young people first and join with the government to support what is going to be a momentous day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will come back and look at this day, with this piece of legislation going through, as being a momentous day—a day when there's going to be proper transparency and proper accountability. That's what this bill seeks to do, to put into legislation—to ensure that the minister responsible is accountable not only to the Australian community but to the Australian parliament. That's what's been sorely missed over this past decade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said, it's important that we take time to consider the young people of Australia, because they have been doing a lot of the heavy lifting, raising the debate and the discussion and engaging with politicians through their schools, talking to one another, talking to their parents and talking to their co-workers. They have been at the forefront of the campaign for this day. They are the front line of change to climate change. They are also going to be on the front line of innovation and action that we will need in order to take on climate change. We know that young people are already taking action in their everyday lives to address climate change, and now they finally have a government who will take action alongside them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say to the opposition, do not ignore them. Come, put aside these failed debates, these failed ideas that you continue to cling to, because you're not doing this country any good. As I said, I am so pleased to be part of a government who is finally taking climate change seriously, and I hear a collective sigh of relief everywhere I go that the Labor Party were elected as government. The Labor Party has taken up the challenge of climate change. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEELE-JOHN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:38</span>):  It has been almost a decade since we have had meaningful federal climate policy in this country. In that time we have lived through fires, we have lived through floods and we have endured heatwaves of intensifying frequency and on unimaginable scales—all of our own making. And by our own making we must now urgently take action on climate change—the action that the public has demanded that we take, after the 10 thirsty years we have endured, all of us withered in the parched wasteland of climate policy, desperately calling for the government to act. Thrust into this very position of action, we find that the best that the Albanese government can offer the community, the student strikers, the doctors, the industry experts, the activists, those championing renewable energy that are demanding, that are so desperately hoping for, urgent action to address the climate crisis is a flimsy 43 per cent emissions reduction target that would be delivered too late to matter. This bill, the Climate Change Bill 2022, along with a related bill, as has been passed through the House, does not by any imagination, by any attempt to stretch the truth or the science, go far enough to address the unravelling climate crisis that our community faces. This bill is the policy equivalent of pushing the food around the plate to make the illusion that you have eaten.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know precisely why the Albanese government has stopped so far short of the targets that we know are needed within this bill to address the climate crisis. It is not because there is any doubt around the veracity of these targets or their urgently needed nature. It is not because they would destroy the economy or pause the power industry or any other of the litany of feculent excuses that the government uses to muddy the rising waters—the reality around us. It is plainly because their fossil fuel paymasters, their corporate overlords, have said so. This is why the Albanese government last month opened up 50,000 new square kilometres of ocean and land to gas and oil exploration—50,000 kilometres! And yet, in making the case for this piece of legislation, the Albanese government looks the community in the eye, looks the climate strikers in the eye, looks the members of Extinction Rebellion—and of so many other organisations coming together to campaign for climate action—in the eye and says that this is action, while in the next breath opening up new coal and gas projects. It would be funny if it wasn't so cruel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The persistence of the fiction of Australian clean coal, this great technological delusion, has captured Australian politics for so long because it is so convenient to the donors, particularly the political parties that accept donations from the fossil fuel industry. It is why this government sits here in support of the Scarborough gas project and of the opening up of the development of the Beetaloo basin. They have refused to rule out supporting new fossil fuel projects as long as they stack up environmentally. Give us a break! It is like endorsing asbestos as long as it doesn't cause mesothelioma. It is like endorsing great plagues of mosquitoes as long as they don't spread malaria. It is an absolute insult to the intelligence of the Australian public to suggest that the government could be taken seriously when suggesting it is acting on climate change while at the same time proposing to open up the Scarborough gas fields and the Beetaloo basin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week the Senate committee inquiry report into this bill revealed to the public what the community have long known: new coal and gas developments are fundamentally inconsistent with Australia's climate obligations. The world's two leading authorities on the issue, the International Energy Agency and the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, emphatically agree that not a single one of these projects stacks up if the object is to act on climate change. What that means is that the bill, as passed by the House and delivered to us in the Senate, categorically and objectively is not good enough. It does not stack up. However convenient it might be for members of this place to delude themselves that this bill goes far enough, it does not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens amendments that we will bring into this chamber are in line with the very bare minimum that we need to meaningfully mitigate catastrophic climate change. The bare minimum means—and say it with me, folks—a moratorium on new coal and gas. That is why the Greens are proposing amendments to the emissions reduction target of at least 75 per cent—not 43 per cent—by 2030. It means that net zero needs to be achieved by 2035, not by 2050. And they will mean working towards reaching negative emissions thereafter. These sets of amendments which we shall bring, as I say—this is not the ceiling. This is not the astronomical height of human ambition. This is not the legislative equivalent of the Apollo program. This is the bare minimum. This is, for the young people of this country, a fighting chance, the opportunity to have, for their generation, the ability to live in a community that is not constantly battling climate crisis after climate crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was meeting with the Australian Red Cross just yesterday, and they were talking to me about the structural challenges that their organisation faces. They're a primary auxiliary component to Australia's disaster relief program, and do you know what one of the main things is that they're facing, one of the main realities they're facing now? They were designed for a period of time when the Red Cross's disaster relief lasted for months. They have been in constant disaster support mode for nearly four years now, as constant natural disaster has followed continual natural disaster.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There may be some of the coal-powered ghouls in this place that mock the amendments and dismiss the amendments brought by the Greens to this legislation as a half-baked leftie fantasy. I can see it now—the tweets are writing themselves in the offices of the National Party, the Liberal Party and, I am sure, in some right-wing sections of the Labor Party as well. But let us make no mistake: a 75 per cent emissions reduction by 2055 is backed by unequivocal, unanimous, global scientific consensus—global scientific consensus. There is no confusion. There is no debate. This is what is needed for our species to survive, and, if we cannot get this right, we have no business taking seats in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have long been the lone voice in this place calling for climate action—actual climate action. It is the Greens who agitated for what became the Clean Energy Act of 2011, which successfully reduced carbon emissions before the coalition government repealed them in 2014. And now once again it is the Greens who will seek to legislate strong climate policy in this country. By supporting this bill as put to us in the house, particularly in the absence of the critical amendments that we have tabled in this chamber, the Greens have shown our willingness to work with the parliament on this issue in the interests of just bloody getting on with it, of clearing a path for all of us to engage in the real work that must follow. The Australian public sent us a clear message at the May election: take action on climate change, and take it now. This is our mandate. This is our solemn sworn duty. This is our opportunity. This is our survival.</span>

It is legislating drastic emissions reductions with virtually no indication of how this will be achieved or how much it will cost Australian taxpayers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In selling this stupidity, Labor promises a jobs bonanza in industries that do not exist and emissions reductions from technologies which do not exist. With this legislation, Labor promises to make even larger cuts to emissions. This isn't going to stop at 43 per cent. The only guarantees from Labor's climate change folly and this legislation will be the death of Australian manufacturing and innovation, chronic high unemployment, reduced living conditions and standards, and even greater rises in the cost of living and doing business in Australia. It will make our current cost-of-living crisis seem like a walk in the park. If you don't believe me, just ask the Europeans. It will make absolutely no meaningful difference to global greenhouse gas emissions.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's total annual emissions are just shy of 500 million tonnes. The CSIRO stated that our emissions are just over one per cent of global emissions. China's total annual emissions are approaching 12 billion tonnes. In the past 20 years, China's share of global emissions has doubled from 15 per cent to 30 per cent. China's emissions are projected to continue to increase for another decade, adding another two billion tonnes to their annual total. It will completely negate any reductions Australia might achieve. What are you going to do when China reneges on its commitments? Impose trade sanctions? Tell them how they're destroying the globe? I'd really like to know: what are you going to say or do? Labor wants Australians to live in tremendous pain for absolutely no gain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For decades now, Australian governments have spent many billions of taxpayers' dollars building wind farms and putting solar panels on household roofs. The result has been massive increases in the cost of energy for most households and businesses, in the order of 300 per cent or more. At the same time, coal-fired power stations have been shut down prematurely, and much of Australia has faced a shortage of energy, with worse to come in the future. How has this been in Australia's best interest, especially given that global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, not fall?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just how friendly to the natural environment are all these wind farms and solar panels? You need 800 tonnes of concrete for the foundation of a single wind turbine, which in turn requires the burning of up to 45 tonnes of coal to produce. Even more coal is used to make the steel and other metals in these turbines. Actually, it's about another 220 to 260 tonnes of coal to make one wind turbine. In North Queensland they are clearing thousands of hectares of rainforest for wind farms, killing our native flora and fauna—great for the environment! Where is the screaming about that one? Are these your environmental credentials? Give me a break.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not long-lived technology. The turbines last about 20 years before they need replacing, and solar panels don't even last half as long. Look at the prime farming land being forever ruined to install solar panels. When they're broken up by a hailstorm or something they leach toxic metals and chemicals into the soil. Where are all the useless old solar panels and wind turbines going to be disposed of—landfill? They do that in America. Tell me what your plan is. Labor has plans everywhere; you're telling me you've got plans. What's your plan for this? Where are the solar panels and wind turbines going to go? Maybe the Greens can tell me. They're pushing for this.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not against renewables, but this unnecessary rush is crippling us. If these technologies are so great, let them compete on a level playing field instead of subsidising them at an enormous cost to taxpayers. We must manage the transition much better, with a mixture of low-emission coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar and nuclear, with the main priority being to not add to Australia's cost of living and to ensure reliable supply.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consider the plans to increase the cost to consumers of purchasing and using vehicles with internal combustion engines to promote more uptake of electric vehicles. How will this do anything other than, once again, raise costs for consumers? Where is all the energy needed to power this EV fleet, when we are already facing energy shortages that are only forecast to become worse? Will the government subsidise the enormous cost of replacing the batteries in these fire-prone vehicles? How will it pay for it? In the end, all these additional and increased costs must be borne by taxpayers and everyday consumers who are already struggling with sharp rises in the cost of living and rising interest rates.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this will be imposed by elected people in this building who are not struggling with the cost of living and who have job and wage security that most Australians can only dream of. It will be imposed by people who have little scientific acumen, if any. Who cares what clueless politicians think about climate change? We should be listening to the credible scientists—those who don't peer review themselves, anyway—and make policy accordingly. This will hand uncounted billions of dollars to foreign owned multinationals that are already well versed and exploiting weak Labor and coalition governments and feasting on Australian taxpayers.</span>

It's all based on the ridiculous idea that unless Australia does this the entire world is doomed. That is completely untrue. It's all based on climate change modelling which has been proven completely inaccurate. I wouldn't even trust or believe a word the IPCC say. Remember how we were told that Australia's coast would be inundated by the sea while our dams went empty? We even heard the Labor Party get up and say that the seas are rising. Well, they're not. Actually, some of the islands have grown in size. Where are all the people who are wanting to sell their homes on the shoreline? They're not wanting to. I'm sure there are some prominent people in this place as well as business people who own prime land by the seaside. Why aren't they leaving? Why aren't they selling their properties?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had these predictions, that the world's coming to an end, from countless people. Really? Has it happened? It hasn't happened. Remember how we were told that we'd experience more frequent storms and bushfires? Well, we've heard that today. It hasn't happened. The fact is that natural weather related disasters were more frequent before 1960 than they are today. We don't relate to anything in this country before 1910, by the records, because there were higher temperatures then, in the late 1890s, but we don't go back that far.</span>

Our decisions must be based on the true, proven science and not be for political or individual financial gain. But they aren't. We don't control the weather and we don't control the climate. It's been completely proven beyond any doubt that changes to the earth's axial tilt and orbit, solar cycles, volcanic activity and ocean temperature oscillations have a far greater influence on our climate. No matter what we do, it will never change our planet's natural occurrences that have occurred for millions of years.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's abundantly clear Labor and the Greens are deliberately ignoring the valuable lessons being delivered right now by Europe's failed experiment with renewable energy. European nations are now scrambling to fire up coal-fired power stations to make up for the shortfall of energy caused by an overreliance on wind power. They've learned that they can't rely on these intermittent technologies and that they must have reliable energy to keep homes heated and the lights on.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Germany, householders are now turning to firewood for energy to heat their homes. There is, in fact, such a high demand for wood that they're importing it from neighbouring Poland. In Britain people are dying due to lack of energy to heat their homes, because it isn't available or it simply costs far too much. Labor is legislating the same disaster for Australia. Those Australians seeking to impose this disaster on our country have been hoodwinked by false prophets such as Tim Flannery, Al Gore and Greta Thunberg. Our children are being brainwashed into believing the world is coming to an end. If you accept this unproven rubbish, then maybe the deprivation and pain to come from this legislative disaster is a harsh but necessary lesson to follow the facts and the science, rather than worshipping false prophets of doom.</span>

Where have we really had the true debate? I'm not talking about—we're politicians in this place and we have to make our decisions based on what we research and what we understand. I think this is beyond us and we really need to hear from the true scientists, not those that do their own peer reviews or those that are pushing their own agenda because they've been given jobs in organisations and they're getting very well paid for the positions that they hold.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decisions we are going to make about pushing this 43 per cent—and this is only the floor of emissions targets in the country—are going to have an impact on the cost of living for Australians. The cost of living for Australians now is killing them. They can't manage. People can't put food on the table. They're struggling to put a roof over their heads. Families are living in their cars. This is only going to add to the cost.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said in my speech, I'm not against renewables, but you actually have to look at what's happened in Europe and other countries around the world who have pushed this for a far longer period of time than what we have, and yet we're heading down this path. Can't we see the impact it's going to have on our people here? To say you're going to create 600,000 jobs is a load of bloody BS as far as I'm concerned. Actually, I've been told that some of the science shows we're going to lose that many jobs in Australia. How can you go to renewables when you're going to actually increase jobs? Where are the jobs coming from? Solar panels? You're clearing prime agricultural land, you're sticking the solar panels on it and that's it; you walk away from it. Where are the jobs being created?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know industries and manufacturing are shutting down because they can't afford the electricity to run in this country, so they're going overseas. That is what you're going to do to this country. And the things that we have relied on—you talk about the coal. How is digging up coal, which we should be using for our own energy in this country—we're exporting it. No problem; let's export it. We're getting the dollars for it. So you've got a problem with exporting to China or India or any other country like that, and they're burning it. This is global. So what are you worried about? Do you think we have a blanket over our country, that cutting back our emissions is going to save us? It doesn't work that way. This is global.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So if you want to make the tough decisions then cut down all the coalmines. I'm against it because it doesn't make sense to me. We have new coal-fired power stations that are 90 per cent emissions free. We have the coal, we have the resources, we have everything here, and you just want to shut it down. I warn you: we will end up a Third World country. In Africa there are countries where 70 per cent of people don't have electricity. They're cooking in their homes by fires, which gives them health issues. There are children who can't do their homework, because they don't have electricity. They don't have fridges to keep food or medications in. They are in poverty.</span>

This is a stupid bloody policy that I and One Nation will never support. Put a plan on the table whereby we will move forward with renewables and other energy resources that will build our country, not destroy it and future generations.</span>

                    <a href="168275" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHELDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:05</span>):  I rise to speak on the Climate Change Bill 2022 and a related bill. This is a bill that delivers on the government's commitment to restore national leadership on climate change. It provides the certainty and confidence needed to drive the transition to net zero by 2050. A decade has been squandered in ignoring the urgency of the task before us. But now, more than ever before, there is no time to be lost in facing the reality of climate change and how it can devastate our lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Special Envoy for Disaster Recovery, I've been meeting communities who have been directly affected by climate change. I have listened to what they've had to say. We know that because of climate change natural hazards—floods, bushfires, violent storms and cyclones—will become more frequent and more severe. All too often, the outcome of these natural hazards is a humanitarian disaster. If we apply real leadership to the disaster recovery task and listen to the communities affected, this doesn't always have to be the case. There is an alternative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Disaster recovery not only involves cleaning up for days, weeks and months afterwards; it also means working alongside communities to reduce their future disaster risk through preparedness and mitigation. In the six weeks since being appointed to the special envoy role I've visited communities in the Bega Valley in southern New South Wales, the Lockyer Valley in Queensland, the Hunter Valley in New South Wales, Western Sydney and the Northern Rivers region of northern New South Wales. In Cobargo, in the Bega Valley, last week I met locals including Zena Armstrong. Zena and others in her community have worked tirelessly since Cobargo was knocked sideways by the 2019-20 Black Summer bushfires. Roads, bridges and other infrastructure were destroyed. Six people, unfortunately, lost their lives, and 300,000 hectares were wiped out. All this happened in a community of just 2,200 people. Yet Cobargo is slowly pulling itself back together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Zena told me that it helps to have a good stock of social capital before disaster hits. By 'social capital' she means a community's capacity to face immense hazards and overcome disaster, however adverse the circumstances are. This is a capacity derived from community cohesion and an ability to adapt to quickly changing circumstances. Zena went on to say that there is also the challenge of legitimatising unexpected leadership at times of crisis and balancing the wide range of community needs that arise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I was in Ballina, Lismore, Huonbrook and Mullumbimby in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales. I visited Cabbage Tree Island and an Aboriginal community in Ballina that was devastated by this year's floods. Chris Binge, CEO of the Jali Local Aboriginal Land Council, gave me a tour of the island, which, until the events of March, was a thriving community of 27 homes. Now it's like a ghost town. Its residents have been relocated for safety reasons to nearby Wardell while plans for the community's future are developed. Mr Binge said: 'We are the biggest landholders in the Ballina Shire area, but we have struggled until now to get real attention. If we were a white corporation, people would be knocking down our doors to deal with us.' I hear your plea, Chris.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change and therefore disaster recovery is an area where the national interests, not political pointscoring, must take the lead. Last week in Lismore I announced a $30 million return to business recovery grant. It was a perfect example of the bipartisan way in which we must go about disaster recovery. To announce the program I was joined not only by the state member for Lismore, Janelle Saffin—a good friend of mine—but also by the Nationals member for Page, Kevin Hogan, and the Lismore mayor, Steve Krieg. Steve is both an independent councillor and a business owner in the CBD. Steve spoke for his fellow business owners when he welcomed the commercial landlords grant, saying it would take a great deal of pressure off businesses, like his, that are struggling to get on their feet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even as disaster recovery must be a bipartisan affair, that does not mean that improvements on previous approaches can't be made. Previous funding arrangements have seen the vast majority of disaster funding going to immediate recovery rather than to mitigation. That is even though the evidence from the US National Institute of Building Sciences shows that for every $1 spent on mitigation $6 are saved in recovery. Disaster costs $38 billion annually, according to a 2021 Deloitte report. The same report calculates that by 2060, without any changes to our approach, disasters will cost the economy $94 billion a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to strengthen significantly our capacity to cope with disaster. That means we need to do more than just respond when disasters hit. The Albanese government's Disaster Ready Fund will enable us to spend $200 million each year to change how individuals, communities and industry think about and act on disaster risk—in other words, increasing strength. The Disaster Ready Fund will replace the former government's $4.8 billion Emergency Response Fund, which failed to complete any mitigation projects in the lead-up to the February and March floods. In the ERF's three years, it did not complete a single mitigation project or release a cent in recovery funding. Instead, it earned the government more than $800 million in interest, taking the total of the fund to nearly $5 billion, with nothing to show for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During my recent visit to Cobargo and Quaama in the Bega Valley, I heard from local women Danielle Murphy and Christina Walters about how the previous Emergency Response Fund did not focus adequately on community needs for rebuilding after the Black Summer bushfires. Danielle said 'withdrawal of supports which never realised their full potential and the herd mentality of recovery' were her concerns. While in Bega last week, I met with Arthur Rorris, the secretary of the South Coast Labour Council. Arthur has this week pulled together the very successful Union Towns Australia Conference in Wollongong, which directly addresses the important role of community in withstanding disaster. I also had an extensive briefing from Leanne Atkinson, the acting CEO of the Bega Local Aboriginal Land Council. Leanne told me the of importance of having a local recovery agency on the ground and, 'where they can, remain nimble, which enables them to respond to the everchanging needs of the community. The arms-length Sydney- or Canberra-centric approach simply does not work'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our focus on investment in mitigation projects will help reduce some of the burdens on taxpayers' funds that would otherwise have been incurred. Addressing vulnerability and the root causes of disasters is key to managing systematic risk, risk that will increase as the effects of climate change mount. Repairing damaged and destroyed infrastructure is helpful, and may protect some in the short term, but alone it will never be enough to protect everyone or to ensure Australia's prosperity. Rather, inclusive and collective disaster-risk-reduction plans, efforts and actions are key to building communities and our response.</span>

                  <a href="281503" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CICCONE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:14</span>):  Tuesday of last week was National Forestry Day. As most people would know, forestry is an industry that I am not just very passionate about but is very close to my heart, as are the communities that this industry supports right across Australia, particularly around the many regional communities in my home state of Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a great time to be talking about forestry, in the context of the Albanese Labor government's plan to tackle climate change and of the Jobs and Skills Summit from last week. I had the pleasure of returning to Australian Sustainable Hardwoods—or ASH, as it is commonly known—in Gippsland last month, accompanied by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Watt, and the local federal member for Gippsland, Darren Chester. ASH is Australia's leading manufacture of timber products, and I have visited their impressive facility several times now. It was great to return with my good friend Senator Watt, as part of the government, and, of course, with Nationals MP Darren Chester. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor took a bold vision to the election. We have set ourselves the task of building a better future by bringing the country together. We know we need to invest in skills and to create good jobs, the very kinds of jobs where you can support not just yourself but also your family and your community. ASH is a model employer. It sets an example for the kinds of businesses that we want to encourage in our economy and in regional communities. The company employs apprentices. It trains people right on the site and provides clear career pathways. All the managers at ASH started on the shop floor. They invest back into their business to create more opportunities—more opportunities for their workers and more opportunities for the local community. We heard about the growing number of women in their workforce, thanks to investments made in advanced manufacturing processes. It was great to meet with a number of the workers, particularly Kerry, one of the delegates on site and a longstanding employee of ASH. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They also have a very strong working relationship with the union—for the record, the CFMMEU. Their manufacturing division works very constructively with management, the workers and other members of the community. They work together to professionally address any issues on site, and both make an important effort to advance the forestry industry. They know that protecting and growing the industry is in the interests of the workers and of the business. ASH also supports the local community by providing funding for projects undertaken by groups like the local sporting clubs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These practices of education, investment, cooperation and community engagement are exactly the kinds of practices that we were discussing just last week at the Jobs and Skills Summit. These are the principles that the Albanese government believes must underpin our economy. It is great to see this spirit of cooperation at individual businesses like ASH and, at a macro level, at the Jobs and Skills Summit. This is what it will take to tackle the big challenges that we are facing as a country, including addressing labour shortages, wage stagnation, the rising cost of living and, of course, climate change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of climate change, no discussion about our forestry industry would be complete without talking about the significant contribution it makes to reducing our carbon footprint. Tree plantations in Victoria store around 8.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide each year, and this timber can be used instead of less sustainable products to manufacture products and buildings. Timber really is an ultimate renewable source. That's what makes it even more infuriating when supposedly environmentally minded activists attack this industry. Antiforestry propaganda damages our ability to take meaningful action on climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year in this chamber I spoke about a paper that was published by the Centre of Policy Studies at Victoria University entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Z</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ero Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 2050</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span style="font-style:italic;">hat it means for the Australian Economy, Industries and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Regions.</span> The paper showed that, in taking action to pursue net zero, our forestry industry would almost double in size. This clearly demonstrates that forestry is key to our low-emissions future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only are antiforestry activists disrupting the lives of our timber workers and hurting an industry that supports regional communities; they are making it more difficult for us to reach our climate goals. When Minister Watt, Darren Chester and I were being shown around ASH in Heyfield, we were looking at the kind of business that Australia's future must be built on: a business providing good jobs, training and career pathways; a business that works collaboratively with the union movement; and also a business that, through its activities, is playing an important role in tackling climate change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">ASH is not the only forestry related business that I've had the pleasure of visiting recently. I also spent some time at the Sorbent Paper Company mill in Box Hill, down the road from my electorate office. Sorbent has a really sophisticated operation, and it was great to get an understanding of how we produce a very sophisticated product, Australian toilet paper, facial tissues and hand towels, which I'm sure all Australians were in desperate need of during the last couple of years because of the pandemic. I don't think any of us in this place ever expected toilet paper to be such an important subject of public debate, but panic buying brought on by the pandemic ensured that toilet paper was all over the front pages and social media. It just shows us how important it is to have a very secure and sustainable supply chain in this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I enjoyed hearing from the Sorbent team about how they managed supply through this period, to keep a steady flow of stock to supermarkets and other retailers, and how they are continuing to innovate and produce Australian-made products. I want to thank Denise Campbell Burns, the National President of the CFMMEU Manufacturing Division, for setting up this visit to the Sorbent facility. It was fantastic to meet many of the members and workers who were there and who have kept this mill going for many, many years. Some of these workers have been there for decades actually, producing goods that Australians use every single day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think sometimes these sorts of jobs get lost in discussions about work, whether that's in parliaments, the media or academia. We sometimes think of these long-term, secure jobs as things of the past, but these are jobs that we should all aim to build for the future. There's no reason that well-paid, secure jobs with long-term career pathways have to be a thing of the past. ASH and Sorbent are already showing us that these jobs can and should exist in a modern Australia, with good businesses and strong unions working together to create secure jobs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to be part of an Albanese Labor government that is committed to making sure that more of the jobs created in Australia look like these jobs. We'll achieve this by resisting the politics of division. There are some that do want to pit businesses and unions against each other: big business against small business, workers against unions. But this is not the approach of this Labor government. Our approach was on display last week at the Jobs and Skills Summit. We have big challenges and big opportunities ahead of us to meet these challenges and seize on these opportunities so that we can all work together—governments, business, unions, civil society. I'm encouraged by the spirit of cooperation that we have already seen around the country, whether it's at businesses like ASH or Sorbent, at the 100 local jobs and skills summits held by the government right across Australia or, indeed, at the main event last week. I want to thank again Minister Watt, for visiting Gippsland; Darren Chester, for showing us around his great electorate; as well as the CFMMEU Manufacturing Division and the Sorbent Paper Company for organising that visit in Box Hill some weeks ago. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="217241" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McGRATH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:24</span>):  It is important that today I use this time to reflect on my home state of Queensland and in particular praise the Brisbane City Council for their significant contribution to Brisbane over the last decade. In particular, I want to recognise their great work over the last three years under the leadership of Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner. While there are over 500 local government bodies across Australia, the Brisbane City Council is Australia's largest council, serving a population of over 1.2 million people. It goes without saying that the successful administration of this grassroots local government does not come without its challenges, especially with a constituency of this size. As such, much praise is due for team Schrinner's work in putting the Brisbane City Council on the map and furthering Brisbane's reputation as Australia's most liveable city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Taking a moment to reflect upon the financial stresses and pressures facing ratepayers and small businesses during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, I will say that the Brisbane City Council's commitment to its constituents during this time was both firm and unfaltering. Rates were frozen for council residents and CBD businesses, providing much-needed support where it was due. Fast-forward to when the International Olympic Committee selected Brisbane as the host city of the 2032 Olympic Games. The Brisbane City Council got to work immediately, engaging all levels of government to ensure the timely and successful delivery of the world's largest sporting event—an event that a former Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Graham Quirk, had the foresight and the vision to argue for, for many years, saying it was Brisbane's time to hold the Olympic Games.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have city-shaping projects like the Brisbane Metro, green bridges and the transformation of Victoria Park, which are underway thanks to the forward thinking of team Schrinner in recognising these as important infrastructure assets in readying Brisbane for the games as well as for the future. In particular, the council's commitment to city-shaping transport infrastructure is really shown in the delivery of the new Brisbane Metro. The Brisbane City Council is providing the 'turn up and go' metro that Brisbane residents need in order to get home sooner and safer. Gone are the days of inefficient and unreliable public transport, with great progress being made to link the city to the suburbs and the suburbs to the suburbs. Team Schrinner must be commended for its functional execution of fully electric, high-capacity metros that are ensuring that Brisbane remains the most liveable city in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only that, but the Brisbane City Council is also actively growing a greener Brisbane. More than 13,000 trees have been planted along the residential footpaths as part of the Greener Suburbs project, while bringing people together through community planting initiatives. Meanwhile, the council has also managed over 9½ thousand hectares of natural conservation areas while facilitating nature based activities and the protection of our biodiversity. A cleaner, greener Brisbane is a key priority for team Schrinner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it cannot be forgotten that all this has been delivered despite the devastating flooding which affected Brisbane residents particularly hard earlier this year. The sheer volume of rain experienced had a devastating impact across the city. It affected more than 20,000 properties and almost 200 community and sports clubs across 177 suburbs, grounding CityCats and ferries and damaging roads, parks, paths and bikeways. The outstanding work of team Schrinner both during and after the floods is commendable. Under team Schrinner's direction, the council single-handedly provided more than $4½ million in rates relief for affected residents and more than $1.5 million in financial relief for community organisations. This was alongside the cleaning of 170 kilometres worth of bikeways and the filling in of more than 70,000 potholes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen Councillor James Mackay's satellite landfill initiative, to streamline the waste-clearing process, and Councillor Sarah Hutton's recharge station initiatives for residents without power, as well as Ryan Murphy's transport reforms. These are all fantastic examples of Brisbane City Council's getting creative to deliver for their constituents and demonstrate the initiative and the vision that team Schrinner offers Brisbane residents. It is clear that the Brisbane City Council has made an impressive commitment to build back better and protect the lifestyle of all Brisbane residents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At all levels of government, especially local government, residents want and expect their elected representatives to deliver the basic services they need to make their life easier. But, while team Schrinner keeps delivering for Brisbane, there remains one obvious handbrake on progress in Queensland, and that, of course, is the Queensland Labor government and that shiny, shimmering, red-carpet-hugging premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, from cancelling cabinet meetings—and this is true—so she can sail with her boyfriend and billionaires and celebrities on a glitzy yacht off Hamilton Island, to integrity and health crises. Remember when goons from the premier's office raided the private office of the integrity commissioner and stole the laptop and had it wiped? We all wonder what was on the laptop, don't we? What photos were on that laptop, Premier Palaszczuk? Queenslanders have clearly had enough of Palaszczuk and the rotten Labor Party in our state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately for Queenslanders, Annastacia Palaszczuk is more concerned with how things look than how things are, which says a lot about why she has hired the entire press gallery in Queensland to avoid media scrutiny.</span>
              </p>

                  </a>  Yes, we've got low, low unemployment in Queensland, thanks to the government employing everybody in the Premier's office. In her own private media team, she has more than any particular newsroom in Queensland. She's very good at hiring ex-journos, she's very good at making sure her image is out there, but she's not very good at delivering for Queenslanders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look across Queensland, there are a lot of problems in Queensland. Queenslanders have to wait over seven hours over the recommended time at emergency wards. That's seven hours over the recommended time. People are dying in ambulances outside of hospitals because the ambulances are being ramped and people are dying in the ambulances. This is what's happening in Queensland today. This is not some Third World country where they don't have operating hospitals; this is Queensland.</span>

Their service for sick people in Queensland is completely cooked, because it's Queenslanders who are paying the price of this arrogant, out-of-touch Premier who would prefer to spend her time on glitzy yachts or at the Logies. She is the Premier for first nights; she is not the Premier for overnight in hospital, because she doesn't want to see the sick state that Queensland is in because of her mismanagement.</span>

It gets worse: they've got a waiting list for a waiting list. There are 230,000 people on the waiting list to get on the waiting list. Welcome to Queensland! Perfect one day, sick the next day under this malignant, poisonous Labor government who want to just play politics and not get on and ensure that Queenslanders have the health system that they deserve. I will give a teaser: I will come back tomorrow and talk about what some of those other cabinet ministers are doing in Queensland. Guess what? It's not good.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:34</span>):  Takayna/Tarkine, in the north-west of my home state of lutruwita truwana Tasmania, is stolen land. It was never ceded by Aboriginal people, and it still belongs to them. It is also one of the most beautiful places in the world. It's a place of peaceful rivers, of rugged mountains, of majestic forests. It's a place of the most striking rocky coastlines and sweeping beaches that are pounded by the westerly and south-westerly swells that sweep in from the Southern Ocean. It's also home to some of the cleanest air in the world, which travels three-quarters of the way around our globe before it strikes those coastlines. It's globally recognised for its link to the ancient supercontinent of Gondwanaland, and the forests in takayna/Tarkine are an incredibly important carbon sink. It contains a massive tract of Gondwanan cool temperate rainforest. Those forests, mountains, coastlines and rivers of takayna/Tarkine are worthy of protection, and they're not worthy of the exploitation they are facing at the moment. What we should be doing is listing takayna/Tarkine as part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage area, we should be making it a national park and we should be returning it to the people under whose stewardship it existed for many tens of thousands of years, the takayna people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that area there is a company, MMG, a Chinese state-owned mining giant. MMG has a plan to destroy nearly 300 hectares of this precious place—of that precious, carbon-rich, threatened-species-rich rainforest—in order to build a toxic tailings dam at their mine site near Rosebery. They've made an application to do this under the EPBC Act, and the decision now as we sit here today rests with the relatively new Minister for the Environment and Water, Ms Plibersek. This minister is now the seventh consecutive environment minister to ignore the Australian Heritage Council's findings that takayna/Tarkine holds outstanding heritage values and has a high probability of meeting the criteria for World Heritage listing and the Australian Heritage Council's recommendation that the area be listed on our country's National Heritage List. That's what the minister should be doing: listing this beautiful place on the National Heritage List, as recommended by the Australian Heritage Council, and nominating it for inclusion in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. But instead the minister is now considering MMG's application for a toxic tailings dam. It's important that folks understand that MMG has an alternative solution for its tailings, and that is what the company should be pursuing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent times, thanks to a massive citizen science project, the Bob Brown Foundation took many hundreds of recordings of masked owls, a listed endangered species, on the very site of the proposed tailings dam, and those recordings included breeding calls and chattering calls, which indicate that juvenile owls live in that forest. It's not just the masked owl, a magnificent and striking predator bird, an endemic species to Tasmania, that is going to have its home destroyed by this proposed tailings dam; we've got the spotted-tail quoll, the wedge-tailed eagle and the Tasmanian devil all resident in this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Successive governments and successive ministers have failed in their duty to protect takayna/Tarkine and failed in their duty to nominate that area for inclusion in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, despite the International Union for the Conservation of Nature having twice requested that the nomination be brought forward. So to Minister Plibersek, I say: do the right thing. Protect takayna/Tarkine on behalf of the people of Tasmania, the people of Australia and the people of the globe. Do it for people alive now and for people who are not yet born, and do it as soon as you possibly can. As part of that, please reject this application from MMG for a toxic tailings dam. That is an unacceptable imposition on one of the most beautiful, important carbon-rich places in the world.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not a coincidence that, as the fight to protect nature and climate gets ever more desperate, governments around this country are doing more and more to protect big corporations from ordinary people who are fighting back, and that includes not only folks involved with the Bob Brown Foundation down in my home state of Tasmania but also people all around this country who are fighting to defend nature, who are fighting for real climate action by putting their bodies on the line. Good on them and more power to them for doing it. We have seen in Tasmania and in other states governments smashing freedom of speech and freedom of action, and passing draconian antiprotest laws. It is a pattern we are seeing repeated around the country, and it is being done because they are trying to arrest their way out of that citizen rebellion, which is growing by the day in this country. They will soon find that they haven't got jails big enough for us all. That is what they will find.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the one side, you have the big corporations run by psychopathic CEOs and senior managers who are determined to strip as much profit as they can out of this late-stage disaster capitalist system that we are living under, while burning the planet just as quickly as they can. Then they have their agents, those psychopaths in this place—politicians from the major parties—who come in here and do their bidding. That is on one side. On the other side are the real climate wars I'm not talking about Mr Albanese's confected kinds of wars. On the other side are those brave, heroic people who are standing up against those massive corporations, putting their bodies on the line to defend nature, to defend our climate and to call for real climate action and real action to protect biodiversity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know which side of the fight we are on. I invite other folks in this chamber to think about which side of the fight they find themselves on. Some of us are prepared to stand up and to take the fight directly to those psychopathic operations and to their agents in this place, those people who are purchased by those massive corporate donations, the institutionalised bribes that flow so rapidly and at such size around this building. At the behest of their big, polluting corporate donors, Liberal and Labor governments are trying to arrest people and put them in prison when the only thing they have done is try to stand up for a livable planet and stand up for a sustainable future for their children and grandchildren.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Silencing people will not work. No amount of antidemocratic, draconian legislation is going to protect big corporations from the consequences of their actions. The people of Australia want nature protected. They want real climate action, not the facade being offered by this government, and they want a safe, inhabitable climate for them and their children.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:44</span>):  One of the major criticisms of the Morrison government was that they never took responsibility for their mistakes. They went to great lengths to never admit when they were wrong. This new Labor government is committed to being accountable. In that spirit I want to acknowledge that our bargaining system, which both parties have contributed towards, does not work. The single-enterprise-centric bargaining system introduced by Labor in the 1990s is no longer fit for purpose. To end the right of workers to pursue multiple-employer agreements was a mistake. That system laid the groundwork for subsequent coalition governments to launch a full-scale assault on the rights of workers to collectively bargain. It opened the door for the Howard government's Work Choices legislation and some of the most extreme antiworker legislation ever introduced in the developed world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor sought to repair the damage done by Work Choices through the Fair Work Act in the late 2000s. The Fair Work Act included a provision for multi-employer bargaining in low-paid industries, but that provision has failed. It has failed to create a real multi-employer bargaining option for low-paid industries, and, worse still, the act has loopholes that employers have been exploiting to drive wages down. The nine years of the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments were the worst period for wages in Australia's history. It was a lost decade for the Australian middle class. We've had almost an entire decade where wages and the standard of living of the Australian middle class have gone backwards. This government was elected on a mandate to ensure that Australian workers do not go any further backwards. We were elected on a mandate to ensure that we get real wages growing again. But, to be blunt, real wages will not grow if we do not fix our industrial relations system. It's that simple. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the productivity growth, we've seen massive profit growth, but none of that is getting through to workers. Fundamentally, that means Australian workers do not have enough power to bargain for their fair share. If you don't have power to bargain, all you have left is the Oliver Twist approach favoured by the last government, where workers have to come on their hands and knees to their employer and say, 'Please, sir, can I have some more?' And, even where good employers want to give their workers a fair go, they are inevitably undercut by dodgy employers who want to squeeze every last penny out of their workforce. So how do we put real power back in the hands of Australian workers? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, we need to undo the mistakes of the last few decades and cut the red tape preventing multi-employer bargaining. We need multi-employer bargaining for industries where low pay is entrenched as part of doing business. I'm talking about industries such as child care, where today thousands of workers are taking strike action to fight for a fair go. I'm talking about industries like aged care, where nine in 10 workers are hired on insecure, part-time or casual contracts. Unless workers in these industries can bargain collectively, they do not have the power to get paid fair value for their essential work. Ray Collins, an aged-care organiser at the Health Workers Union, told the job security inquiry last year:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The business model to operate when you're using a casualised workforce is to keep everybody hungry, lean and green.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ray told us how aged-care employers hire their entire workforces on part-time contracts, where each worker is only guaranteed a few hours a week. They might work a 30-hour week, but they're only guaranteed three hours, so, if anyone complains about not having PPE or not having enough time to properly care for residents, the employer can take almost all their hours away and throw them into poverty. If someone doesn't agree to take on a shift with one hour's notice, they lose their hours. Aged-care workers are put in a position where they are constantly on call, where they can't take leave, where they can't speak up about any problems because, at the drop of a hat, their employer can take all of their hours away. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sherree Clarke, an aged-care nurse, told the job security inquiry:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When my mother went through cancer, I couldn't tell her that I would support her to appointments, because, if you're not available to pick up a shift, they don't offer you a shift the next time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And Sherree can't do anything about this because they do not have a real voice or real bargaining power. It's not only happening in the care industries that have been underpaid and undervalued for years. Even in jobs that used to be well paid and strongly unionised, the lack of a worker voice is driving a race to the bottom. Look at aviation. Getting a job at Qantas used to mean a lifelong career. It used to be that, were you a pilot, a flight attendant or a ground handler at Qantas, you were the cream of the crop. You could raise a family. You were highly trained and highly experienced. You took pride in your work because you were the best of the best, and you were paid a rate of pay that reflected that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was the spirit of Australia, but not anymore. Our industrial relations system has failed Qantas workers, as it has failed many Australians. It has failed to give them a proper voice and proper power. Alan Joyce has steamrolled them all and led the way for so many more. Qantas has set up shell companies to hire workers on lower pay and conditions than direct Qantas employees, and Mr Joyce gradually moved the entire workforce into these shell companies or, worse still, he moved them to external labour hire firms. He illegally outsourced nearly 2,000 people, and the Federal Court said that he did not have to rehire them because he would probably sack them again anyway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> on Monday night we saw brave current and former Qantas employees speak out about this. Matthew Allsop was a flight attendant at Qantas for 16 years, and I will quote Matthew, who said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I was with the Qantas group of companies just shy of 16 years … I managed to work for wholly owned subsidiaries or labour hire firms … but never actually worked for Qantas Airways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… each time to slowly erode the high value of pay and conditions that once existed in the legacy part of the airline.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… on any given day, you would have crew employed under four different contracts. So we had our wholly-owned New Zealand-based subsidiary, the UK-based subsidiary, and then you had your two Australian subsidiaries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alan Joyce can do this because Qantas workers do not have real bargaining power. If you have workers on one plane being hired by five different companies but they can't even bargain together, they have no power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the same story in the mining industry. BHP have dusted off the Alan Joyce playbook and set up their own shell company as well. They call it BHP Operation Services. BHP told the job security inquiry that only 29 per cent of workers on their mine sites are actually employed by BHP. The rest are employed by their shell company or by external labour hire firms, and they are paid an average of 24 per cent less for doing the exact, same job. That is a 24 per cent pay cut for these workers, because they do not have real bargaining power. They can't bargain directly with BHP, because BHP is not technically their employer. If you want to face the wages disaster of the last decade, we need to fix bargaining, because Qantas, BHP and so many others are making a mockery of our industrial relations system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, only today, if you look at the ABS statistics that have just come through, you will see the effect that those sorts of figures have on so many Australians and the disconnect with what is a fair return for labour. Real unit labour costs have dropped for four successive quarters as a result of the previous government, while the labour share of income has fallen to a new record low and the profit share has hit a new high, according to ABS national accounts data released today. It's companies like Qantas and BHP that have gamed the system over the last decade. There is an opportunity for us to change that system so that there is a fair share for all and all Australians in the Australian middle class can get their fair share of the Australian pie.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="283601" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator VAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:53</span>):  The situation in Ukraine affects us all. Russia's unjust and illegal invasion has upended Europe and the globe through food shortages, fuel shortages and inflation. The knock-on effects are reverberating around the world, yet only a handful of countries are assisting. Many are not, and some are not even condemning this heinous breach of international law. As Ukraine is a major exporter of critical food supplies such as wheat, barley, corn and sunflower oil, we will likely see an increasingly volatile and unstable world as food shortages increase. This will affect our security more directly, as many of our closest neighbours are heavily reliant on Ukrainian wheat, and they will be impacted by not only the high prices but also the lack of supply. One only has to look at Sri Lanka to see the effect that poor economic conditions and food shortages have had on that nation's stability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As some will be aware, I recently travelled to Ukraine, not just to Kyiv for a photo-op but into the theatre of operations in Donbas, to see where the Australian-built and donated Bushmasters are being used by the Ukrainian troops. I was able to gain an immense amount of first-hand knowledge by being there, speaking to the people and seeing the war unfold before my eyes. That is why it is an absolute travesty that this government has not reopened our embassy in Ukraine. Some of you will know that our embassy in Ukraine shares a building with the Canadian embassy. It was truly a sad sight on my morning jog, the first morning I was in Kyiv, to see the Canadian flag flying above that building but not an Australian one. Many, if not most, other countries have returned their embassies to Kyiv, and I call on this government to send our wonderful ambassador, Bruce Edwards, back from Warsaw to Kyiv, along with the defence attache and a large defence contingent. Why? Because there is a lot to learn from this war, and, in this increasingly complex strategic environment in which we find ourselves, we should be doing everything possible to learn as much as possible about how this war is being fought.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, that is why many embassies in Ukraine have sent in a somewhat large defence contingent, located in country: not only so they can support Ukraine to the best of their ability but also so they can learn as much as possible and incorporate that knowledge into future fighting plans. One of the major lessons I learned from my time in the Donbas theatre of operations was the importance of combined arms fighting and how this is shaping the battlefield. Despite what many analysts are saying, combined arms are working incredibly effectively in that area. This just goes to show the importance of having people in country, learning firsthand from the events on the ground. One of the things I learnt is that the Ukrainians are using our Bushmasters more like an infantry fighting vehicle than a protected mobility vehicle, which is what they were built for. But they are proving effective in battle and saving lives, even though this is something they were not made for. Yet, in the meantime, this government is sitting on its hands and not making any decision on the LAND 400 Phase 3B project, a project that would put our troops in much safer vehicles than the current Bushmaster or Boxer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us not forget that if Russia stops fighting then the war will end, but if Ukraine stops fighting, because of a lack of support, Ukraine ends as a country. However, Ukraine needs firepower to end this war. This means Australia and other countries, particularly European countries, in whose part of the world this war is being fought, must provide more weapons to Ukraine. From Australia, this should include more Bushmasters—at least 60 more than have already been committed—to arm another brigade. I met with the commanding officer of the 80th Brigade, the air assault troops that are using them to plug the lines when the Russians try to break the battle lines. But, as Ukraine's ambassador suggested this week, we should be sending Hawkeis, another protected mobility vehicle. We should be sending M777 howitzers and the 155-mm ammunition that's fired from them, as well as high-technology weapons such as the DefendTex drones that we've sent in there, and the DroneShield air defence system—all made in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other countries should be sending air defence materiel as well, including fighter jets and guided missiles, as well as more armour, especially tanks, like the German Leopard tanks, of which there are thousands sitting idle, as well as IFVs and more artillery. Yes, helmets are helpful, but they won't help Ukraine win this war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must also reassess whom we look to in the future to complete defence deals with. The war in Ukraine has highlighted how many countries in Europe have been unwilling in meaningful ways to help one of their closest neighbours in this fight. If we are to shore up our own security, we cannot be relying on those who won't protect their neighbours, let alone a country on the other side of the globe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Ukraine comes into winter we must also start looking at providing them with more humanitarian aid. The word that everyone is using over there right now is 'winterisation'. How do they protect their people who have been damaged by the war, their homes destroyed by Russian missiles and rockets, during the cold of a Ukraine winter? Ukrainian winters get down to minus 10 quite often, and the fear is that more people will die of cold than from Russian bullets and missiles. With temperatures like that, provisions such as materials for housing repairs—which we don't need to ship; we could pay for them—or replacement shelter like flat pack housing, warm clothes that they've lost when their houses have been blown up and energy such as more coal and gas shipments are desperately needed in the coming winter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Ukrainian people are warm, generous, resilient people and are dedicated to defeating the army of Putin's murderous regime. Virtually everyone I met there, from cab drivers to baristas to hotel workers, was saying to me how much they were looking forward to joining the fight when they are called up, and all of them were disappointed that they hadn't been called up by that point in time. I think Australians share many if not all of the traits and values of the Ukrainian people, so I call on this government to learn what it can from this war, feed that into the upcoming defence review so it's not just another talkfest and start arming our defence forces with everything they need to defeat an autocratic, aggressive force. I wrote for the Lowy Institute before the invasion:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Of course, if Europe does not stand up to Russia in Ukraine, a clear message will be delivered to China on the question of strategic ambiguity over Taiwan. It will signal that the West does not have the strength—or the will—to defend smaller liberal democracies and that, if you push hard enough, the West will capitulate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that point is arguable more now than it was then. This is not something that we can allow to happen here in our region, and we should be doing more and more to assist the Ukrainians to defeat the Russian army, push them back over the borders and restore the rules based order.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:03</span>):  Housing is not a commodity or an investment; it is in fact a human right. Every Australian deserves to have the security of a safe place to sleep and to live without the worry of eviction. No-one should have to deal with the anxiety of whether their landlord will take the opportunity to raise the rent this week or whether this will be the week that their landlord decides that they want to renovate and in so doing evict them. Australians are facing an unprecedented housing crisis right now. Homes are more unaffordable than they have ever been, and inflation is driving up the cost of living and has made mortgages unsustainable. If you are a renter, it is even worse. My office and I have heard story after story of people being priced out of their rental homes due to the greed of landlords trying to exploit what they see as a quick profit.</span>

In my hometown of Perth, the vacancy rate on rental properties is just one per cent. Those numbers, if you can imagine it, get even worse in regional towns like Bunbury, Albany and Broome. This has empowered landlords and rental agencies to increase rent by literally hundreds of dollars. With 50 people or more attending open homes every week, rental bidding is all too commonplace. The devastating impact of this unsustainable and exploitative market has been dire. People have been forced to sleep in their cars, on friends' couches or on the street just to get by.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a catastrophic situation. The worst of it is that it is avoidable. As members of this place, it is our collective responsibility to regulate the market, and the only good market is one that works for all Australians. That is why the Australian Greens are calling for an immediate freeze on rents and rent increases. It is not even unprecedented to take this approach, to freeze rent increases. It is something in fact that the Scottish government agreed to do just recently. In their most recent budget update, they have executed a complete freeze on rent increases and evictions until 2023. The Australian government has even done it. During World War II, rents indeed were frozen. It's time for the government to side with workers, with people and with renters and immediately freeze rent increases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the broader and urgently needed affordable, accessible and inclusive housing agenda, we as a community and the federal and state governments have a fantastic opportunity before us. There is a little known process going on right now by which Australia is recreating its National Construction Code. As part of that review process, the states and territories have been given the opportunity to embrace new sustainable housing construction code guidelines and new accessible and inclusive construction guidelines, particularly for residential properties—houses, rentals et cetera.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am really pleased and proud to say that it's the Greens here in the ACT that champion inclusive design standards at the national level. So far, the majority of states and territories have bought into that system and have agreed that from 12 months time every home constructed will be accessible for disabled people—that is, every state except two: one is my state of Western Australia; the other is New South Wales. The Greens will continue to push until WA comes onboard with inclusive design standards.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="SR5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DODSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  This week I was moved by the first speeches of our new colleagues. A senator's first speech is a unique insight into their character. But when you listen to several, as I have this week, it is impossible not to realise that they hold a common thread across the political divide. They reflect a shared desire that our time in this chamber will leave a country in a better place. Despite the cynical public view sometimes, most of us occupy our places here because we want to do good. We want to contribute to the difficult but rewarding work of nation-building. We want to shape a fairer, more just and freer society. We want to look back, when our time comes to be done with this place, and tell our children, our grandchildren and their grandchildren that we were a part of putting things right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those of us in this 47th Parliament will be asked to make a choice on one such issue of nation-building—whether or not to support a referendum on a voice to parliament. As envisaged in the Uluru Statement from the Heart, the Voice to Parliament is a modest and generous invitation to the nation. Out of the torment of our powerlessness, it weaves a simple and hopeful suggestion for a way forward. It proposes a First Nations representative body to advise the parliament on the laws and policies that will impact upon their lives, and it proposes that this body, the Voice, be enshrined in the Constitution to ensure it has a place of recognition, responsibility and contribution into the future. Importantly, the Voice is not the work of the Labor government or any other political party. It is the culmination of decades of advocacy by First Nations people and their leaders. There is a clear line from the advocacy of early leaders such as William Cooper, the 1938 Day of Mourning, the 1963 Yirrkala bark petitions and the 1988 Barunga Statement to the regional dialogue processes that birthed the Uluru Statement from the Heart. The process brought together over 1,200 First Nations delegates in 12 regional dialogues across the country. The final convention at Uluru resulted in a historic consensus around the proposal for a voice. It was the largest consensus of First Nations' people on a proposal for recognition in Australian history. It is about recognition in the Constitution and it is also about practical outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a long history, and we know it, of failed government programs, broken promises and waste. Everyone knows that. A voice means that First Nations people, the people who know what works, will advise the parliament in a focused and consistent manner about laws that impact their lives. It is about shaping better policies and strategies that make a practical difference. It is about getting it right for the first time. It is about giving a constant voice to the people who don't have one. It is not the end of the road. It is not the only thing we need to do. But it is the next significant nation-building step in our journey towards reconciliation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own first speech I made a commitment to work with my fellow senators to build a better country—a stronger, just and inclusive Australia. As I hear the new colleagues across the chamber express similar sentiments I feel hopeful that, together, we can play our part in responding positively to the generous invitation of the First Nations people contained in the Uluru Statement from the Heart, for a voice.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUGHES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:13</span>):  Yesterday I made a two-minute speech with regard to the trip to Israel that I took under AIJAC, the Australia/Israel &amp; Jewish Affairs Council, and some of the disturbing things we learnt when visiting Ramallah and meeting with the Palestinian Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I began to touch upon some appalling behaviour that has apparently been endorsed by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the ABC. Fouad AbuGosh has worked for the ABC since 2004 and in fact, even more appallingly, won a Walkley award in 2016 for his reporting from Syria—but we know what the status of the Walkley awards are in this current day and age. He has now deleted his Twitter account. It is important to note that, prior to deleting this account, just a week or so, AbuGosh's official title on his Twitter account read: 'Middle East producer for Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Opinions are mine and ABC's.' I think the ABC potentially has some questions to answer, because last year AbuGosh warned that 'there is a great Zionist project to dominate and control all Arabs in the region'. That sounds very anti-Israel to me. Is that the view of the ABC? But it gets worse. Surprisingly, it gets worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In April this year, there were further posts in response to a screenshot of an Israeli policeman detaining an unidentified civilian. I was lucky enough to be in Israel just last week. Those of us who have experienced Israel, who understand where the borders are and what is occurring within the different areas—particularly around Jerusalem, Bethlehem, the different parts of Temple Mount, all of the old city of Jerusalem and the very holy lands—know that what is portrayed in the media is not necessarily what is actually going on. Never let the facts get in the way of a good story, particularly in the ABC!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to that photo—and apparently this is the view of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation—AbuGosh tweeted:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This is how the Nazis treated the Jews, maybe it's time for....!!!!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To me, that is up there with one of the most appalling things you could possibly say. But this is the view of the Israeli correspondent in the Middle East, who, on his Twitter account—until it was recently deleted—determined that these were not only his views but the views of the ABC. David Anderson, Ita Buttrose and the rest of the ABC deserve to give every Australian who pays for this organisation an explanation. They deserve to let all Australians who fund them—not only Jewish Australians, not only our friends in Israel—know if these are their views. It seems to me that they are going out of their way to ensure that they alienate huge sections of the community and contribute to the misinformation that is consistently being peddled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will touch on another issue very briefly, and I'm sure I will come back to this. One of the things that we heard whilst in meetings in Israel is this new piece of propaganda that somehow Israel is a state of apartheid. This emanates from an antiracism conference in Durban which was deliberately put there in coordination with a group of Arab states and the Palestine Liberation Army. The PLO and Arab states put together an antiracism conference in Durban, and somehow they compare Israel—Israel is the most inclusive state, as those who have ever been there know.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the people we met with, who is absolutely amazing, is an Arab citizen of Israel. He's been a journalist there for over 38 years, and he said that he was incredibly grateful to live in Israel. I would have thought that, if you're an Arab Israeli and this is really a state of apartheid, that's probably not where you'd want to be. As I said, I'm going to come back to this. Amnesty International has used a definition of apartheid that has never been signed by a Western nation—it was actually only developed by the USSR—to claim that Israel is an apartheid state. Amnesty International is discredited. It is disgraceful, and the ABC owes us an explanation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Jacqui Lambie Network Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:18</span>):  The Tamar is in a shocking state. Launceston should be living on a river of gold; instead, it's a river full of mud and poo. It's sad to say it but it's true. I hate to imagine the stuff that's floating around in that water. I cringe at the idea of going for a swim. Those signs that say 'no fishing' and 'no swimming' are on the money. You wouldn't dip a toe in there most days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what we're doing to Tassie's clean, green image. The Tamar is brown. It's brown for all the wrong reasons. The grass creates big, dirty mudflats that destroy breeding grounds for our birds and wildlife. You can hardly get a kayak out there because the mudflats are impossible to bring a boat over. I have no idea where I'll take my lab, Charlie, for a dip. If he ever jumps in the river he'll look like a completely different dog.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These problems are way worse than can be fixed with another task force talkfest like federal Labor is saying, and we need to do better than a bit of extra dredging like the Tassie government is doing. Dredging might tidy things up for a little while, but the locals know that the silt and mud come back in the blink of an eye.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Together, Liberal and Labor's so-called 10-year plan is to clean up five or six hectares of wetlands, when we've lost 100. We still have no idea when they're even going to get started. This thing has been going on for yonks, and we're still tinkering around the edges. Why don't you get it, you guys? Doing little bits and pieces is never going to work. It'll never get you anywhere. You're changing the spark plugs while your engine is broken. These kinds of problems don't get solved by going around the edges. It's time for action to hit the bullseye.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I reckon we should look at a barrage—gates that open when the tide goes out and close when the tide comes in. It flushes the water and pollution out to the ocean and stops it flowing back. We'd have a freshwater lake where the polluted river is now. Trust me, barrages create beautiful waterways. The Tamar's muddy low tides would be a thing of the past. Think Adelaide, Canberra and Singapore, with clean and pretty waterways that people want to be around. We'd also get flood control. We could empty the lake down to Bass Strait and close the gates to stop the tides going upriver to Launceston and inundating the place. Yes, a barrage costs money, but it makes money, too. For a start, we could sell the fresh water to irrigators and hydrogen energy operators, rather than building a ridiculous 50-kilometre pipeline to Lake Trevallyn. Even better, we'd bring in more tourist dollars. All the fresh water would kill off all the bloody rice grass and give us lakeside beaches so that Launnie tourism would get a boost. I bet all those little caravan parks and hotels would love to catch a break after the few years they've had.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a big idea, but that's what we need. The river's been stuffed for years. Will Hodgman set up a task force in 2017 and promised that things would get better. Peter Gutwein put money aside for more dredging before the last state election—money that still hasn't been spent. Now the federal Labor Party are chipping us over a few bucks to tidy up things here and there. It's all too slow, too little, too timid. As usual, the politicians talk and talk while the rest of us are left up the creek without a paddle.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="259819" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:21</span>):  I am very pleased to finally have the opportunity to rise in this place and talk about the Jobs and Skills Summit that was held in parliament last week. I'm particularly keen to talk about  not only the events that were held and the discussions that took place in Canberra but also the work that was done in the lead-up to the summit, which I think goes to the power of the summit itself. As we know, many members of the government held round tables in the lead-up to the summit. By setting a date and telling the rest of the country that we would put everyone in a room and tell them that we wanted solutions on the table, we found that people started to come together—people from all walks of life, people who do not necessarily agree with each other all the time, people who might have different views about what we need to do to fix some of the challenges. But holding the summit itself led to outcomes before the summit even began, and after the summit we saw 36 concrete, meaningful outcomes that came from the agreements before and during those discussions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For my part, in the lead-up to the summit, I was determined to make sure that the unique views of people in regional Queensland were heard and were part of the discussions. I live in Cairns. I am based in Far North Queensland. There are many different diverse communities all across regional Queensland. I wanted the opportunity to hear from just a few of those communities in the lead-up to the summit. So, over one week before the summit was held I held three regional round tables in regional Queensland, across three different electorates. And I have to say that they were very well attended and I really appreciated the effort and enthusiasm that people brought to these opportunities. From Mareeba in the Atherton Tablelands to Townsville and to Cairns, I heard from diverse, passionate Queenslanders who are working hard for their communities. Everybody who came to the summit understood that we weren't going to be able to solve every problem there and then. But they were there with ideas and with a contribution, with an understanding that their feedback would be taken into the summit itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was very good to see that a number of regional Queenslanders were present at the summit. We know that there were mayors. Mayor Ann Baker from Moranbah was there. Professor Allan Dale, who is based in Far North Queensland but chaired one of our round tables in Cairns, had the opportunity to attend the summit in Canberra. So there were people in the room from regional Australia, but I definitely wanted to make sure that these views were heard and were delivered to the Treasurer and the task force secretary. In many of the same ways that many of my Senate colleagues and MPs in the other place did, I joined in listening to communities in the lead-up to this opportunity to make sure that these voices were heard. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we heard was resoundingly clear. From Mareeba all the way through to Townsville and Cairns, we heard that there have been 10 long years of wages going backwards and not keeping up with the cost of living. Queenslanders understand that our challenge does not end with just getting people into work; we also have an opportunity to make sure that workers are treated with respect and paid a fair day's wage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone at the summit recognised that our industrial relations system is desperately in need of an update, and that is coming from businesses and workers alike. Workers and businesses told me that workplace laws were too complicated, and I was pleased to see agreement between business and union groups over the summit itself, demonstrating a commitment to work together in Australia's national interest. While we still need to work through what the details of these plans will look like, there is definitely consensus, not only through the government but with businesses, with industry, with unions, with employers and with workers on the front line, that we need to have a look at our workplace laws to make sure they are fit and proper for the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, in regional Queensland, our tourism and agricultural industries indicated that the skilled labour shortage has disrupted migration settings, meaning that they experience concerning labour shortages. Just as it has been difficult to attract workers to regional Queensland, it is equally hard to retain them in the current conditions. Vital community infrastructure like housing, health and internet are central to keeping regional towns afloat. We are hearing all too often that, without community infrastructure and services, workers see no incentive in making a regional place their home. So we need to make sure that, if we are encouraging workers to come to regional Queensland, they will certainly have the infrastructure and services needed to make sure they want to live there, and to raise their families there as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think Minister Gallagher summed it up perfectly when she said that 'women nailed it' at the summit. So did women across regional Queensland. I'm very proud that at my round tables in regional Queensland we had a lot of women around the table, and they were telling me that the cost of child care and parental leave issues are causing them to make the decision to leave the workforce or to work fewer hours than they would like to. When we are in desperate need of workers to revive and grow our economy, we must look at ways to clear every obstacle that women face in entering and staying in decent work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, a more detailed summary of the North and Far North Queensland contribution to the Jobs and Skills Summit was delivered to the Treasurer and the task force secretary. I was very pleased to have the opportunity to meet with the Treasurer, Jim Chalmers, to talk with him directly about these issues. He is certainly no stranger to regional Queensland, but it was important to make sure that the regional issues that we were talking about weren't lost on the national scale. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to be a member of a government that seeks to find common ground and invites cooperation so that we can reap the benefits of reform. It is very clear that the Jobs and Skills Summit was a success. I can understand those opposite wanting to talk down the success of the Jobs and Skills Summit, because, unfortunately, they failed to turn up. They failed to understand that this was not a moment for politics but a moment for our country—a moment to deal with a lot of the issues that we are facing, come together, put aside differences and build a consensus on how we can move forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether it is the cost of living, whether it is skills shortages, whether it is getting women back into work after childbirth, it is important that everyone around the table shares the same concern to make sure that these issues are dealt with by a reforming government—a government that cares about people, a government that is focused on delivering jobs in places like regional Queensland, and a government that is crystal clear that it will always put the national interest ahead of political interest. That is what was on display at the Jobs and Skills Summit, and I couldn't have been prouder to be a part of a Labor government on those days.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">ALSH</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  Today, early childhood educators are walking off the job, and their message to us is clear: give us a reason to stay in our jobs and pay us what we are worth; value early learning properly as part of our education system and put children before profit. To the early educators who are taking this action today I want to say that I stand with you. I stand with you because the work that you do is completely essential, I stand with you because you are completely undervalued for that work and I stand with you because I know you've tried absolutely everything to be respected for the work that you do and that this is the only action that you have left to take in order to be heard.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Early educators are absolutely essential. Early educators are qualified. You are dedicated. You are professional. You provide a play-based learning experience that is tailored to the unique needs of every child. You are incredible, you do incredible work and you are completely undervalued and underpaid for the work you do—completely; $22 an hour is an absolute joke. To literally hold the nation's future in their hands, we cannot ask educators to continue educating our nation's children when they can barely earn enough to support their own, so I stand with educators who are walking off the job today. I know it's a tough decision that you have taken, I know our industrial system is completely broken for you and I know this is the only way that you can be heard, and we hear you loud and clear.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  History tells us that civilisations and empires are transitory. There are increasing signs now that Western culture has reached a tipping point. Left-wing activism supposedly based on equity, diversity and inclusion uses its allies in the media, the corporate sector and politics to prohibit any views it disapproves of. Too many of our modern leaders are not across this threat. They seem to think that defending our values is beneath them and that we have time on our side. We do not. Suicide and depression rates in our young people continue to skyrocket. We've failed to instil in them a sense of meaning and purpose, replacing it with empty modern ideologies like climate alarmism. On leaving school, young adults have little knowledge of history, the result of a curriculum denuded of Western history, replaced by critical race theory and a sense of victimhood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, too many have cowered before these ideologies, afraid of being called the various isms and phobias, and they're wreaking havoc across the West. If a principled defence of liberty was ever needed in this country, it was over the past 2½ years, yet we were told that those concerned with freedom were dangerous extremists. We need more brave men and women to stand up for future generations of Australians and hand them a culture that is greater than the one left to us. The relative prosperity and peace we've enjoyed have allowed us to become complacent, thinking that such a decline couldn't happen here, but the time has come for our leaders to stand up for what is right. Without urgent, strong leadership the West is doomed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New Sou</span><span class="HPS-Electorate">th Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  Today I want to give a shout-out to unionists and the union movement. Over the last few months, in New South Wales alone, we've seen the strength and energy of educators; nurses and midwives; rail, tram and bus workers; and university staff and students, amongst many other unionists. Yesterday we felt that energy from TAFE unionists on National TAFE Day. Today the lawns of parliament are full of early childhood educators who have shut down the sector for the day, closing centres and rallying around the country to draw attention to the impact of their terrible pay and conditions—conditions made much worse by a critical workforce shortage. The solidarity shown in the movement and from the public for each of these actions has been tremendous. As a lifelong unionist myself, I could not be more proud of and inspired by all of this work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens recognise the vital place of unions in our society and will continue to fight alongside them for fair pay and conditions. We will keep joining you on the pickets and do everything we can in this place to unwind the decade of union-busting, worker-undermining garbage of the former Liberal government. We will push the new government to give workers real power to organise, bargain, grow and participate fully in your workplaces and communities. I am with you all the way. All the Greens are right with you in fighting for your rights and conditions. There has never been a more important time to join your union. Collectively, we can change the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do have a bit of time, so I want to address the matter that was before the parliament just a minute ago. In this parliament, racism is thrown around so easily, and the people who call it out are the people who are penalised. When will this chamber and this parliament actually seriously consider the Jenkins report and the behaviour standards in this chamber, and actually act on them and not keep shouting down and shutting up people who actually call out bad behaviour and racism?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  Today is Early Childhood Educators Day, where we get to celebrate every single early educator across our country for the absolutely life-changing work that they do. But these educators have been doing it tough. Through the height of the pandemic and beyond, they have not been valued in the way that they should be for the vital work that they do each and every single day. They are not appreciated enough and they're not paid enough. So it's no surprise today that thousands of these workers are walking off the job to stand up for their wages and conditions at work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am here in the Senate today standing in solidarity with these workers. If I were in Adelaide, I would be joining my son and my daughter's carers as they walked out of their centre. I would be standing with them because I value them. More than that, like many families across Australia, I depend on them and I adore them. They are an extension of our family, and I know they deserve so much more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our industrial system has been failing these workers. It's failed to deliver the pay rises that these workers deserve. Like workers right across our care economy, workers in female dominated industries have been let down by the current industrial system and are unable to access the right compensation for the incredible work they do, the essential work they do. I know the answers aren't always simple here, but I want every early educator in Australia to know that I am advocating for you every step of the way. I see the work that you do as an extension of the families who place their trust in you, and also what you do for our nation. The work you do with our littlest and most precious minds is fundamentally important to our success as a country. We value you and we see you. Thank you for the work you do. I know it's a tough decision to walk off the job today, but we understand and are in solidarity.</span>

We had Heddon Greta Speedway across the road and a drive-in just a kilometre or two down the road. With the energy of youth, life was great, and all of those locations were visited more than once. I walked the speedway track and imagined myself racing around it. But the speedway closed long ago, and the track turned into housing, because change happens and change is inevitable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today it has been advised that the director is about to call cut on the other local icon, the Heddon Greta Drive-In. It has survived bushfires, floods and global pandemics, with its facilities used for COVID testing at the virus's peak, but it cannot beat change. It cannot fight time, and notice has been given that the metaphorical curtains will be closing, with a development application for more housing to be lodged. Whilst the facility has been around since before my recollection, it most recently came to life under Scott Sneddon, who reopened the turnstiles in 1996 with a double feature of <span style="font-style:italic;">Babe</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Apollo 13</span>. Since that evening in March, it reintroduced itself as a cornerstone of local entertainment amongst those with a strong car culture in the Hunter Valley. With the iconic advertising slogan of 'If you don't like the movie you can slash your seats,' young lovers, families that couldn't be bothered dressing up to go out and groups of friends all attended. It was more than a movie; it was an event. There was no more jumping into boots or burying kids under blankets to dodge a ticket, as we paid per car and had a ball. Thank you, Scottie, for bringing this back into our lives. Good luck in your development and good luck in finding a site for a proposal to construct the new facility.</span>

We like to call it the 'rugged wilderness' and, my goodness, most of you people in here would not survive over its border, I can assure you—that is where we have drop bears! To the people in Tullah: it was great to see you guys. It is great to see tourism really starting to pop down there again. To the people of Rosebery and the Ochre Medical Centre: you are doing a wonderful job. It is great to hear that you finally have a wonderful new GP down there servicing that area—I know that the people of Rosebery are very grateful, because her husband is a great football player. He is playing for Toorak down there and that is giving the doctor a whole new standing in that community, which is very entertaining in itself.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to thank the people in Queenstown. I can tell you, 12 months ago, 18 months ago, it was frightening. Twelve months ago, 70 per cent of the shops were closed. When I went down there this time, there were two shops closed and they look like they have new lease signs on them. That is fabulous. It is going great guns down there. I can see the new mountain bike track is starting to draw the attention of the tourists. You will have the walking track that should be built over the next couple of years. We understand you also have a housing issue. I ask that the mines get back to the table, talk about those housing issues down there and start seeing what they can do to provide houses for workers and their families. We need those workers and their families there. We do not want to see DIDOs—drive in, drive out. That is what is going to make these communities function in the long run, so it would be lovely to see that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do apologise to the people of Strachan. I did not get to see you this time. I also want to thank the mayor and the general manager on the West Coast for the time they give us to fill us in on what is going on on the West Coast. To West Coast people: thank you very much.</span>

Our early educators have a mammoth task on their hands every day they go to work. Not only do they care for our youngest Australians, allowing parents across the country to go out and participate in their own jobs and build the economy, they also do an incredibly important job of giving our youngest Australians the very best start to their education. Yet this predominantly female workforce is seriously undervalued and underpaid, and they are tired. Educators are leaving the sector in droves but today, in just a few hours, educators will stand right outside this place and speak up for their worth. They will speak out about the unjust way that they have been treated for far too long, and I and my colleagues are proud to stand with them</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government understands that the current early childhood education system is not working for educators, which means it is not working for families, which means it is not working for our economy, and we want to see that fixed. We know that, beyond praise, educators need and deserve better wages and conditions. Their pay packets should reflect the important and very skilled work that they perform every single day. We know that a lot needs to be done to reform this sector, but childhood educators across the country can rest assured that we see you, we stand with you and we will deliver for you. Congratulations on the very important step that you are taking today. We want to make sure that you understand that we stand here in solidarity with you and the important work that you do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  It's well known that Western Australia is blessed with an abundance of natural resources—iron ore, oil and gas in particular—and the Western Australian mining sector has benefited Australia's economy for decades. Western Australia is being presented with new opportunities and has the potential to take part in an industry that is gaining global momentum. I speak of hydrogen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I met with the team at the Dampier to Bunbury pipeline. The Dampier to Bunbury pipeline stretches 1,539 kilometres and pipes 845 terajoules of natural gas each day, from which natural gas fuels approximately 50 per cent of WA's energy needs. With changing energy demands globally, AGIG, the operator of the pipeline, are working on a plan to start blending hydrogen with natural gas. They aim to have a 10 per cent hydrogen and natural gas blend by 2030. This is the first step towards adapting our current gas infrastructure to carry only hydrogen by 2040.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even more exciting is that, with the production of hydrogen in northern WA and the infrastructure to move it, we open up opportunities to export hydrogen to global energy markets. This is about seizing market opportunities. It's not some woke pursuit of ideology and reckless abandonment of reliable low-cost energy. We must continue to invest in traditional energy sources while exploiting every opportunity to establish new markets with new sources of energy. So I look forward to working with Western Australian companies and industry to explore the opportunities that hydrogen can bring, whilst also supporting those traditional businesses that need to continue to export their resources so that we can bring energy not only to Australia but indeed to the world.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Acting Deputy President. First Nations people in this country are the oldest living continuing culture in the world. We are sovereign to our lands, waters, skies and totems. This is sovereignty. Violent colonial invaders never sought an agreement to live peacefully alongside us. The colonisers say that they are sovereign. We say that we are sovereign. Treaty is an agreement to share sovereignty.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">First Nations people have always fought for the right to make our own decisions when it comes to our people, our culture and our country. In the 1930s, Yorta Yorta man William Cooper petitioned King George V for Aboriginal seats in parliament. In 1963, the Yirrkala bark petitions called for land rights. In 1988, the Barunga Statement called for self-determination. In response, Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke promised to begin working on a treaty by 1990. Now, the states have taken up this Labor visionary's work. Victoria, Queensland and the Northern Territory all have treaties in the works.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you know who suggested we change the Constitution? John Howard! In the lead-up to the 2007 election, John Howard promised that the coalition would hold a referendum to recognise Indigenous Australians in the preamble of the Constitution. Why is Prime Minister Albanese following John Howard's lead? Why is the Prime Minister out of step with the Labor governed states?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Treaty is not an overnight process, which is all the more reason to start laying the groundwork now at the federal level. Treaty is an opportunity to celebrate this nation together. It's an opportunity to unite and mature.</span>

Decades of Greens, Liberal, Labor and Nationals policies slowly destroying our country caused the cost-of-living crisis.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In just three months under the coalition, groceries got five per cent more expensive, an increase of 20 per cent per year. Fuel prices will jump again when Labor cancels the 22c-a-litre tax discount. Wholesale power prices are at record highs and will flow through to power bills. That's why Labor quietly crab-walked away from their election promise to reduce your power bills by $275. Both sides take turns to gradually destroy our country. Both forced intermittent wind and solar pipedreams, driving up power prices. High power prices make everything else more expensive.</span>

That supercharged demand, the culprit in runaway inflation—neither side will talk about it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor now plans an immigration flood. Two hundred thousand new arrivals each year will drive up demand for housing and services, making costs of living worse. This is the difference between keeping lights on and sitting in the dark; between eating healthy groceries and walking down the supermarket canned-goods aisle; between new school uniforms and sending children off to school with holes in their socks; between a roof over our heads and being out on the street.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, One Nation policies will build an environment making our economy stronger. Stable breadwinner jobs will flourish. Our policies will unlock Australia's abundant natural resources so we can be the world's energy superpower, as we should be. One Nation policies will return Australia to having the world's cheapest power bills. We are one community. We have one flag. We are one nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  I rise today to speak about vaccine injuries and the lack of help from the Albanese Labor government to those injured by the COVID vaccine. I receive many stories of people being injured every day, and they are seeking help. I've been contacted by one constituent whose wife suffered an extreme systemic reaction to her first AZ dose. She had multiple trips to her GP as her condition worsened, and two trips to emergency prior to paralysis episodes from GBS. She was then taken by ambulance and admitted to hospital in June 2021. She suffered a brain bleed and brain inflammation. She was subsequently diagnosed with multiple conditions, all attributed to her reaction to AZ. These conditions have lingered for 15 months and have been linked to acute onset lymphoedema and severe hypokalaemia, which have left her with severe permanent disabilities, including an acquired brain injury, and ongoing chronic conditions that need constant care and treatment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The couple has provided evidence to the indemnity scheme, including five letters from her GP, hospital admissions, one letter from a medical registrar, another letter from a consultant physician and clinical immunologist, a letter from another immunologist, another letter from a neurologist, another letter from a haematologist and another letter from a neurologist. Despite all of that evidence and these experts saying that her injury was caused by the vaccine, the indemnity scheme has refused her claim. It's not a lot; it's only $20,000 topped out. Yet this couple is suffering severely. I'm calling on the Albanese Labor government and the health minister, as well as the Minister for Social Services, to do the right thing and look after these people.</span>

I have to say how pleased I was with this technology. As someone who has had gestational diabetes, I found that the test where you have to fast and then pump yourself up on sugar to then come crashing down was a horrible experience. But this technology is a terrific replacement for that. I really want to see this point-of-care testing become more accessible to the Australian people so that women, and anyone who needs to do one of those other horrible tests, are able to do a much more rapid and accessible test where appropriate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this should be affordable because it is simply replacing a different kind of test in our Medicare subsidies, so I very much look forward to this technology being more widely available. Currently, for example, it can take a long time for test results to get to and from remote communities. Where we've got a high burden of disease—for example, in some remote Indigenous communities—it would be terrific to be able to see this technology diagnose high blood sugar levels there and then on the spot, so people can get their diabetes diagnosed and therefore protect their lives and their kidneys. It was an entirely pain-free, easy experience, and I very much want to thank Pathology Technology Australia for being here in parliament today.</span>

I appreciate his interest in Solomon Islands. Obviously, it's a matter of record what occurred in relation to the Solomon Islands under the previous government. I'm asked about electoral assistance. I would make the point—and he may not be aware of this—that Australia has actually been providing electoral assistance to Solomon Islands for many years, on the proprieties of both governments, so obviously the question goes to: when did the Australian government become aware of capacity to engage in an election? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would make the point that Australia has, in fact, been providing assistance for the democratic processes in Solomon Islands for years. We are already partnering with the Solomon Islands electoral office to support electoral reform and administration, through both the Australian Electoral Commission's program and the UNDP's program, aimed at strengthening the electoral cycle in Solomon Islands. Australia has always taken the view that democracy, democratic processes and democracy matter. I would reiterate the standing offer the Australian government has to support the Solomon Islands next election, whether held in 2023 or 2024. Obviously, as I've made clear publicly, the timing of the election is entirely a matter for the government and parliament of Solomon Islands. I would assume that my colleague Senator Birmingham would share the view that democracy matters, that democratic conventions are important and that Australia's support for democratic processes through the Pacific, including Solomon Islands, is a matter for bipartisan support. </span>

I would again go back to my primary answer, which is that there has been a longstanding practice of governments of both political persuasions to provide support for democratic processes in Solomon Islands. As I said, we recently provided support for PNG, and I think some of those opposite may have been invited to observe the election process. We will support Solomon Islands next election, whether held in 2023 or 2024. I would indicate to the Senate that, obviously, this is an offer that has been reiterated on more than one occasion, including by Minister Conroy as well as by officials. </span>

Today's national accounts reflect an economy that's rebounding from the disruption of the pandemic but is being held back by capacity constraints, skills shortages and declining real wages. This is a familiar story that we are seeing, certainly familiar in terms of the economy and the economic challenges that we inherited on forming government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the headline figures are encouraging, the data released today confirm the pressures that are being felt by Australian households and that are weighing on our supply chains. The national accounts figures released today show that the economy grew by 0.9 per cent in the June quarter 2022 to be 3.6 per cent higher through the year. GDP increased 3.9 per cent over the 2021-22 financial year. That growth reflected the continuing pandemic recovery and was concentrated in the services industry, particularly as this was the first full quarter of reopened domestic and international borders since the pandemic began some two years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The quarterly increase was driven by increases in household consumption, which was 2.2 per cent, net exports and new business investment, partly offset by inventories and dwelling investment. In particular, household consumption grew by 2.2 per cent in the quarter. It was, I think, six per cent higher through the year and contributed 1.1 percentage points to real GDP growth in the quarter. The household savings ratio fell to 8.7 per cent in June, down from 11.1 per cent in March. Dwelling investment fell as most states continued to experience material and labour shortages, and industries detracted from growth, driven by drawdowns from the mining industry and from agriculture.</span>

The Albanese government's economic plan is a plan to boost productivity, take the speed limit off the economy, particularly in some of the data we are seeing in the national accounts today, and build up the right kind of growth to make a meaningful difference on cost-of-living pressures for households, without adding to inflationary pressures. A key element of this was last week's Jobs and Skills Summit, where we saw representatives from across the country come together with 36 concrete outcomes to help deal with the issues that we face. I was particularly proud of the emphasis on women during the summit, with agreement that improving women's workforce participation is critical for Australia's future economic prosperity and resilience. Of course, there are also our plans on cleaner and cheaper energy, better training and skilling our workforce, investing in cheaper child care, upgrading the NBN to better capture digital economic opportunity and creating a future made in Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Our economic plan will address the challenges that are facing us. We know that these challenges have been made worse by nearly a decade of wasted opportunities and wrong priorities from those opposite. Our policies will put the national interest first, whether it is through our climate change policy that will address opportunities for investment, innovation and jobs, or whether it is through addressing the skills shortages that are affecting different areas of the economy, particularly through our fee-free TAFE policies as well as measures we announced in the Jobs and Skills Summit last week, such as increasing the permanent migration ceiling to 195,000 for this financial year. Also, of course, there is our very significant investment of over $5 billion to make child care cheaper, which will make child care more affordable for families, improve productivity and improve workforce participation.</span>

The Albanese government's decision to expand the distribution priority area classifications to include suburbs of capital cities means that towns like Mildura are now competing with the suburbs of Melbourne for overseas doctors. The only bulk-billing medical practice in Mildura has had to close because doctors can now move back to the city and have chosen to do so, leaving 15,000 patients wondering how they will receive adequate medical care in Mildura and the Sunraysia area. Will the minister apologise to the Mildura community for effectively cutting their health services?</span>

The issues of bulk billing are serious. Access to high-quality primary care—if you can't get it, that creates problems downstream in the healthcare system.

The cost-of-living crisis that this government inherited is a decade in the making and it will not be solved overnight, but the Albanese government has already hit the ground running, successfully arguing for an increase in the minimum wage—something not argued under those opposite—introducing legislation which will drive investment in cleaner cheaper energy and putting downward pressure on power prices, also something you could never see from a coalition government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we are introducing legislation to make medicine cheaper for millions of Australians. For the first time in its 75-year history, the maximum cost of general scripts under the PBS will fall. On 1 January we are cutting the cost of general scripts by 29 per cent, with the maximum cost to drop by $12 50, dropping the price from $42.50 to $30. This will save someone taking one medication $150 year; a family with two or three medications, $300 to $450 a year. We know patients continue to tell community pharmacies of the increasing pressures of having to choose between food on the table and medicine for their family.</span>

Those of us on this side understand that making medicines cheaper will ease the squeeze on household budgets for so many Australians. But another difference between us and them is that we on this side understand that Medicare and the PBS are the foundations of Australia's world-class healthcare system. And do you know why we understand that? Because they're Labor reforms. They're both initiatives of Labor governments, and it is only Labor governments that make these nation-building reforms to transform the lives of Australians: the PBS, a legacy of the Curtin and Chifley governments, and, of course, Medicare, a legacy of the Hawke government. This government will continue to strengthen both Medicare and the PBS. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I understand that the senator—it's one of those situations. I will think through if I can provide an explanation that makes it clearer than that, but to me the words 'net zero' are quite clear. I think we all understand what 'net emissions' means. I am reminded of a time when I was climate minister and I think Senator Fielding wanted an explanation, and I got in the Chief Scientist to try and take him through it, and we did get to a point where I thought, 'I don't actually know'—and neither did she at that time—'how to break it down any further.' But I will have a think about that. I think it's a commonly understood objective, and it's an objective, as the senator knows, that is shared by those opposite, I thought—maybe not.</span>

Maybe Senator Canavan is indicating a change of policy under the coalition, under Mr Dutton.

I don't know whether I should actually ask a second one—now you've got me! All right, then: how much will the government policy to reduce emissions by 43 per cent—and you don't know what net zero is anyway—by 2030, I would really like to know how much it's going to cost the government by 2050. But I doubt I'm going to get an answer on the first one. If you can answer my question: how much is it going to cost the Australian taxpayers to reduce emissions by 43 per cent? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

She may be aware that the Labor Party in opposition did model this 43 per cent reduction by 2030 policy and issued the modelling transparently. That modelling showed that the plan, which includes a 43 per cent reduction, would in fact: create 604,000 jobs, with five out of six new jobs to be created in the region; would spur $76 billion dollars of investment; and would deliver 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030. What we have seen is generating capacity exiting the energy generation system over the life of the government of those opposite. That reduction in supply without new capacity coming onstream is central to why power prices are doing what they are doing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Tim</span><span style="font-style:italic;">e expired)</span></span>

But the focus will be on permanent skilled migration, and that will add to the capacity of the Australian economy. It's important to recall that one of the things that we all have to do and Australia will have to do is to ensure, with the link between GDP and populations and emissions, that they are delinked and that we can continue to grow our economy in ways that don't continue to produce as many emissions. The way we do that is by the sorts of investments in renewable energy that our plan will deliver. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time </span><span style="font-style:italic;">expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Thank you, President. I thank the senator for her intervention. As I made very clear in the few seconds I had to answer this question before I was rudely interrupted by Senator Reynolds, we are going to do more in the time that we have in the government than your government did in the previous 10 years. These are issues that are, of course, constantly under review by the Minister for Social Services.</span>

It's agonising that Minister Farrell can't get beyond the broad concept of pensioners and hasn't even turned to the actual policy proposal of the government— which is a copy of part of an opposition policy proposal—for an extension to pensioner work rights, when the precise question from Senator Reynolds was about those pensioner work rights and why the government has adopted it only to the end of the financial year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:41</span>):  My question is to Minister Watt, representing the Minister for Early Childhood Education. Today, thousands of early childhood educators around the country have walked out of centres. The low pay and difficult conditions these workers are subjected to are a national shame. Educators deserve professional pay that reflects the skill and responsibility of the work that they do every single day. But instead of immediately committing the funding necessary to lift these workers' wages, the Labor government is going ahead with the stage 3 tax cuts for the wealthy—tax cuts that economists tell us will overwhelmingly flow to men as well. Why is the government sticking with the obscene stage 3 tax cuts when it should be using the money to lift wages of early educators and carers, who are mostly women?</span>

                  </a>  Point of order: Senator Watt may well be quite willing to answer those bits within his portfolio, but a question on tax cuts, just because it is juxtaposed with a political statement about child care, does not make this part of the portfolio that Senator Watt is representing. If the senator wants to ask questions about tax cuts, there are representing ministers who can obviously be asked, but I make the point that the responsibility is not in the portfolio to which the question is addressed. Obviously, the remedy is the minister can answer the question insofar as it relates to the portfolio he's representing.</span>

Senator Wong, of course, is correct. If you go back and look at the question that was asked, it was about tax cuts; but I'm certainly happy to talk about early childhood educators, a group in our community that I and everyone on this side of the chamber very much value. It's particularly appropriate that we talk about these issues today because today is of course Early Childhood Educators Day. That's why, not long after question time, I and, no doubt, many of my colleagues here will be going to meet with early childhood educators on the front lawns of the parliament. I would certainly encourage every member of parliament to do the same thing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has long recognised the problems regarding the low pay of early childhood educators. I certainly know that from personal experience in terms of my children and the early childhood education they received. I've actually spent time in early childhood centres with educators, observing the work that they do, which is incredibly demanding and incredibly valuable—that's why they do deserve a pay rise. That's exactly why our government is committed to reinvigorating bargaining so that we can improve productivity but also grow wages, particularly in sectors like early childhood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why our government has successfully argued for a pay rise for the lowest-paid workers in Australia—a pay rise, I might admit and acknowledge, that those opposite opposed. On 1 July this year, the Fair Work Commission minimum rates order increased pay rates in modern awards, including the Children's Services Award, by 4.6 per cent. That's something our government called for in a submission: a pay rise for the lowest-paid workers in our community, including early childhood educators. We know the work of women has long been undervalued, and that is definitely the case for the early childhood education and care sector, where more than 90 per cent of the workforce are women, and we will keep acting on this. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The only party that will ever be responsible for delivering a wage rise to early childhood educators is a Labor government, and that is exactly what we are doing right now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This notion that we have given up on this issue could not be further from the truth. As I say, already since we have been in office, the Fair Work Commission minimum rates order increased pay rates in modern awards, including the children's services award, by 4.6 per cent. That of course followed the Labor government making a submission to the Fair Work Commission, arguing for a pay rise for those lowest paid amongst our community. I am very happy to put my credentials as a supporter of early childhood educators up against any member of the Greens and any member of the opposition. I know that everyone on this side of the chamber would do the same thing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It might suit the Greens frame to say that nothing is happening, but it has already happened, and we have been in office for barely 100 days. That's before we get to the changes to bargaining that we expect will make an even bigger difference to the lowest paid in a community, including childhood educators.</span>

Very few industries have had it as tough as the tourism and travel sector over the last couple of years. From bushfires and floods to the pandemic, the industry has weathered significant challenges which have impacted the businesses' ability to retain and to recruit staff. Those in the sector understand that skill shortages were an issue before the pandemic but were exacerbated by the ongoing uncertainty from and lack of action by the previous government. Hearing the voices of those in the sector and working together on solutions is and will continue to be a priority for the Albanese Labor government. </span>

It's true that the majority of tourism and travel businesses are small to medium sized in this country, with 95 per cent of all businesses employing fewer than five people—and that's particularly the case in the state of Tasmania.

As mentioned earlier, today, as a result of the Jobs and Skills Summit, I joined the Minister for Social Services, Amanda Rishworth, in announcing a $3.3 million visitor economy disability pilot to help people living with disability to secure and sustain jobs in tourism. The pilot will address barriers, as previously identified by small and medium-sized tourism businesses, in recruiting, retaining and progressing staff with disabilities. These include a lack of time and capability to recruit people living with disability; confusion on how and where to seek support; and employment services providers' focusing on supporting jobseekers only, rather than employers. We know that 88 per cent of people living with disability who work don't actually need modifications in the workplaces to do so.<span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It is the Prime Minister's expectation that ministers do comply with the code. He's made that clear both privately and publicly. I would also make the point that this is a higher standard than has been applied in the Commonwealth of Australia for nearly a decade. Obviously it's a different standard to the standard that was applied by those opposite. On that basis, I ask that further questions be placed on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister for Emergency Management</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:02</span>):  Senator Thorpe, I have some partial answers to your questions. I may have to come back with some further answers tomorrow. In relation to your first question, the Montgomery case that you were referring to follows some similar litigation, the Love and Thoms cases, which I'm sure you're familiar with. Since the High Court's judgement in Love and Thoms, and as at 29 August this year, 13 noncitizens have been released from immigration detention on the basis that they meet, or the detaining officer suspects they meet, the tripartite test. Five noncitizens have been released from immigration detention directly or indirectly as a result of court judgements concerning whether it was reasonable for officers to suspect that noncitizens were aliens in particular circumstances but did not involve conclusions that they meet the tripartite test. These individuals may still be required to be detained in the future, in the event further inquiries demonstrate more conclusively they do not meet the tripartite test and they do not hold visas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to your second question, the Department of Home Affairs continues to manage individual cases that raise claims of meeting the tripartite test and continues to consider the implications of the High Court's decision for Commonwealth programs in consultation with other Australian government departments, including the Attorney-General's Department, the National Indigenous Australians Agency, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. In relation to your third question, there are currently no plans to alter the visa scheme to introduce special conditions. As I say, if those responses don't fully answer your questions, I'll come back with some further detail. And, as I've mentioned to you, I'd encourage you to have some discussions with Minister Giles about those issues.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government's recent decision to expand the classification of a distribution priority area to include suburbs of state capital cities is more bad news for regional Australia. Regional communities from my home state of Western Australia, who were already struggling to get doctors, will now have to compete with large metropolitan areas.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole idea of the DPA was to identify areas experiencing lower numbers of GP services and provide unique channels and incentives for them to be able to attract GPs and be able to retain them in these areas. Three areas in Western Australia where the Labor government have now granted full or partial DPA status include Kwinana, Kalamunda and Brigadoon. For those not familiar with Perth, these suburbs are hardly even considered outer metropolitan suburbs. In fact, I live just north of one of these places, and it is hardly a regional area, and certainly not a remote area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the government doing? It's just going to draw in people to work in these areas. I'm not at all disputing the fact that there would be a need for GPs and GP services in these localities across Perth and, indeed, across Australia, where the other locations are. We know that Fyshwick is listed, which is just down the road from here. Tuggeranong is another one which is just down the road—not too far at all. There might be need for GPs in these areas, but you need to come for a drive around Western Australia to some of the regional communities that are in desperate need of adequate services provided by GPs. You don't even have to go that far.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you go out to somewhere up in the Kimberley, across to Halls Creek and Fitzroy Crossing and Kununurra. How do these places attract staff, GPs and GP services if you're providing in the capital cities the same incentives and initiatives that are designed to support those communities and regional areas? I've got no doubt that these locations may be struggling to attract and retain GPs, but it should not be at the expense of GPs leaving regional and remote areas of Western Australia, which are already battling to ensure that they're able to access sufficient health services. It's not too difficult to work out that, in general, the health status of people declines the more remote they are, the further they are from capital cities. Therefore, it's hard to imagine that the changes the government has made will strengthen the ability of Western Australians in regional and remote areas to access GP services, and how they will be improved. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we know is—and I'm wondering if we're going to start to see a pattern here—that when the Labor Party was last in government, they started to really tinker with health services. One of the things they tinkered with a lot was the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, where we saw the delisting of medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Yet while we were in government—the whole time that I was in this place sitting on the other side—we listed an equivalent of one new medicine for every day of the last term. I don't know about you, Senator Rennick, but it is one of the great things that, as a new senator in this place, I am proud that we were able to achieve—to see that happen, to see that track record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this mob on the other side don't have the ability to manage the books. They don't have the ability to manage the affairs of this government appropriately. Australians need a government that is sensible about their needs and about the services required, and who are prepared to stand up and do what is necessary and not just rob Peter to pay Paul to provide the services that are required—and that's exactly what we're seeing here. We need services in the bush, and all this is doing is taking it away from them. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:10</span>):  Sometimes it's difficult to understand whether the opposition understands what a 'dixer' is, because this question is an opportunity for those on this side to talk about the appalling history under the Morrison government and its treatment of Medicare and GPs, particularly in rural and regional areas, and what our government is doing to fix the mess you left.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me break this down for you. You so utterly broke the Medicare system and the reliance on GPs that it was so incredibly difficult for people to see a GP in rural and regional areas. But now we have a situation where we have had to step in and make sure people can see a GP. But it's very interesting to see that those opposite are opposed to the use of distribution priority areas. I am wondering whether senators on that side have consulted with members of their own party, because I know that, in Queensland, Cairns is a distribution priority area. The member for Leichhardt hasn't opposed that listing. Townsville has DPA status. The member for Herbert hasn't opposed that listing. Mackay has DPA status, and the Whitsundays. And we certainly haven't seen that happen from the member for Dawson. And Hervey Bay has DPA status, under the Labor government. We know that means that the member for Hinkler must be very supportive of our policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is clear that under the Liberal-Nationals government—the former Morrison government—at every opportunity they had, they ripped out funding from Medicare and made it harder to see a GP. We know they froze the Medicare rebate for six years. If you speak to a GP, whether in the city or the bush, they will tell you that the former government ripped the heart out of Medicare when they froze the rebate. They went as far as to cut access to telehealth appointments for regional Australians. They also made sure that people living in places like Emerald were waiting 12 weeks to see a GP.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a Senate inquiry and we put that motion to this place, and those opposite—who are going to get up today and talk about access to GPs—voted against that inquiry. You said there was no problem, that there was no issue, nothing to see here, no problem to be fixed. But when we held that inquiry, initiated by Labor, we heard horrible stories from people around the country about the treatment that you lot put them through so that they couldn't see a GP. That is why a Labor government is strengthening Medicare, and we were very clear at the election and were supported at the election to form a government with a core value of strengthening Medicare and protecting it. We will be delivering urgent-care clinics in regional areas and across the country. We have developed the Strengthening Medicare Taskforce, an important opportunity to bring so many people around the table to fix this workforce issue caused by your former government. And we have delivered DPA access to areas that are desperately in need of GPs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will not stand here and be lectured by a political party that sacked nurses in Queensland. Queenslanders will never forget that. We know that Queenslanders are so pleased to finally have a government that values Medicare. I won't stand here, as someone who lives in a regional area, and be lectured to by those opposite about who cares about access to GPs and Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the previous speaker raised the issue of medicines. Well, I have fantastic news for you. Today, we have announced that we will be making medicines cheaper for millions of Australians. This is a fantastic step forward—the first time in 75 years—</span>

                  </a>  Are you opposed? There is a choice here. You can support that policy or you can be opposed to it, but we on this side of the chamber know that our government is making medicines cheaper. We'll be introducing legislation. You'll have the opportunity to support that legislation to make sure that people have access to the medicines that they need. Labor built Medicare, and we will always protect it. You tried to rip the heart out of Medicare. You made it harder to see a GP. That is why our Labor government is fixing it. We will always stand here on our record, and it is complete rubbish from your side of politics to lecture us about access to GPs in rural and regional areas.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator RENNICK:</span>
                  </a>  I've actually got something important to say because I actually know the history of health care in this country. Let me tell you: the state governments have taken advantage of the good nature with which Medicare was set up and have cost-shifted from the states onto the federal government. I know that because when I grew up and had to see a doctor I would sit in a thing called 'Outpatients' in a public hospital. That has been renamed 'Emergency'. The reason they renamed it 'Emergency' is so that people don't go to Emergency. The state governments want it that way because then they don't have to pick up the cost. By sending it to a doctor in the primary healthcare system they get the federal government to pick up the cost. The problem with that is that it has overloaded the system on the doctors. What we need in this country is more doctors on fixed salaries, and we need the public health system in the states—to be honest, we need to go further than this. We need to get one level of government trying to run health care in this country, because we're getting this cost shifting all the time in this blame game between the federal and state governments, and these ambiguous responsibilities result in nothing but name-calling, rather than problem-solving.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will touch on something that Senator Green was talking about, this so-called discount for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. That may sound very well at first intentions, but the point is that you need to ask the question. I notice there was a cholesterol drug called Lipitor, which was a prescription drug patented by Pfizer. This goes back a decade or so. The Australian government was paying about 50 bucks for this particular drug, and Pfizer was collecting about $40 of the $50. The fact was that there was a similar generic drug that came off patent that you could have bought for $2. So it's all very well saying that you're spending billions of dollars on the PBS, but the question needs to be asked about whether or not there are suitable drugs out there that you can use and that aren't going to line the pockets of rich pharmaceutical companies. I would like to see greater detail of the PBS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Getting back onto doctors and having priority schemes for doctors, the fact of the matter is that we've got an undersupply of doctors in this country. We need to also point the finger at the professional bodies of the medical industry, who, quite frankly, aren't training enough doctors here in this country. I touched on this in my maiden speech. It is an absolute insult that Australia, a First World country, is importing doctors from underdeveloped countries because our AMA and our doctors are running a cartel in this country and are restricting the supply of specialist services in order to make sure that they can maximise their fees. We've got to have a serious look at this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want to get bipartisan on this, because I am sick to death of the health issues that we've got in this country. If we're meant to solve this problem, we really need to get one level of government taking responsibility for health. I'm happy to work with Labor on this, and I mean that, because regional health is very, very important to me. In the last 30 years, I've seen under the Queensland state Labor government the closure of over 30 maternity wards in regional Queensland. I know that it happens in other states as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's because of a combination of factors, but one of those factors is that we just will not get doctors to go to the regions. They don't want to take on the insurance because they work in the private sector. We've got a problem with training nurses. Many nurses now do either general practice or midwifery but they don't do both. If you want nurses out in the regions you need them to get their general ticket—Mum would always call it a 'general ticket'—and be a midwife as well. Out there, there aren't enough babies being born every day to have a full-time midwife; they need to also be general nurses as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the day, what we really need are better front-end services. I would actually like to get rid of the states altogether, but it is absurd that we have nine health bureaucracies in this country while our front-end services are suffering. We've really got to get serious about having a big overview. If you want a jobs summit, you should have a health summit—and I will turn up to that one, I guarantee you that.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator O'NEILL:</span>
                  </a>  Let's get to the reality of what Medicare does and why we're talking about GPs today. The government of the last nine years, and their various iterations over the last few decades, have attacked Medicare at every turn. The main cause of a bankruptcy before Medicare was medical debt—Australians died or they sold their house. Finally, the Labor Party moved to make sure that was no longer the case, and Medicare was established. In establishing that, we changed the course of the health of this nation in a very positive way. It was attacked relentlessly by every iteration of the federal Liberal-National government that came after. That's what we've seen over the last nine years, so let's get a little bit of fact on the record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality that we confronted when the Rudd-Gillard government was established was that there was a declining number of GPs being trained. We completely changed that and ramped up training of our own. Mr Abbott's solution as health minister was to stop training Australians and bring in overseas-trained doctors. It was a short-term decision and a bad long-term decision. The reality is that those wonderful GPs that we trained happened to come out into a medical profession that was being ripped asunder by the Abbott government. When they froze Medicare, they basically kicked out from underneath the business model of our GPs—their sustainability as a practice. What happened with those smart cookies who were training to be GPs? They had a look at these businesses in collapse, destroyed by the Australian government, and they said, 'Hold on, I don't really want to be a GP anymore.' We don't have a training problem in terms of the numbers. We have a problem of a broken business model that has destroyed general practices across this country. Right across this country, it's the Liberal and National parties, who always pump themselves up as being great understanders of businesses, who broke the back of the GP business model for Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality that we confront right now is because of that failure. Because they broke access to GPs, they decided to tinker with this thing that they called the DPA or Distribution Priority Area classification. On the record, in the other chamber today, the Minister for Health and Aged Care very clearly indicated that the changes we were being asked about here today—changes to the DPA that Labor has instituted—were to reverse a cut made by the former government in 2019. It was a reverse to what that government had done in terms of denying Australians in this country access to a GP. They did that as a response to the failure of their own policies of ruining Australians' access to GPs. And then they thought they could just shrink the places in which it was distributed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Central Coast, there was evidence given to our committee—it was a Labor instituted GP shortage inquiry. It was our committee that determined to tell the reality of what's going on in Australia. Whether we were taking evidence in Victoria, Queensland, New South Wales or out in Whyalla, it was the same story everywhere: a completely ruined system and communities in desperate need of doctors. And it's the responsibility of the former government that we do not have that workforce today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now Labor have come in. We've been here, what, 108 days. We can't undo everything that they did wrong, but this really egregious move of cutting the DPA in 2019 was a con job by the former government. It didn't fix the problem. It bought them time, but what it didn't do was give Australians access to the health care that they paid for and the health care that they deserve. Labor is on the job of fixing the mess in the health sector that we have been left by the former government, and Australians can trust that the Labor Party who built Medicare will restore the integrity that the system deserves.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:26</span>):  Perhaps I can strike a somewhat more conciliatory note as we discuss what I consider to be a very important issue, and that is the access of Australians to general practitioners across this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those in the gallery—through you, Mr Deputy President—I might just explain what we're talking about here. It is what's referred to as distribution priority areas. For those areas which are classified as distribution priority areas, there are various incentives in place to attract medical professionals into those areas to be general practitioners. Benefits to attract medical professionals into those areas include, for international medical graduates and foreign graduates of accredited medical schools, having access to Medicare in those distribution priority areas only. If overseas medical practitioners come to this country, they can access Medicare as long as they're practising in those areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole intention of this policy is to try to provide an incentive for that pool of professionals to provide general practice services to Australians living in those rural and regional areas. That's the issue we're talking about. In my view, the system is broken and we shouldn't be focusing so much on history; we should be focusing on the way forward. How do we fix the system? We know the system is broken. There is such a lack of general practitioners that we now have the absurd situation of the incentives which are meant to be given to a medical practitioner to go to a place like Emerald, in my home state of Queensland, which is three hours from Rockhampton, being the same as the incentives which are provided to medical practitioners to practice at Fyshwick, 13 or 15 minutes down the road from Parliament House. It doesn't make sense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a>  People get sick in Fyshwick too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator SCARR:</span>
                  </a>  Of course they get sick, Senator O'Neill. Of course they do. As I said, I'm trying to strike a more conciliatory tone and look forward. The issue is that, if you're providing the same incentives to someone to work 15 minutes down the road from Parliament House as you're providing to someone in Mildura, over five hours from Melbourne, or Emerald, three hours from Rockhampton, the incentive obviously isn't going to work. The problem is so widespread around this country that there's a fundamental issue with the incentive system, and that's what we're talking about here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also a fundamental system issue, in my view, with what's referred to as the Modified Monash Model, which is the way in which different areas are categorised, and I've spoken to different communities across Queensland with respect to the application of that system. To give you one example, the town of Rosewood in my home state is put in the same classification as Ipswich. Again, me being a senator, this is one of my patron seats, and the demographics, the geographical challenges and the ability to attract medical staff are completely different in those two areas, but they are considered to be in the same category. This system, this modified Monash system, does not reflect what happens on the ground, the realities of local communities, and it is a system which we really should look at—it really is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally I'd like to, with indulgence, thank someone who brought this to my attention, and that is Mr Lyall McEwin. Lyall has served for many years as chair of an aged-care facility in a little town called Rosewood. He talked to me about his frustration as the chair of a community organisation providing aged-care services. He talked about the issue in terms of attracting health professionals to that aged-care facility when he's in the same category as Ipswich, which is more of a major metropolitan centre. There are major, major issues with this system—major, major issues in relation to this system and in relation to every Australian's legitimate expectation to be able to access health services, GP services in particular, whether or not they live in Mildura, whether or not they live in Fyshwick, down the road from Parliament House, or whether or not they live in Emerald, in country Queensland. And that is something which all of us should be united in attempting to fix.</span>

The minister was talking very big, the rhetoric was very big, but where is the action to address the low pay and the really difficult conditions that early childhood educators are subjected to? There is none. Today, on Early Childhood Educators' Day, thousands of early childhood educators have walked out of centres. Right now, they are gathering on the parliament's front lawns, to give a message to the government and to all parliamentarians to say that enough is enough. And the Greens are right with early childhood educators as they shut down the sector today. We give them our full solidarity, but we give them more than that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They can be assured that we will be fighting for better pay for them, for better conditions and for free and universal early childhood learning and care. Parliament needs to hear these calls for an immediate pay rise. Early childhood educators, who are now predominantly women, have been taken for granted for far too long, and they've also said, 'Enough!'. They are burning out and they are leaving the sector in droves. Literally every week I meet some of these educators who are telling me that they are working more and more from 6 am to very late at night. These are not conditions that educators or any workers should be subjected to, and educators do deserve professional pay that reflects the skill and the responsibility of the work that they do every single day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that early childhood education and care is an essential service, and it should be treated as such. It is critical for children in the early years of their development, and it should be well funded, it should be universal, and it should be fee-free. We know it benefits children, it benefits women, it benefits families, it benefits society and it benefits community, and yet the can has been kicked down the road. The Greens are calling on the government to bring legislation to lift wages and to improve conditions of educators and deal with the critical workforce shortage in early learning and care. These steps, hand in-hand with the Greens plan for free early learning and care for all, are absolutely vital to building a better future. So when will this government come to its senses and dump the $244 billion in stage 3 tax cuts, commit to essential public services like free and universal early learning and care, like giving early childhood educators and workers an immediate pay rise that they so deserve? We need to make sure that educators have the best pay and conditions, and we need action on this right now.</span>

But I do want to also add that the previous government, who actually invented this new Aboriginality for sovereign people, created some heartache and pain for many families. We had an Aboriginal man who was deported, who died after waiting six years as an Aboriginal man in another country for this government to allow him back into the country. He died waiting, and he came back in a body bag as a result. That family are still picking up the pieces. The number of children that this gentleman had are still reeling in the grief of not only not seeing their dad for six years but then having their dad coming home in a body bag.</span>

We had a situation where we had the government or the parliament making decisions on who's Aboriginal and who's not in this country, which is going into very, very dangerous territory. It's not up to any government to decide who is Aboriginal and who is not in this country.</span>

                  </a>  While the opposition is not against additional sitting hours, we don't accept that this proposal is appropriate. Firstly, we note these extra hours are being brought on just one day after the bill was introduced into the Senate and there has been no attempt to even use the normal hours of the Senate. Secondly, the bill changes nothing, as the targets it legislates have already been adopted by the government and committed to under the international agreement, so there is no urgency in this bill that actually changes nothing. Thirdly, the government has been making a big deal about a more family friendly parliament and sitting hours yet here we are in a greatly hypocritical move with the government proposing an open-ended debate that could see people sitting here well beyond midnight for a bill that changes nothing. We oppose the motion.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Don't take it from me. Take it from the Royal Commission itself.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">And if it wants to use evidence that's subject to privilege in its findings, the only way to do that is to redraw that evidence from witnesses. It has to redo the work, rerun the inquiry. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Counsel Assisting the Royal Commission found that parliamentary privilege prevents them from asking Defence representatives questions about the report because they can't make any kind of finding or conclusion from evidence that's subject to privilege. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The stage 3 tax cuts will cost $244 billion over the next ten years, and give billionaires, CEOs and politicians a $9,000 tax cut, while people on the minimum wage get nothing. Repealing these unfair and unjust tax cuts could fund immediate cost of living relief and make people's lives better by putting dental and mental healthcare into Medicare, building affordable housing, and making childcare free.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, the Prime Minister announced that the Labor government will not be repealing the obscene stage 3 tax cuts. Over the next 10 years, these will strip $244 billion out of the budget. You will all be aware by now how these cuts are benefiting the most wealthy people in this country—usually the ones who are responsible for the stolen wealth, but that's another story. This means that men will get $1 more than women receive. However, there has been little consideration of how these tax cuts will impact on First Nations people. As always, my people will benefit the least.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the country, everyday people are struggling to make ends meet in the most simple ways. People are struggling to pay rent, pay for food and pay for health care. Too often, those impacted the most by cost-of-living pressures are First Nations people. In the Lucky Country, the average personal income for First Nations people is around $35,000, compared with just under $50,000 for the rest of the population. That's 29 per cent lower. That will have lifelong impacts on my people's lives. With the proposed tax cuts, First Nations people will be paying, on average, $95 less tax in 2024-25, compared with $430 less tax paid by non First Nations people. This means that First Nations people will receive about $1 for every $4 others get from stage 3 tax cuts. First Nations people will see the least benefit and be the hardest hit by this tax reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These tax cuts will only worsen income inequality between First Nations people and the rest of the population. If the government allows these tax cuts to go ahead, it is choosing to give handouts to the stolen-wealth billionaires instead of funding crucial services that our people are calling out for. The $244 billion could be redirected towards funding community controlled health, housing and legal services. That could pull thousands of people in this country, particularly First Nations people, out of poverty. If this Labor government is truly committed to closing the gap, they will scrap these tax cuts and put the money back into providing proper housing, proper health care and good education for First Nations people in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that stolen wealth is also an issue in this country, and many, many people—many white people, many of the colonisers—actually benefited from stealing these lands. In fact, they still benefit today because of generations and generations of wealth creation for their families. I'm sure you know that story. But it's time to pay the rent and it's time to acknowledge that you're on stolen land.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WALSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  I rise to speak on the urgency motion before the Senate today regarding the stage 3 tax cuts. During the election campaign we made a commitment that we would provide certainty and clarity around tax to Australian working families, and our position on the legislated stage 3 income tax cuts has not changed since the election, because, after an incredibly difficult few years for our country and the world, certainty is what Australians deserve. The legislated stage 3 tax cuts are not due to commence for another two years, so they won't do anything to address the near-term economic challenges that we face, including with the growing inflation challenge that we have right now. Instead, our government's priority, when it comes to tax reform, is ensuring that multinationals pay their fair share of tax here in Australia. Our priority is cracking down on the waste and the rorts that have contributed to the $1 trillion of debt left to us by those opposite with absolutely nothing to show for it. We, the Albanese government, need to repair the budget mess left by those on the other side so that we can get on with delivering the meaningful investments that maximise economic impact and meet community needs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are paying the price right now for a decade of missed opportunities and absolutely messed-up priorities under the coalition government. The $1 trillion debt, high and rising inflation, rising interest rates and a cost-of-living crisis—these are the consequences of a decade of complete economic mismanagement by those opposite. Australians understand that we didn't create these challenges, but they elected us to take responsibility for fixing them—for addressing them. And we are. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our economic plan is a direct and deliberate response to the challenges facing the economy, including the rising cost of living that is hurting so many Australians today. We are getting on with the job, and we are delivering on our commitments. We are delivering on a better future for all Australians. We committed to rebuilding our economy with stronger wages and more secure work, and we are doing that. One of the very first acts of our government was to successfully argue for a minimum wage increase for our lowest-paid workers. That was an outcome which helped around 2.8 million Australians. And we followed that with a submission to the Fair Work Commission that unequivocally supports a wage increase for aged-care workers, for the tens of thousands of aged-care workers who do essential work every day but are completely undervalued with absolutely no action from those on the opposition benches. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We brought employers, unions and the community sector together at the Jobs and Skills Summit to discuss how we can get wages moving, how we can lift living standards and how we can improve productivity, which was nothing short of sluggish under the previous government. In so doing, we've ended up with a positive plan, bringing unions and employers together with the government. In so doing, we've ended the decade of division and delay from those opposite. We are delivering concrete outcomes from our Jobs and Skills Summit. We're delivering consensus on the need to improve the bargaining system and get wages moving again, as well as allowing age pensioners to work and earn more before it affects their pensions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We committed to investing in Australian skills, in Australian jobs, in Australian manufacturing, and, as the new government, we are doing it. We've secured a $1 billion national skills agreement with the states and the territories. We're delivering 180,000 fee-free TAFE places in 2023, with 15,000 set aside for aged care to meet the workforce challenges that we've been left with by a decade of inaction from the previous government. We're working hard to deliver on our commitment to invest in advanced manufacturing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We committed to backing clean energy and ending the climate wars, and we are doing it. We have reset Australia's commitment to climate on the world stage, sending a huge signal, an important signal, to the rest of the world that Australia is at the table and that Australia will do our part in the race towards net zero. We're working, just this week, right here, right now, to legislate our target of a 43 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030. Part of that is ensuring that our government is accountable to these targets and providing the certainty—which the Australian people want—that we will actually deliver against those targets. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of our response to the climate crisis, we're making electric vehicles cheaper with our Treasury Laws Amendment (Electric Car Discount) Bill 2022, which we hope the opposition will support, and our National Electric Vehicle Strategy. We are securing Australia's future by delivering our Powering Australia plan. We are making the largest ever upgrade to our energy grid and driving down power prices for households and small businesses after a decade of complete inaction by those on the other side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also committed to easing cost-of-living pressures for Australian families. We are doing that too. We are getting on with the commitments that we made, and we are delivering them. Our budget in October will include our plans for cheaper child care, which will make a huge difference to the household budgets of millions of Australians. Next year, 96 per cent of Australian families will benefit from cheaper early learning. They will benefit from quality, affordable early childhood education under the plans that our government took to the election, which we are ready to implement right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also removing the penalty for parents taking on extra hours or extra days of work. That was a huge priority that came out of the Jobs and Skills Summit. We know that one of the biggest things we can do as a nation to improve workforce participation is encourage more carers of small children into the workforce—that's usually women—so providing quality, affordable and accessible early education is critical to our nation's economic future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we've introduced legislation to reduce the cost of essential medicines. This is the first time any government has reduced the PBS co-payment. That is going to mean that essential medicines people are accessing on the PBS will cost around $30 less per month, a saving of around $300 a year for the average person who is relying on those PBS medicines. We're helping to ensure that fewer people have to miss filling a script because they can't afford it. The stories of people having to do that are extraordinary. We don't want people to have to choose between taking painkilling medication or taking another medication they need to address their underlying condition. That should not be happening in Australia, and we are getting on with fixing that problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no denying that the last few years have been difficult. We know that Australians are doing it incredibly tough. We don't need economic forecasts to tell us that, because we are listening to Australians every day. What Australians want is certainty from their government on the way forward. They want a government that does what it said it would do. That is the Albanese government. They want a government that will stick to its word and deliver on its commitments. It's exactly what we're doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The legacy of those opposite is a decade of mistakes and missed opportunities, a decade of waste and rorts, a decade of division and delay. They had no plans past the last election. They had no vision for anyone's future but their own. In May, Australians sent a strong and clear message. They wanted change. They wanted a government they could trust, a government who would bring the country together, not divide it, and a government with a plan to address the challenges that families and businesses are facing right now. That's exactly what we are delivering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government were elected with a clear and ambitious plan to build a stronger, more equal Australia. That's what we're doing. We're keeping our promises and working hard to deliver the better future Australians deserve.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  What we need as a country right now is to grow our economy—to increase the size of the pie, so to speak—because that is the best way to manage the enormous public debt that we now have, thanks first to the excessive spending of the Rudd-Gillard years and then because of our necessary response to a global pandemic over the last couple of years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have a public debt approaching, and soon to be above, $1 trillion. The best way to help manage that, to deal with that, is to grow our economy. By doing so, we'll have more tax revenue and more wealth to manage that debt. We now have a debt to national income, or GDP, ratio at a level we haven't seen since the years after World War II. The way we came back from that crushing level of debt in the years after World War II, after defeating the evil of fascism, was to grow our economy. The fifties and sixties was a period of massive economic change and growth in this country that we had not ever seen. It came on the back of the world opening up after the war and the Menzies government of the time keeping an open and vibrant economy. We need to learn those lessons here, after a global pandemic which has not been as devastating as that war but which has left similar consequences of large public debt. We have to keep an open economy. We have to get our tax rates down and be competitive so that people will invest, work and thrive in this country and make more wealth for all of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality right now is that our tax systems are not competitive with those of the rest of the world, especially our personal income tax system. We have a high corporate tax rate, but what's often forgotten or not commented upon is that we have a franking credits system that does not double-tax corporate profits, so the actual impact of the corporate tax rate of 30 per cent is not as high as it might seem on a direct comparison with overseas countries, because, when you get dividends, you can also usually get franked credits. If the company has paid taxes on those, you won't pay the top marginal rate; you'll pay the difference between the marginal rate and the corporate rate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's no such equalising factor for those earning income from labour. The workers of this country get slugged at a rate that is much higher than that of the rest of the world. Our top rate of 45 per cent—it's really 47 per cent when you add the Medicare levy—cutting in at $180,000 a year is one of the highest rates in the developed world, and it cuts in at a level of income that is much lower than where the top rate cuts in in many other countries in the rest of the world. I will give a few examples. At 45 per cent, the top rate in the United Kingdom is about the same as ours, but it doesn't cut in until someone earns 150,000 pounds. That's over A$260,000. In the United States, the top rate is just 37 per cent, a full 10 percentage points lower than Australia's. Even in New Zealand, their top rate is just 39 per cent. So we're way out of whack with many comparable countries that we would be competing with for talent, especially in a world where borders have opened up and people can move.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have high tax rates below that level for middle-income people. What the stage 3 tax cuts are all about is making sure that middle-income people can have the aspiration to become higher-income people, become wealthier and provide a better future for their children, because these tax cuts, the so-called stage 3 tax cuts that come in in 2024-25, will actually provide a tax saving for any Australian who earns over $45,000 a year. That is a lot of people. That's a lot of Australians. In fact, 95 per cent of Australian taxpayers will benefit from these tax cuts in a few years time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear a lot of rhetoric about these tax cuts being for the rich and benefiting those who are well-to-do. Well, we've got to look at the whole series of tax cuts here. These tax cuts will get rid of one whole tax bracket and make our system much simpler and easier for people. The 37c tax bracket will go. The tax rate will be at least 30c in the dollar for anyone earning over $45,000. The top rate will then only kick in at $200,000, which will remain the same. That is a big tax cut for middle Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The stage 3 tax cuts are a tax cut for middle Australia. Those Australians smack dab in the middle class earn income somewhere between that $45,000 a year and $200,000 a year. That is middle Australia. Some of those people at the higher end are very lucky and do very well, but all of them probably have worked hard in their lives to get to that level, and they deserve reward for effort. We want to encourage future Australians to continue that effort, so these tax cuts come at the right time and in the right place for our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we continue to have higher tax rates than the rest of the world, that will punish effort. It will mean that people will think twice about starting a business. Why would you go and work a bit harder to try to get ahead so you can maybe put your kids through school or do something when the tax office is going to take so much of what you earn?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point to make here is that already the average tax rate in this country sits at just over 30c or so in the dollar. That's not the marginal rates but the average rates that people pay. When you think about it, that means that, when most people start work on a Monday, all of Monday is for the tax office. Every bit of work they do on the Monday is for this place. That's for money to come down here to Canberra. About half of Tuesday, too, for the average taxpayer is also on the Canberra clock, just working for the government down here. It's not until after smoko on Tuesday afternoon that you actually get to work for yourself. What we're saying is that maybe we should move that point from lunchtime to morning tea, from big lunch to little lunch, so you can earn a little bit more for yourself and take it home for your family to help them and give them a better future.</span>

                  </a>  I don't think you're going to do any better, Senator Chisholm. I think it's a disease in this place. A lot of the money that comes here gets wasted. A lot of your money, that work you do on the Monday and on the Tuesday morning, doesn't always generate the public services that some people like to claim down here. Maybe, if we do have an issue with affording the stage 3 tax cuts, of having to deal at least temporarily with a bit of lower tax revenue, we could look at what is spent here in Canberra and in the bureaucracy to make sure that your money, your hard work, is actually providing value for the Australian people. Every Australian family does that. If, after these tax cuts—I'm hoping to god they get through—middle Australia gets a little more money to take home, I know they'll spend it very carefully. They'll think about where that money should go and how it should help their children and their families. I'm not so sure we always do that here. That's why we can afford these tax cuts. These tax cuts will make for a stronger Australia if they go through.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  People want a fair tax system. They recognise that paying tax in Australia allows us to have the quality of life that we have. Paying tax allows us to have the services that we have. Don't be conned by Senator Canavan that taxes simply come to Canberra. Taxes are paying for Medicare. Taxes are providing funds for aged care so that our elderly can actually live in dignity. Taxes are providing a world-class medical system here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard so much from the Labor government over the last 108 days about the failures of the Liberal-National government; everything is their fault. They've inherited a total mess worse than they possibly thought. They didn't create any of these challenges but they're going to fix them, which is great. You can't say that and, at the same time, stand by bad policy when it comes to stage 3 tax cuts. We're in a cost-of-living crisis. Yes, some people on lower wages will get some tax back. If you're a registered nurse on $72,000 a year, you'll have an extra 681 bucks in your pocket. But if you're a politician here, like Senator Canavan, on $211,000, you'll get $9,000 back. I don't see the fairness in that. I think at this time Australians would recognise that this is not the way that we want to go. This is not how we should be spending our money given the challenges that we face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear from the Labor government that they can't afford to increase shared paid parental leave. That has consensus coming out of their Jobs and Skills Summit. There simply isn't the money. Well, here's $243 billion that we're going to give back, mostly to wealthy Australians, mostly to men, rather than actually spending it on things that Australians want, actually spending it on addressing the crisis that we face, the cost-of-living crisis. We've got people here in Canberra who we're now calling the working homeless. It is shameful for a country like Australia to still be considering these tax cuts when so many people are doing it tough. The Labor government should be ashamed of this decision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you're the new government, it is unconscionable to stand by bad policy that may have been justifiable years ago when it was legislated. Sure, there may have been an argument for it, but a lot has happened since then. We have had bushfires, a two-year global pandemic, geopolitical conflict—Russia invading Ukraine—energy prices going through the roof, rising inflation, cost-of-living pressures putting so many everyday Australians under strain, and the Labor government wants to give $243 billion to the wealthiest Australians, mostly men. It is, frankly, ridiculous, and the pressure is only going to mount. I urge you to use your political capital. We hear a lot about how popular the new Labor government is. Use that. Be decisive. This is not going away. This will come into effect just before the next election. I will be interested to see how that plays out, given how tough so many Australians are doing it.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  It is nice to see you, Mr Acting Deputy President O'Sullivan. It is always good to know when the clock starts ticking because that is the opportunity to make some remarks about this very important matter. When it comes to the philosophy here, it is very clear that there are different views about the role of the state and the role of money within our society and economy. Personally, my view has always been that the state has no money of its own. It must go and levy that from its citizens. That is what we do to provide services and the like, and we have done it over the last few years on a scale that has not been seen for some decades, as a result of this economic shock and health crisis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Philosophically, we are committed to the idea that people's money is their own and we should only seek to levy their incomes, salaries and wages to pay for services that are required and nothing more. The stage 3 tax cuts, as they are called—in hindsight I think it was a mistake to have broken them down into three stages; they should have been done in one go—are effectively saying, 'Look, we are going to simplify the five brackets down to four and ensure that middle-income earners in particular are able to work an extra shift or do some extra work and not be penalised.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By being placed into a higher income bracket, people might be paying 32.5c in the dollar rather than 30c in the dollar if these tax cuts were repealed. That's what we're talking about here. We're talking about a proposition to repeal tax cuts, which would result in a tax increase. It would result in a tax increase to, yes, higher income earners and it would also result in a significant tax increase to middle-income earners. People who are earning $60,000 to $70,000 would pay additional taxation because they would be pushed into a higher tax bracket. We would be going back to five tax brackets, which would not be in their interest. We want to have an economy where people want to work additional shifts and take on more hours if they want to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know it's not fashionable to look at the issues facing the higher end of the tax spectrum, but the reality is that the people who were here last week at the Jobs and Skills Summit were talking about the issues facing Australian business. Legitimately they have raised the issue of access to skills. We are at a point in our history where we are competing for capital and we are competing for skilled labour. If you look at our closest competitors, their top tax rate cuts are in, in the case of Singapore, at $335,000 and in the case of Japan at $417,000—so almost double our threshold, which is quite low compared with those of our competitors. If we are serious about this nation's competitive position and serious about attracting skilled people to take on roles in this country, when Australian businesses are saying they can't get access to these skilled people, then why would we want to put lead in our own saddlebags and have an even more uncompetitive situation in relation to taxation?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sure, I know that that part of the argument may not be particularly fashionable, but it is the truth—that $200,000 is a relatively low threshold relative to the thresholds of our competitors. We can imagine ourselves as some locked-away, protected, subsidised economy, as we were in the 1970s and 1980s—and you can look at the history books and see how that went—or we can be realistic and honest about the challenges the nation faces in relation to skilled workers. That is the truth. The middle-income earners would face a tax increase by being dragged into a higher bracket and it would be harder to attract higher-income earners, which are needed to fill the skills gaps that we heard about last week at the talkfest. We heard the Treasurer today talk about his 36 concrete recommendations. Well, if you go and listen to the business people, they will say that access to skills is one of the most important things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true that the government cannot be held responsible for every single problem in the economy. Given that they have been in office for a relatively short period of time, it would be ridiculous to claim that all the ills should be put at their feet. But over the medium to long term you have to try to get the fundamental position right, and that is that we need to be a dynamic economy whereby we have a competitive tax system and a flexible labour market which allows our businesses to be competitive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The RBA has just decided that it will raise interest rates. That will make it difficult for people who have large mortgages, and, representing New South Wales, I am very aware that there are people with large Sydney mortgages who will be finding this recent uptick in interest rates very difficult. I'm pleased the government is reviewing the RBA. I would say, whilst not making any personal criticism of him, that the RBA governor has made statements in the past that didn't need to be made, that set market expectations in a way that I think has made things more difficult than they should have been. Sometimes it's better to say fewer things. Sometimes fewer words are better. And I do think there are a lot of people now who will struggle to make their mortgage repayments. Commonwealth Bank data shows that 30 to 35 per cent of people in the capital cities have a very threadbare position when it comes to paying back their mortgages. So, ultimately, we don't want to make things any harder than they will be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing that would make it harder for people would be to increase taxation, because by increasing taxation we'll be saying to the rest of the world, 'We're not interested in new investment; we're not interested in having a dynamic and competitive economy,' and therefore there will be fewer jobs; there will be fewer high-paying jobs. And of course one of the things that's within the government's preserve is tax policy, and there is no case to remove the tax cuts that are designed to improve the investment profile of the country. Any removal of those tax cuts will be a tax increase.</span>

People understand that a budget and governing are about choices, and they hear it loud and clear when the Prime Minister talks about how choices are being made. What this government is doing is choosing to keep the stage 3 tax cuts. They are actively choosing to give $244 billion over 10 years to people that are CEOs, billionaires and politicians. All of those folk are going to get about a $9,000 tax cut every year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're in a cost-of-living crisis. I don't think anyone disagrees with that. Why of all things would you be giving tax cuts to the rich when people are struggling to meet their daily cost-of-living challenges? Budgets are about choices. The Australian people did vote for a new government. Why are you keeping the policies of the last one? They weren't right then and they're even less right now. It is the most ill-timed policy decision that you could possibly make, and I think it is a betrayal of everyone who voted Labor that you are going to keep the stage 3 tax cuts. They are now your stage 3 tax cuts, I'm afraid. These are now Labor's stage 3 tax cuts for the wealthy. At the same time, the new government is saying the country is too poor to make child care free, the country is too poor to fix homelessness and the country is too poor to make Medicare include dental and mental health. I'm sorry, but that is just heartbreaking nonsense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you axe those stage 3 tax cuts, PBO costings show that you could in fact end homelessness, make child care free and put dental and mental health care into Medicare. Those are the sorts of things that will provide real cost-of-living relief to people and provide services which they deserve to be able to rely on and access free of charge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On child care, we've got a thousand childcare centres striking today because they are begging for better pay and conditions. So we could also make child care free for parents. But we should be paying those workers more. You could do that with the $244 billion over 10 years—pay women more. Give a legislated increase above CPI to feminised industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard a lot of talk at the jobs summit last week about women's workforce participation. There's a great idea—pay woman more. Then they won't have to strike out the front of Parliament House, desperately pleading for pay and conditions that reflect the calibre of their work and the importance of their work in raising the next generation. Free child care would cost $9 billion a year. That's a lot of money, but that would ensure women can get back into the workforce; importantly, it would ensure that kids get the best early childhood education that they deserve, that would set them up for a bright future; and, of course, it would reduce not only the gender pay gap but the unfair distribution of unpaid domestic labour in the home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has got a real choice to make. Are they going to be 'Morrison lite', or are they actually going to dump a bad policy and help people? It shouldn't be that much of a conundrum to decide whether to give $244 billion to the rich or to make child care free, fix homelessness and put dental and mental health care into Medicare.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  If the Senate is talking about tax and the cost of living, we cannot ignore the most regressive tax on the poor and the vulnerable. Parliament is considering it now—$244 billion over 10 years barely registers compared to the trillions of dollars in economic mayhem that climate change and related energy policies are already inflicting, will continue inflicting and are making worse. Make no mistake; climate change and related energy policies are a brutal, highly regressive tax on the poor and the vulnerable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Trying to tax carbon dioxide means trying to tax every single thing we do as humans, including breathing. That's why the United Nations and the World Economic Forum are pushing these burdens. They want to control every single thing we do. For these policies, the poor will always proportionally pay the highest price—by far, the highest price. Rich, inner-city elites can afford to buy a brand-new electric vehicle. The poor cannot. The rich can afford the outlay to install solar, which they get back with subsidies that the poor pay for through higher electricity charges. The poor cannot. The rich will be able to afford it when power bills go up, and, despite promises about the wind and solar pipedream, power bills are skyrocketing and will skyrocket. The poor cannot afford it, and, while life gets harder and more expensive for the poor, billions of dollars are being poured into the doomed wind and solar pipedreams. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Companies receiving government subsidies to build wind and solar complexes are giant multinational companies, quite often associated with the Chinese Communist Party and run for the benefit of the billionaire CEOs, billionaire owners. Climate change policies are like a reverse Robin Hood, taking taxes from the poor and giving to the rich, thanks to the Greens, the Liberal Party, the Labor Party and the Nationals. People on the minimum wage will suffer as life gets more expensive—much, much more expensive. As more intermittent and unreliable wind and solar is forced into the grid and reliable baseload power is prematurely forced out, power bills will go ever higher. As productive farming land is locked up for carbon dioxide credits that the Nationals, Liberals, Labor and the Greens want, groceries will get more expensive. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, let's talk briefly about the carbon dioxide credit rort. If a producer of carbon dioxide pays for enough trees to supposedly offset carbon dioxide, it will get the green tick of approval and continue producing carbon dioxide. It's a tax, a hypocritical and destructive tax, about everything in life, because the end user, the customer, the people, will pay. The credits don't stop anything. They just say companies can do it as long as we, the people, pay a tree fee. Of course, that includes a fee to the companies and the government and the United Nations for their apparent services in managing this system—a tax. There are many more examples, and no-one should be in any doubt: climate change policies and related energy policies try to change the entire country, the entire economy. These changes will restrict almost everything—everything—making life more expensive. The rich will be able to afford it. The poor will not. Climate policies are a highly regressive tax on the poor. </span>

Cutting taxes is good for your family, it's good for Australia. Indeed, it is our patriotic duty as Australians to fly our flag, cut our taxes and have a barbecue, because, I don't know about you, Mr Acting Deputy President O'Sullivan, I want Australians to have more money into their back pocket. I want Australians to decide how they spend their money, so I want to cut taxes. I came into this place to cut taxes because we believe in freedom. We believe in the right and the might of the individual to decide how they spend their money, and what we're seeing is the Greens coming into this place because they think they know better than Australians. </span>

                  </a>  I will withdraw, Mr Acting Deputy President, but let me put it to you: the Greens and people who sit with the colour green—the teal towards the dark green—they wouldn't know truth if it fell on them from a high place. If these stage 3 tax cuts are repealed, it means a teacher who earns a $70,000 a year would lose $620, a nurse earning $90,000 a year would lose $870 and a diesel fitter—diesel, it's a scary word for the Greens because they don't like diesel—earning $100,000 a year would lose more than $1,370 a year. The tax cuts are all about middle Australia. The Greens come here—these whinging, whining, pathetic people—with their extensive property portfolios. Did you know the member from Ryan has four homes? How many of those homes do you think are out for social housing? I say to the Greens who love taking the money but don't like sharing it that they are a bunch of hypocrites.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is the other fallacy being spread by the fairies at the bottom of the garden. They're saying that those who earn more don't pay their fair share. How wrong is that? When the stage 3 is fully implemented, an individual with a taxable income of $200,000, who earns 4.4 times more than an individual with a taxable income of $45,000, will pay 10 times more tax. This is why we come into politics, ladies and gentlemen. We come into politics because we believe in freedom. We come into politics because we want individuals, businesses and families to grow. The best way for Australians to grow is for them to have more money in their back pockets. This is why these tax cuts, when they are implemented, are so good for Australia.</span>

                  </a>  and it will be a power-sharing deal, as a Senator Scarr pointed out. They will do a deal and these tax cuts will be no more. They will do a deal. Listen to the language of people like the Minister for Finance, who is sitting over there. They are not strident in their defence of these tax cuts. They are using the wishy-washy language of the Labor Party. So do not be surprised by this breaking news that these tax cuts will not proceed, because of the weakness of that side. How wrong is that for those of us who believe in freedom and believe in cutting taxes because we want you to have more money in your back pocket?</span>

They say they're standing with workers, but on the really big decisions—the ones that are the $244 billion decisions, which are make or break on fairness—they say they can't do anything about it, that they agreed to it a few years ago and they're just stuck. Well, here is a message to the Labor government: you are now in government. You are not stuck with the coalition's rotten tax agenda. Have the courage to stand up and reverse these tax cuts.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cancelling these tax cuts means that we can get dental and mental care into Medicare. Think about the changes that would make to have dental in Medicare. It is outrageous that in this country one of the key indicators of your class and your wealth is the state of your teeth. The only reason that is, and the only reason that will be next year and the year after, is that Labor doesn't have the courage to reverse these outrageous billionaire focused tax cuts.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can make child care free, and we can pay early childhood educators and all teachers a fair wage, but we can't do that while we had out $244 billion in tax cuts to billionaires and politicians and those who already have enough. This parliament should be standing alongside those early childhood educators who are out there today, taking action for better pay and conditions so they can look after our kids and our grandkids. That's what they want to do. And I give a shout-out to the United Workers Union and every single childcare worker. Stand strong! The Greens are with you and we'll keep fighting for you until we reverse these tax cuts and give you the pay and conditions you deserve. Childcare educators are striking today, and they are calling for this parliament to put children before profit. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what Labor needs to do: put people before profit. It needs to put nurses, midwives and healthcare workers before profit, to put teachers and students before profit and to put First Nations people across this country before profit. That's who this parliament should be for—not the billionaires, who don't need another tax break. It should be for the millions of Australians who are desperate for help while their wages are stuck and expenses are skyrocketing. This parliament should be standing up for young people, for people on Centrelink, for people with disabilities, for First Nations people, for people without a home, for people renting and unable to even think about owning a home in this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But these people will be worse off under Labor's tax cut. This parliament should be for every single one of you who needs our help. To all of you I say this: the Greens believe this parliament should be for you and will keep fighting to make good on that promise. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BARBARA POCOCK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  Australia has a proud history of a progressive tax system. The stage 3 tax cuts are a watershed in relation to that history. They represent a turning away, and we know that we will never get back what we are going to give away with this reform, if it proceeds. We need to hang onto a proud Australian tradition, which is a tax system that looks after the bottom and fairly distributes the resources to the services that every Australian needs. These tax increases will give, as we all know—as I hope every Australian knows—$9,000 to billionaires and $9,000 to everyone in this place, but nothing for those on the minimum wage, nothing for the working poor, who the other Senator Pocock spoke about, and nothing for the workers at the front of this parliament today who every day turn up for a job that pays them just over $20 an hour. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think a lot about the care economy. I think about the economy that delivers care for our children, care for people with disability and care for our older citizens. All of us in this place, over our lifetime, depend on that care, and we all know that in depending on that care we need to look after it fairly. We need to make sure that those workers who are helping to look after our kids, grandchildren, parents or other friends with disability are properly rewarded and supported. We have a care economy in this country which is starved. It is thinned out. It is underpaid. It is overworked. It is disrespected. The stage 3 tax cuts are a doorway to making a historic intervention to fix that economy, which will be good for the future of our country and the citizens of this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an economist, I know that when things change, when economic circumstances change, we have to change strategy. Only a fool doesn't do that. This policy was wrong at the time it was shaped. Labor knew it, and Labor opposed it. It is totally wrong now in such different economic circumstances. We are in an inequality crisis. The top of Australia has run away from the bottom. We can measure it in housing. We can measure it in the quality of care. We can measure it in our health care. We can measure it, as my colleague says, in the quality of our teeth. And we can certainly measure it in a cost-of-living crisis which is leaving so many Australians under such pressure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I met with Sam, a worker at Port Lincoln in South Australia, who came to the parliament to talk about his life as a carer for a household of people with disability. Sam works for $23 an hour. He's been doing the same job for 4½ years as a casual. He feels disrespected, he feels underpaid, he feels exhausted and he loves the people he cares for. He says, 'I love the guys I care for.' He is working for love, and he is not paid enough money. It is vitally important that we stop the stage 3 tax cuts and turn to the parts of our economy that are so desperate for our attention, for our resources and for our care. We must not pass the stage 3 tax cuts. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  Thank you, President and fellow senators of this 47th Parliament. In making my way as an elected member to this place I contested two Liberal Senate preselections and two federal election campaigns, one in 2016 and again in 2022. I have spoken with many hundreds of party members and listened to thousands of voters at shows, street corners and shopping centres across South Australia on the issues that matter to them most. At the 2022 election, with a marked level of concern, people spoke of the increasing cost of living; individual and national security and safety; health and mental health; housing for owning and renting; and the environment. It was not all about climate change. In a nutshell my observation is there's a desire for relative certainty and looking forward to a better future, not looking back. What I learned from these interactions was the importance of listening not to the loudest, not to the most resourced and not to the most organised but to all the voices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With experience in executive management and leadership across some of our largest and most economically significant industries, much of my work has been in the true engine room that fuels our economy—the private sector. I've owned and operated several successful small businesses, worked and volunteered in not-for-profits, in health, the arts, tertiary education and more, focusing on governance and on social and economic participation. As a working, parenting adult, I earned undergraduate and postgraduate university and coveted industry qualifications, securing the tools that I've since known have served me well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In life, education and work, success has not just been mine. I am here because of those who gave unwavering support in regular, reliable and sufficient measure and also, somewhat ironically, by those who did not. When the detractors, the hecklers and the naysayers told me my dreams were impossible, unachievable or simply unlikely my response was, quite quickly: 'Sit back; watch carefully. They are not.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Standing six feet tall, 183 centimetres, I am used to references in relation to height, so it is with that that I acknowledge those who stood beside me, behind me and in front of me and whose shoulders I leaned on, almost cried on, but most definitely stood on, to get here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my grandparents, who have long since passed, who laboured to build vast pastoral empires on country to which they will forever belong: Corporal Harold Liddle enlisted to fight under the Australian flag and on behalf of that flag for what then was King and country. His sacrifice is rightly forever remembered. To my mum and dad, Geoff and Jean, watching from their home in Alice Springs—Arrernte country: I watched you show up, stand up, speak up time and again with courage and conviction. Together you've defied the narrative, the stereotypes, the statistics, holding sacred belief in individual responsibility, reward for hard work, a fair go and being the masters of your own destiny. From the stars up above and from the Senate gallery and across this country and the globe are the children and grandchildren who have benefited from observing those values. My older sister worked in education and administration before her potential for greater contribution was cut short by a despicable act of violence that killed her. My younger sister joined the South Australian police as a police officer, completed a science degree and an honours law degree and is now contributing to the area of justice to tackle injustice. Another younger sister completed a degree in agricultural science, then a PhD in environmental science, to further enhance her love, understanding and respect for traditional Aboriginal land management practice. The youngest of our clan, my brother—who's actually made it here—has possibly the highest level of responsibility. He's flown in the skies in a now 30-year career as a captain—in fact, a training captain—for a major international airline.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My parents knew that structural, emotional and economic barriers and challenges were real for everyone but could be overcome by commitment to a very good plan and support from decent, good people. Indulge me as I thank my own family: my partner of 30 years and our children, who I have been asked not to name for fear of embarrassing them. I love you more than you could possibly imagine. I thank aunts, uncles, nannas, extended family, and dearest friends old and new too numerous to name, many of whom have been on this long journey and have been forgiving and patient.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the Liberal broad church: thank you for backing me to back enduring belief in freedom; to choose our way of life and living, subject, of course, to the rights of others; for backing individual initiative and enterprise, freedom of speech, religion and association. To the many volunteers who supported the campaign: this was simply not possible without you. I acknowledge especially the work of Liberal members and senators representing South Australia who helped voters make the decision to deliver a sixth senator for the state. I acknowledge all senators who welcomed me here and the work of parliamentary staff who settled me in. Fellow South Australians: now elected, I turn to the responsibility of representing you faithfully with clarity and confidence.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My South Australia is a state of more than 1.8 million people who live beside the mighty River Murray, the imposing Flinders Ranges and on the shores of the Southern Ocean. We have the rolling hills of Adelaide and the Fleurieu Peninsula, stunning Kangaroo Island as well as the City of Adelaide, once awarded one of the world's most livable cities. We're already known for our world-class food and wine regions, our rich and vibrant arts and cultural scene, tourist attractions and experiences. We're a place of imagination and invention. Think the Hills Hoist clothesline, container deposit schemes, the stump-jump plough and David Unaipon's shearing handpiece.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's people with confidence and capability, and the right legislation and policy levers, that will unleash the full capability of systems, processes, environments and infrastructure. So based on my personal story, my values and political party, you will see me on my feet for a robust economy, not just for today but for tomorrow; stability and certainty for business; lower taxes and less red tape; good service delivery and accountability; data monitoring and outcomes; strong borders to protect our people, industry and native flora and fauna; safer streets, communities, homes and workplaces, no matter your postcode, culture or income; and a sensible, measured approach to addressing the issues around climate that considers diversity, and who and how people are affected differently and disproportionately.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More locally, my home South Australia is at the forefront of building Australia's sovereign defence capabilities, building what we need to help keep us safe. Critical to our security and prosperity is the coalition's belief that South Australia should lead the creation and delivery of our vital defence and associated industries. I will be a strong advocate for growing South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our food, wine, wool, grain, meat and seafood industries and advanced manufacturing have unprecedented workforce vacancies that must be filled to reflect the diversity of South Australians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving now from productivity to people: Australians have contacted me lamenting the devastation and chaos they know will revisit their lives with the intended removal of the cashless debit card. The card is an important part of a broader suite of solutions. It gives power and respite to the most vulnerable men, women and children and the elderly—yes, those who need it most—and it is those people, not the drinkers and drug users, not the abusers, who will suffer the most from its withdrawal. Indeed, in response to what is a philosophical objection to the card, residents living in areas from Queensland, Central Australia, the Kimberley, Ceduna and surrounds, despite raising their concerns, are not being heard on this matter. Instead, the people who are being heard are those screaming human rights. But I say: whose rights are they defending? Maybe you need to live in a town devastated by alcohol, drugs and violence and see it eroded from within. Not convinced yet? Keep walking in my shoes, having helped care for foster children—yes, wards of the state. That may help you come to a different conclusion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've looked after a child—hello, Joe—now a man who has fetal alcohol syndrome, never able to live with his parents. Yes, he's had some big hurdles, but he's recently graduated with a certificate IV and is still in work. I'm here to tell you, his family and the families who raised him couldn't be more proud of him. And yet, another child, again from a remote community who lost his mother to alcohol-fuelled dysfunction now lives forever with the consequences of that. So, rather than unleashing the rivers of alcohol and drugs, and with it more associated abuse and neglect, how about ridding our communities of the miscreants, pretenders, controllers and rescuers? Leave them nowhere to hide or thrive. You know who they are, the ones that are there for the ride, for the cultural immersion, or where their apathy and paralysis prevail. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our regulators and our government officials, need to do their jobs better and reward those people working hard to work against the tide of culture of mediocrity and keep only those people delivering outcomes who we know are there for the right reasons. So it was with frustration that I watched on, quarantined by COVID, as the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response) Bill passed this house. In relation to Aboriginal community controlled service delivery, I paraphrase subsection 2, clause (a), which does not require the governing board to have a majority of independent executive directors; (b) have at least one member of the governing body of the provider having experience in the provision of clinical care. Clinical care is assistance with mobility, communication, catheter care, wound management and more. It is one of eight aged-care quality standards for safe and quality care and service identified in the aged-care quality standards commission. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The passing of this legislation means Aboriginal community controlled organisations do not have to meet those requirements in the same way as everyone else. Despite caring for the most vulnerable of the most vulnerable, clients with multiple and complex chronic illness and lower life expectancy and in the most isolated regions, there is no expectation of even partial transition to a model that satisfies that standard. Go your hardest if you think that this pushback is racist, ill-conceived, ill-informed or unreasonable because I'll continue to call out the double standards and disturbing assumptions, and what I call reverse racism. More broadly, I want our country to think different, act different, demand different, push away from the pressure of sameness, the rejection of discourse, the perils of groupthink, reject overpolicing of language, cancel culture and aggressive social media commentary. All that does is conjure ridicule, create fear and stifle our potential to do better. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want this country to stop doing what doesn't or won't work, have higher expectations, be tolerant of mistakes and missteps, and admit when we get it wrong and celebrate when we get it right. I get angry when others seek to define me firstly or only by race, and I know from experience it is getting worse. I was not an Indigenous news reporter, nor an Indigenous businesswoman, or an Indigenous company board director. I had the same qualifications and experiences as everybody else. First and foremost, I am just me. I look forward to objecting loudly to navel-gazing, paternalism, box-ticking, quasi-consultation, silly reporting that returns little value, and ideas that fail to provide evidence of change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm inspired by the words said in 1942 by Liberal Sir Robert Menzies, pushing back on government that seeks to control and limit freedom, one which seeks to nurse us, rear us, control us, maintain us, pension us and bury us. In short, give me the tools and information I need to make decisions and to prepare for my own future and help me only when I truly need it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Neville Bonner made history with his first speech 51 years ago this week on 8 September. A Liberal senator, he was the first Aboriginal person to enter federal parliament in a casual vacancy and later by popular vote. He believed the interests of Indigenous Australians would best be advanced by working within the existing political institutions, and he lamented the much too unwarranted focus on race: 'I am Bonner, proudly an Aborigine and a member of the Australian community. A token of no person.' I acknowledge his contribution and that of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander politicians of all political persuasions, both past and present. My identity is with Arrernte of Central Australia—the cultural group of both of my parents. With that, I acknowledge the people and land of the Ngunnawal people, on which this House now lies, and pay respects to the ancestors and elders past and present.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk more about equity, because it is good for individuals. It's good for our nation, and it's good for our future. I think perhaps some of the most rewarding work I've done to date is in helping others into work. But from here I can encourage that on a much bigger scale. It is in everyday workplaces that sameness, the sharing at water coolers, meeting rooms or boardrooms and having the same qualifications and, yes, the same expectations that destroy stereotypes based on disability, race, age, culture or religion. And all workforces and workplaces must be safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Chief People and Performance Officer at Voyage's Ayers Rock Resort, with around a thousand employees, the target was also to employ 400 Indigenous Australians, around 40 per cent of the workforce at Santos—yes, Santos—I had companywide functional oversight on matters related to Aboriginal affairs in employment and training, community investment and cultural heritage. The target was over 700 outcomes in the energy sector, and that was long ago. With opposition leader Peter Dutton, I recently visited Intract, an Aboriginal owned and operated company. It was Santos that gave Intract its first major project, which now employs 75 Aboriginal employees, 90 per cent of them Indigenous. With a target of five per cent by 2030, it won't be the Public Service that will deliver these jobseekers work. Instead, look to the private sector, where they have already delivered well beyond single-digit outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, we need to teach what it takes for bystanders to speak up and push back regardless of how inconvenient or uncomfortable. That's in our workplaces, in our individual lives, in everything we do—and we'll be better for it. Although our television, radio, newspapers and social media echo loudly the tales of panic, dread and doom, I am confident ordinary Australians—the battlers, the fighters—are ready for a sensible, measured conversation on tough matters of mutual and country interest. Having worked on projects to provide protection for vulnerable and threatened species, I too have great interest in the environment, but not in a way that supports hands glued to sidewalks to stop others going about their business or stands in the way of agreements struck with traditional owners under their right to negotiate legally, transparently, freely and with informed consent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Common sense beats the emotional and the hysterical on every issue every time. Listen—you can already hear the click of the keyboards, the ping of the posting and the landslide of protest. I make a commitment to myself that when I start each new day, every day, my message to self is rightly quite simple. In opposition, I will relish working with colleagues to hold this government to account for its promises, legislation and policy in this chamber, in committees and in the public domain. I can't change yesterday, but today I might just help change tomorrow, and that's what I will stand for in this place.Thank you.</span>

The Australian Labor Party has made a choice, and that choice is to adopt holus-bolus Scott Morrison's $240 billion worth of tax cuts for the top end—for the billionaires, for the politicians, for the CEOs. I say 'Scott Morrison's tax cuts', and of course they were designed by him, as Treasurer, and introduced by him, as Prime Minister. But, as of today, they are the Australian Labor Party's tax cuts; they belong now to the Australian Labor Party. And the choice in adopting those tax cuts—those obscene $240 billion tax cuts for the top end—that Labor has made, is stuck, because this is the Labor Party that has made it clear that folks who are on JobSeeker will be condemned to abject poverty; they will be condemned to starvation rations; they will be condemned to having to make a choice every week about whether to put food on the table or to pay their rent or pay their power bills.</span>

And what's their excuse? 'Oh, they're legislated, and we're not going to re-litigate that,' said the Prime Minister at the Press Club last week. Well, a little bit of educative work here for the Australian Labor Party: section 1 of the Australian Constitution vests the legislative power of the Commonwealth in—wait for it—the federal parliament. Section 51(ii) of the Australian Constitution gives—who? Wait for it—the federal parliament the power to make taxation laws. And the federal parliament has the power to—do you know what?—repeal taxation laws, and that is exactly what we've got the numbers to do, and the only thing stopping the repeal of these obscene stage 3 tax cuts is the Australian Labor Party.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just before I came into this place as a senator I was a secondary high school teacher in a public school. I taught students whose families are doing it tough in this cost-of-living crisis. I taught students who are working four or five nights a week—not for pocket money, but to help put food on the table for their families. Those students come to school tired. They don't have time to do their assignments, and they do poorly on their exams, because they are working to help support their families. That should not be happening in a rich country like this. I taught students who came to school hungry because their parents or their carers were on JobSeeker and their families did not have enough money to put food on the table. Again, that should not be happening in a rich country like this. Students who are hungry find it very difficult to learn. They, too, suffer when they are sitting assessments and doing homework and exams. I taught students whose families were living in a shed. I taught students who were living in the open air under houses. I taught students whose families were living in cars.</span>

It is reprehensible. It is obscene. How about we take that $244 billion and we raise JobSeeker so that families and their kids can afford to eat? How about we take that money and we put it into housing so that students and their families have a roof over their heads? And how about we take that money and we properly fund public education so that every kid in this country has the same opportunities for a good life?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  I present <span style="font-style:italic;">Scrutiny digest</span> No. 4 of 2022 of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, and I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills performs the vital role of examining all bills introduced into the parliament against a set of technical principles set out in standing order 24. These principles focus on the effect of proposed legislation on parliamentary scrutiny and individual rights, liberties and obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the committee does not consider the policy merits of bills or acts. As a result of this approach, the committee has a strong and longstanding commitment to non-partisanship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the committee identifies potential scrutiny concerns with a bill, its usual process is to write to the relevant minister requesting information in relation to those concerns or requesting that certain actions be undertaken by the minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If ministerial responses are not provided within the requested time frame this can significantly impact the committee's ability to report on its scrutiny concerns while a bill is still before the parliament. The committee's expectation is therefore that responses be received from ministers in a timely fashion and prior to the bill being brought on for debate in the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Digest 4 of 2022 reports on the committee's consideration of 39 bills which were introduced into the parliament between 26 July and 4 August 2022 or restored to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> during that period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has identified potential scrutiny concerns in relation to 13 bills, including seven private senators' and private members' bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular I wish to highlight the committee's comments in chapter 1 of the digest regarding the Aged Care Amendment (Implementing Care Reform) Bill 2022. Item 2 of schedule 1 to that bill introduces proposed subsection 54-1A into the Aged Care Act 1997. That section would require an approved provider to ensure that at least one registered nurse is on site and on duty at all times at an aged-care residential facility. This new requirement would apply to all approved providers who are providing residential care or flexible care at a residential facility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has technical scrutiny concerns in relation to proposed subsections 54-1A(3) and (4) of the bill. These subsections provide a broad power to grant exemptions to the new registered nurse requirement using delegated legislation. The bill does not set out any detailed criteria to limit this broad instrument-making power, nor does the face of the bill include any guidance as to how the power may be exercised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has therefore requested the minister's advice as to why it is considered necessary to confer such broad instrument-making powers on the minister in relation to granting exemptions to this new requirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has also asked the minister whether the bill can be amended to include at least high-level guidance on the face of the bill as to the circumstances in which an exemption may be granted and general guidance in relation to the conditions which may apply to an exemption. For example, the committee has suggested that it may be appropriate to include a requirement that any exemption is no longer valid if the circumstances under which it was originally granted no longer exist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, and as I have already noted, the committee's concerns relate to matters of technical scrutiny. The committee does not express a view as to the underlying policy of a bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, I note that two bills highlighted within digest 4 passed shortly after they were introduced. While the committee works to ensure that its comments on bills are available to all senators prior to the passage of a bill, this may not always be possible where bills are passed in short time frames. Bills which pass within short time frames can therefore significantly impact upon the technical scrutiny process of the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response) Bill 2022 passed both houses of parliament on 2 August, after being introduced the previous week. While the committee welcomed the inclusion of provisions within that bill which limited the scope of a broad power to delegate administrative powers, the committee also had significant scrutiny concerns in relation to other provisions within the bill. For example, the committee had significant concerns in relation to a provision which provides immunity from civil and criminal prosecution to individuals who have used restrictive practices on individuals within aged-care homes who lacked capacity to give informed consent. As the bill passed within a short time frame, the committee was not able to publish its comments on this and other provisions in time for consideration by the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee looks forward to engaging constructively with new ministers and other bill proponents in 47th Parliament to facilitate the resolution of technical legislative scrutiny concerns prior to the passage of bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With these comments, I commend the committee's <span style="font-style:italic;">Scrutiny </span><span style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span style="font-style:italic;">igest</span> No. 4 of 2022 to the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Question agreed to.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This committee is one of the Senate's oldest and most respected standing committees. It performs the important role of examining all instruments made under the authority of acts of the parliament which are of a legislative character.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee engages in the technical scrutiny of delegated legislation in accordance with the scrutiny principles set out in standing order 23. These principles focus on compliance with statutory requirements, principles of parliamentary oversight and the protection of individual rights and liberties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This monitor reports on the committee's consideration of 825 legislative instruments registered on the Federal Register of Legislation between 26 February and 26 July 2022. This includes 656 disallowable instruments and 169 instruments exempt from disallowance. It also details the committee's ongoing consideration of instruments registered in previous periods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this monitor, the committee is seeking advice from ministers in relation to 13 instruments. The committee is raising initial concerns in relation to eight instruments, and seeking further advice in relation to five instruments previously considered. I wish to particularly highlight the committee's comments in relation to four of these instruments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first instrument is the Financial Framework (Supplementary Powers) Amendment (Prime Minister and Cabinet's Portfolio Measures No. 2) Regulations 2022. This instrument amends the Financial Framework (Supplementary Powers) Regulations 1997 to establish legislative authority for government spending on the Australian Future Leaders Program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scrutiny of instruments made under the Financial Framework (Supplementary Powers) Act 1997 is a key aspect of parliamentary scrutiny and control of Commonwealth expenditure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this instance, the explanatory statement to the instrument specifies the amount that will be spent on the program but does not appear to include the eligibility criteria for the program, and it is unclear to the committee if the criteria will be made public. The status of both the relevant expenditure and of the grant recipient who will deliver the program is also unclear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has therefore resolved to seek advice from the new Minister for Finance as to whether the eligibility criteria can be made publicly available, whether funding authorised by the instrument has been expended on the program, the status of the entity to which funding has been provided, and whether this information can be included in the explanatory statement to promote parliamentary oversight of Commonwealth expenditure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Renewable Energy Agency Amendment (Clean Energy Technologies) Regulations 2022 were made and registered prior to prorogation of the previous parliament. This instrument has since been superseded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Amendment (Powering Australia) Regulations 2022, made under the new government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Both instruments seek to prescribe additional functions of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA. The most recent instrument seeks to prescribe 'electrification technologies' and 'energy efficiency technologies' as functions of ARENA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the information provided in the explanatory statement, it remains unclear to the committee whether the prescribed functions fall within the scope of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Act 2011, under which the instruments have been made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate has previously disallowed instruments which sought to prescribe ARENA's functions due to related concerns. The committee has therefore resolved to seek the minister's further advice about this matter and the extent of consultation undertaken in drafting the most recent instrument.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the committee has resolved to seek further advice about the Financial Sector Reform (Hayne Royal Commission) Response (Hawking of Financial Products) Regulations 2021. The instrument amends the Corporations Regulations to create an exemption to the prohibition on hawking financial products in the Corporations Act 2001. The Corporations Regulations are not subject to sunsetting. Consequently, the exemption to primary legislation made by the instrument will remain in place indefinitely, unless later amended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee engaged in extensive correspondence with the former Treasurer about this instrument. The committee's longstanding view is that delegated legislation should not be used to create exemptions to primary legislation. Where it is absolutely necessary to use delegated legislation for this purpose, the committee considers that the relevant exemption should be time limited to facilitate regular parliamentary scrutiny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the committee's previous engagement with the former Treasurer, it was unable to resolve its concerns and recommended the Senate disallow the instrument. As a disallowance motion was unresolved when the previous parliament was prorogued, the instrument was deemed to be tabled again in the Senate on the first sitting day of the new parliament, and the disallowance period now expires on 25 October 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has therefore resolved to seek the new Treasurer's advice in relation to whether the relevant exemptions can be time limited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With these comments, I commend the committee's <span style="font-style:italic;">Delegated </span><span style="font-style:italic;">legislation monitor</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> No.</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">5 of 2022</span> to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to continuously improving and adapting to the needs of currently serving defence personnel, veterans and families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Families play a pivotal role in supporting our current serving Australian Defence Force personnel and veterans. The nature of military life is unique, and families can also be deeply affected by military service. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For most veteran families, military service is a largely positive experience. However, some may need support to manage challenging life circumstances such as mental or physical health episodes or sudden, significant events such as loss of employment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian community has a clear expectation that veterans and their families will be well looked after. This is an important task and responsibility of government—a solemn commitment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That's why it's disappointing the former Liberal-National Government did not deliver on its incarnation of this commitment, failing to get legislation passed in the 46th Parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This legislation goes further than what was previously proposed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It will enhance the existing program by expanding services available to families in times of crisis and allowing families greater choice in how they use those services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It will better equip working age families to adjust to new or challenging life circumstances when they occur and also in the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This legislation will better improve support for families who are bereaved, and those who are in crisis—no matter the nature of that crisis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We want to ensure supports are wrapped around families when they need it—and quickly. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am pleased to be introducing this legislation today, as it demonstrates the new Australian Labor Government's commitment to addressing the veteran crisis, providing greater support to defence and veteran families and delivering a better future for veterans and families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill implements an initiative to expand the existing program that provides support for families of those who have provided service to our nation—their husbands, wives, partners, fathers, mothers and children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is support like gardening—to take the pressure off when families have bigger things to think about. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's childcare—so families dealing with the loss of a family member have some back up. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Or indeed, to support parents with their caring responsibilities when one gets sick and can't care for their kids. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's counselling, to expand access to support for family members when they need it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, this support will not be dictated to families. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Every crisis is different and every family circumstance unique. We know that families deserve more than a cookie cutter approach, they deserve services personalised to their needs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That's what this legislation allows. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">49 widowed partners and their families, and 120 veterans and their families, have been assisted by the existing package over the program's lifetime. Approximately 430 families and 450 widowed partners are expected to benefit from the acute support package in the first year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Families make a significant contribution to the health and wellbeing of our Australian Defence Force members throughout their careers, their transition from service, and their lives beyond the military. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The role of family can be especially important in the treatment and recovery of ill or injured individuals throughout their life. Families are also impacted by the unique nature of military service.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill responds to Recommendation 19 of the Final Report of the Senate Inquiry into Suicide by Veterans and Ex-Service Personnel, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Constant Battle: Suicide by Veterans</span>. It also responds to recommendation 19.2 of the Productivity Commission Report <span style="font-style:italic;">A Better Way to Support Veterans</span>, going further than the recommendation to ensure veterans and their families are well supported.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">If a family lives in a town house or apartment, they don't need gardening, but may need support for their child experiencing mental health concerns. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">A young veteran living with his parents, experiencing mental health episodes that mean his mother has moved to part time work to provide more care for the veteran, can nominate his mother to receive support such as counselling or help around the home, to help her cope with her caring role. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The partner of a veteran who has left the relationship recently because of domestic violence will be eligible for support direct from the Department of Veterans' Affairs, without the veteran being notified or required to do anything, protecting her safety and supporting her to establish a new life.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A single parent veteran whose child is struggling at school academically and socially due to mental health concerns, can access tutoring support for the child and other counselling and wellbeing supports for the child and themselves to help them support their child.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A recently widowed partner of a veteran can access cleaning, gardening and meal preparation to assist them at a time when doing the day to day things seem impossible and they need to focus on themselves and their children. </span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When debate was interrupted, I was making a point around what motivates a government to want to disempower an entity such as the ABCC that has done such important work protecting employees on worksites, as we've had many examples of throughout the course of this debate. I don't intend to go over all of the examples that have been provided, although it is important to reflect on how appalling some of those examples are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we go to cast our votes on this disallowance motion, it's important—and my colleagues have made this point before—to reflect on what it is we are actually doing here. The government seeks to take away from the ABCC powers which protect employees from terrible behaviour.</span>

                    </a>  They seek to gut it, as Senator Scarr says. But I don't understand why. At this time, in this political environment, in the world we live in today, workers' rights—the right to feel safe, the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of a particular attribute, be it your sexual orientation, your gender or any other factor—are something that I thought everyone in this place, including government members, thought was universally important. I'm struggling to think of a workplace where it is deemed appropriate to do the things that have been cited in the examples given by my colleagues who've already made contributions—to make homophobic slurs, to make sexist remarks, to intimidate people with reference to one or more of their personal attributes. Which workplace is it in which that is okay?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we don't support this disallowance, we are saying that it's okay to do this in the construction industry, that it is okay to turn a blind eye to the claims that have been made and that that is somehow okay behaviour. What message does it send when, here in this place, we seek to ensure that we lead, set the standard and make sure that workers in all industries can go to work and feel safe, no matter who they are, what sexual orientation they have or what gender they have? Again, I am mystified as to why the government would seek to take away these powers from the ABCC. What is it?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is more disturbing is a number of the contributions I've heard in this debate that have talked about why we would think it's okay to do so by minimising the work of the ABCC, trivialising it and claiming that all the ABCC ever did was go after people with stickers on helmets.</span>

                    </a>  To be fair, they were hung up the right way.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator DUNIAM:</span>
                    </a>  Indeed, as Senator Hughes says, they might have been hung the right way, but the reality is that that is not the bulk of the work that we have been seeing the ABCC focus on. The safety and the integrity of the workplace, the rights of workers to go about what it is they seek to honestly do without fear of persecution, fear of bullying from others and from union thugs—this is a kind of thing that this entity has been focused on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are economic consequences that flow from a decision of this nature, and we've seen it all before, because, of course, history is repeating itself. We've had the abolition of this entity before and we know what happened in the workplace. We know what happened to the economic performance of this sector. We know how many days were lost. There were almost quadruple the days lost on worksites because of the Labor decision to abandon workers and leave them to the mercy of union thugs who have nothing at heart other than their own interests: power in the workplace and, of course, a union we've heard many times over call the shots within the Australian Labor Party. I think it is wrong for anyone who doesn't support this disallowance motion to try to minimise what it is that we are seeking to do here—to try to equate the work of the ABCC to simply pursuing a union that placed stickers on helmets and hung flags. What madness. I think people know enough about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We only have to look at some of the activities that have been pursued by the ABCC, and I turn to my home state of Tasmania. There was a case in 2017 in which a senior official of the CFMMEU was done for unlawful action and putting workers' safety in 'harm's way'—at an excellent project, actually: the Devonport Living City project, a project funded by the Australian government and one that has made a tremendous difference to the regional economy of the north-west cost. The official in question put the safety of workers at risk by climbing into the cabin of a crane while it was being operated. The same official again climbed into the cabin the very next day while the crane was being operated, again compromising workers' safety. This, it was claimed by this official, was done to inform the worker of their rights. I'm not sure why you'd have to interrupt a shift by hopping into the cab of a crane while it's operating to inform someone of their rights in the workplace. Why they couldn't wait until the end of the shift I'm not 100 per cent sure. And there were signs around saying that there was to be no unauthorised interruption of the operator during crane operation—and we are all about workplace safety; at least, I thought unions were, and the party that they are most closely aligned to. A $137,000 fine was taken to the CFMMEU for this particular conduct. The same official appears in a number of other cases related to Tasmania, and in our state, sadly, there are countless examples of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another official, in 2019, was accused of wilfully contravening right-of-entry laws and intimidating managers at a Hobart construction site. The court found that this individual did not hold a federal right-of-entry permit, erroneously claimed that the site had asbestos issues, and returned five days later and said to the head of contractor staff, 'Don't get smart with me'—deleted expletive here—'I'm at the end of my career and I don't give an F what happens to me, but that bloke over there will', pointing to another official: 'He can do whatever he F-ing well likes.' It is that sort of behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that people who represent workers, through unions or other organisations, feel strongly about what it is that they do. But if anyone in this place can point to that behaviour—the examples that have been provided to my colleagues—and say, 'Hey, that's okay in any workplace'—I defy anyone who can do that. If we did it in our workplaces, I expect we'd be called out for it. In fact, I'm pretty sure that has been happening. There's been a high degree of interest in the safety of workplaces, be it in the political realm, the private sector, the public sector or wherever it is; you name it. And rightly so. Workers need to be protected in the workplace, and of course that's what the ABCC has been doing—day in, day out—and all of this against the backdrop of an economy that needs every bit of turbocharging it can get to ensure that jobs aren't lost and costs don't go up. When it comes to the construction sector, this is especially important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the ABCC is no longer doing its work, who is going to protect these workers? Do we honestly believe we aren't going to see a return to the bad old days of the last time this happened? And here we are, in the first 110 days of this government, and this is a top priority—to gut, as Senator Scarr said, the ABCC, to enable the CFMMEU to continue to do what it is they do with flagrant disregard for the law and absolutely no regard for the rights of these employees of various construction businesses across the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, again, as I say, I'm just absolutely mystified at how anyone could vote against this disallowance. To those who claim to come into this place to stand up for workers' rights, to make sure that this is a country in which people can work, go out and seek to earn an honest living and get home safely at the end of the day, why on earth is this sort of behaviour—just a couple of very brief and minor examples compared to some of the other ones that have been referred to by my colleagues—okay? Is it okay at other workplaces? No, it certainly is not. So why, therefore, is it okay for the CFMMEU to continue to do this?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back to those who seek to vote against this disallowance, I did listen to the debate as the bulk of it took place over the last couple of days, and I think I might've counted two or three contributions of people speaking against it. It made me wonder why. Why aren't people defending the decision to gut the ABCC? Why is it that they are just hoping this will disappear, that the disallowance will get voted down, the CFMMEU can get back to business and its officials can get back to abusing people on work sites, denigrating people and making homophobic slurs, misogynistic remarks, sexist remarks, things that you would just never deem acceptable in any other workplace? They are hoping, their mates in the CFMMEU, the Australian government want this disallowance knocked off so that they can just can get back to business, and hopefully nothing more will be said about it between now and the next election. That's what they're after. That's what they're hoping for. I urge senators to vote for this disallowance so that we can actually protect workers in this industry. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  News this week that the Labor government would ban live sheep exports sent a shiver up the spines of every grazier in Australia. There is absolutely no doubt that banning sheep exports would open the door to banning live cattle exports, crippling the $2 billion live export industry and the 10,000 jobs it supports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Animal welfare is at the forefront of our live export trade. We banned the shipment of sheep to the Middle East during the northern hemisphere summer. And the official mortality rate of sheep being transported is just 0.2 per cent, and dropping each year; for cattle, it's 0.1 per cent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Research is already being conducted into using cameras on ships to enhance monitoring of animals on their journey. Animal health is the top consideration at every step of the supply chain, from the farm to feedlots to the ship. Participants in the live export trade are constantly scrutinised and face exclusion if they fail to meet the high standards set by industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another consideration ignored by activists is that, of the hundred countries exporting live animals, Australia has the highest standards in the world. Not only that, we're the only country in the world that demands animal welfare standards from our customers. So we are holding our own people to higher standards and we are exporting these high standards around the world, training receiving countries to improve their own practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If Labor removes Australia from the world live export market we are condemning animals in other countries to exceptionally poor outcomes. After Labor banned live exports in 2011, the backlash from the beef and sheep industries was immense but that hasn't stopped the party from plotting to do it again. In fact, it was left up to animal activists to reveal Labor's plans show the live export ban was being orchestrated to avoid scrutiny before the election. This policy by stealth is disgraceful and entirely in keeping with Labor's campaign strategy of, 'We have a plan, but we won't tell you the details until you vote for us.' Also concerning is Labor's plan for the demise of live exports without consulting with industry, relying instead on the emotion charged, biased arguments by activists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Live export has enormous benefits for all of Australia, not just regional areas. The Townsville port is Australia's largest live export hub, supporting hundreds of jobs in Australia's unofficial northern capital. Live exports also go through Broome, Darwin and Fremantle. The northern cattle industry supports city based transport companies and truck drivers. Graziers spend their incomes in cities, and the taxes they pay benefit us all. Primary production is hugely important for all of Australia. It is sustainable and it is in demand by scrupulous foreign customers, but Labor treats it like an afterthought. Without a strong ag sector, Australia will go backwards and that will affect everyone, no matter where you live. For Australian graziers, life will not be easy under Albanese.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The live animal export trade is important not just to Australian graziers and farmers; it is terrifically important to our near neighbours. The overnight banning of that export market has damaged our relationship with Indonesia beyond repair. Over 10 years later, that country still treats us with distrust. It resulted in an over $2 billion bill for this incoming government, both for damages at the time to graziers, transport operators and other businesses in the north, as well as the growing interest bill that needs to be paid to those people. We saw poor animal welfare outcomes because of the overnight cancellation, not to mention the massive mental health bill that was inflicted on all sorts of businesses, graziers and families in the north. It was just a horrific time. It was certainly devastating to see how those people who attended those public forums had been affected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Live animal export fills a portion of the market that is not just about exporting food, which is so incredibly important. Food security has been identified by the US Secretary of State at the recent UN world peace conference as one of the most significant issues facing us in our time. Food security for Australians and for our near neighbours is of critical importance, and the part we have to understand about live animal exports is that it is not just about receiving the best quality food that we grow here in Australia. It is also about being cognisant of religious requirements in those countries. This is something that we don't have to understand here, but in those countries, to receive live animals suitable for their markets to be killed and eaten in an appropriate way is significant and that is part of the exports we consider when we have a live animal trade. It is not just about food; it is about cultural and religious beliefs. In some parts of the world, it is about the economic conditions. They don't have the electricity and the reliable power to enable them to have the refrigeration and the cold store chains that we enjoy in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So when Australia exports live animals to other countries, there are a number of issues that we are contemplating for our near neighbours and our trade partners. It is important to the relationship that we understand culturally their challenges, economically their challenges and, most importantly, their food requirements, because there is nothing more important in the world than growing and providing food and fibre. That is the human condition. Everything else that we do adds to the quality of life we have, but without food we don't survive. So I'm very proud of the work that, particularly, the sheep industry of Western Australia does, as well as the cattle industry of northern Australia, because they have developed relationships that are beyond just that simple provision of food to suit the human condition. They are relationships and friendships that have now developed over generations as we have done that, and it's important, particularly in this uncertain geopolitical time we live in, that we have strong relationships with our near neighbours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why it was so distressing to see during the close of the last government, when we were negotiating the ag visas so important to agricultural businesses right across this country—whether they be in horticulture, animal production, piggeries or feedlots—that our relationship with the sorts of workforces who were skilled in these expert areas, from Indonesia, from the Philippines and from other near neighbours, was damaged, and it wasn't damaged by activists; it was damaged by the AWU, the Australian Workers Union, who went and lobbied those embassies and said, 'Australian farmers will exploit your people.' What an outrageous thing to do, so un-Australian. It showed such a lack of understanding of the requirements during the post-COVID environment, where workforce shortages have been so difficult that farmers have had to let crops rot on the ground or in trees and not plant as much food as they possibly could, because they didn't feel confident in being able to harvest that at the end of the year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, poor behaviour from some contractors meant the AWU was calling Australian farmers exploiters and saying it was part of business as usual for them. It is shameful, and it has shaken me to the core to understand that people who advocate for Australians, Australian businesses and Australian workers could so wilfully undermine our industry, our own people—and not just Australians but our near neighbours—who do the important work of growing food and fibre. How shocking it is to hear Labor continue these outrageous claims that the reason the ag visa did not get up was anything apart from their own henchmen going around lobbying and bullying embassies and calling our farmers exploiters. It was truly a very dark day in Australia's history and certainly in agricultural history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the work of Australian farmers as they not only export food and fibre to our near neighbours but understand and are sympathetic to the cultural differences of our near neighbours and understand the economic environment, where there may not be good cold storage chains for the people we're supplying food to. There are a whole lot of businesses that also spring up around live animal exports. Once the animals arrive in those countries, farmers might take two or three head to fatten in their own mini feedlots. These are important parts of the industry and commerce of those towns. Then Australia does the most important thing of all: we export our very high animal welfare standards. Our closed supply chain in those countries means we demand the same export standards in our receiving countries as we demand in our own country. Whether it be in the way animals are cared for or whether it be in the process of slaughter, we demand they stand up to the same rigorous requirements we have in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For anybody to suggest that's not the case just flies in the face of the science and the research that has been handled both by the department of agriculture and by industry groups, and the fact that we had whistleblowers being paid for their photos, their evidence, is just extraordinary. If in any other situation you discovered the person giving evidence was being paid to provide evidence, you would call into question the whole credibility of that complaint. That's exactly what we've relied on in this case. We don't know if they were actually intentionally trying to hurt those animals or trying to make them distressed in order to provide footage for activists' intentions to shut down the very important work that Australian farmers and Australian exporters do in providing food security to these countries, allowing them to eat in a way that is culturally appropriate and in a way that suits the lack of cold store supply chains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I oppose this particular motion because I know that Australian farmers and Australian exporters do hold very high standards. We should feel proud of them. In fact, I would welcome any of these activists or any of the members opposite to go and visit a live export ship, to go and visit with the farmers and graziers who take their stock there, to travel on the ship and to see just how excellent and expert the ships, the staff and the inspectors are. I think the advent of trialling having remote cameras on ships is an extraordinary development because it shows how transparent the industry can be. Right around the world, we have just lived through a period of remote everything—remote schooling, remote meetings, remote leisure activities—and now we can even remotely watch stock as they travel across the seas to our trade partners, and we can be assured of the high standards under which they are being looked after.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just can't believe this, with all the work that is done in this regard—With the Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports, with the independent observers and of course with those very, very important trade relations with our near neighbours in this time when food security is the No. 1 issue that is affecting countries. We know that when people feel insecure, when food supply is threatened, it is the most dangerous thing we can do to our trade relationships. We saw it in Indonesia, and that trade relationship has barely recovered. I fear for the outcomes that would happen if we were to close down this very appropriate live export industry with sheep, this very high standard of export, the very tight restrictions that we have on weight and standards. Anybody who thinks we're killing the sheep has never been on a ship and has never been to see the standards. They are so poorly informed that they should hang their heads in shame at their criticisms of the standards that we uphold. I can only ask them: please, go on a ship. Go out and see what actually happens. Stop listening to poorly informed activists.</span>

                    </a>  For all of the previous occasions on which we heard from Labor and the Greens how outrageous it was to shut down debate, we now have the remarkable situation where the Greens have just voted to guillotine debate on their own disallowance motion, where they will now sit there and watch Labor come over this side and defeat their disallowance motion. That is how much the Greens are willing to contort themselves in these matters. The Greens are now contorting themselves to shut down debate, in defiance of everything they've have had to say along the way. The Labor Party is shutting down debate on an issue when there are only two speakers left on the list. They couldn't allow another two speeches to proceed before they had to come in here, shut down debate and close things off, in defiance of everything they used to say. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:48</span>):  I rise tonight to speak to the Climate Change Bill 2022 and the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022. The coalition will not support either of these bills. This is legislation that the government's own minister has called 'not necessary'. The minister stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While this legislation is not necessary for the Albanese government to embark on the policy actions we sought and received a mandate for, it is best practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… we have designed our Powering Australia plan so that it can be implemented whether legislation passes or not …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's difficult for me to understand that this remains such a priority for Labor if it's not necessary his legislation will introduce serious externalities. Why impose those consequences on the Australian economy if the legislation is not necessary? Australia has already made known its formal 43 per cent target, regardless of how the parliament deals with this legislation. The government updated Australia's nationally determined contribution, the NDC, in June. One would have thought that the priority of the government would be addressing the inflationary pressure and cost-of-living pressures that Australian families are suffering through. Amidst their broken promise to reduce power bills for families and businesses by $275, they have now overseen the highest electricity prices on record, so I repeat the call of the Leader of the Opposition: if you actually want to help Australians at the moment, keep the promise you've abandoned and reduce their power bills by $275. Rushing to legislate an emissions target does nothing to fulfil that promise. This legislation has serious problems, which will have significant unintended consequences. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want tonight to briefly summarise the coalition's main concerns. We believe that the consultation process overlooks significant stakeholders. The government chose to alleviate itself of rural and regional concerns, instead of properly consulting with those most likely to be impacted. The legislation will invite green activists to enter vexatious claims in our legal system for political purposes. Environmental activist groups could now challenge crucial projects under Commonwealth legislation, potentially delaying or halting them altogether. Furthermore, the coalition believes that the government's Powering Australia plan is not an achievable or genuinely practical plan to firm 80 per cent renewables by 2030. We are, however, concerned that the legislation is neither equitable nor fair. What I mean when I say that is that this legislation gives no consideration to how an increase in power bills could cause economic distress to families or businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills are actually also likely to restrict crucial government agencies such as the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, Infrastructure Australia and Export Finance Australia from supporting projects. Furthermore, there are grave concerns that these restrictions will inhibit our national security and particularly objectives in the Pacific by reducing export financing authorities' flexibility. The coalition believes that the Labor government's continued rejection of sensible debate on the latest-generation nuclear power is disingenuous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stakeholders have spoken to us and to the inquiry that was held. Stakeholders such as the Australian Forest Products Association raised concern with the legislation as it relates to consultation—or rather, I should say, the complete lack of consultation—concerning certain aspects of the bills. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry was not consulted on the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022 prior to its introduction. This bill could have serious impacts on the agricultural industry as an emissions-intensive industry, but the climate change department failed to consult with the agricultural department on how this bill might impact on our primary producers. This leads me to believe that the consultation process failed in its duty to inquire into the manner in which this legislation may impact all communities. The consultation process has heightened concern because of the government's failure to conduct popular socioeconomic modelling. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst providing evidence, the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry admitted they had done no modelling on the impacts of the Climate Change Bill and the consequential amendments bill on rural and regional Australia. The government failed to properly consult on the rural and regional perspective and failed to conduct socioeconomic modelling on the impact it would have on these communities—absolutely disgraceful. Without such processes, these bills may now have provisions that lead to incredibly serious unintended consequences. These are significant oversights on the part of the government, and they should have been addressed. The government should have sought to facilitate genuine consultation and discussion around this legislation. Unfortunately, though, despite the government claiming they would govern under a new style of politics, their haste is an attempt to influence political outcomes and obviate genuine criticism and differing perspectives. As we stated in our dissenting report to the inquiry into these bills, the coalition believes rigorous consultation, modelling and social impact assessments have been overlooked in the drafting and introduction of these bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Labor Party continues to insist on passing this legislation, it will effectively have entered Australia into a new era of green lawfare. The coalition believes that these bills will invite unacceptable and fundamentally vexatious green activism into the courts and our legal system. I note the experience of other countries that have codified into law some of these pieces of legislation. The UK, in particular, has been subject to significant legal consequences as a result of the codification of emissions reduction targets. Activists in the UK have challenged crucial projects such as a new high-speed rail network, challenged government decisions to invest in the maintenance and construction of new roads because this would lead to increased traffic and thus greater emissions, and delayed a third runway at Heathrow Airport for years by challenging it in the court system. The government of France has been ordered to take all necessary measures on climate change by 2022 or it will be subject to penalties by the court. In Germany the courts ordered the government to increase its emissions reductions target. These scenarios have eventuated through the legislation of emissions reductions targets. These are very real scenarios that Australia is facing now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Disappointingly, though, at the inquiry, environmental groups such as Greenpeace and others absolutely refused to rule out using this legislation to challenge agriculture, primary production, infrastructure, energy, resources or forestry projects. The coalition is gravely concerned that these may impact on access to the justice system if the court system is to be used for this. Already many of these projects are subject to significant delays, and allowing the green activism to add to the courts' workload would not be in the interest of our legal system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's target of 43 per cent includes a plan to have 82 per cent renewables, under their Powering Australia plan. The committee inquiry into these bills received evidence that this plan would actually lead to an increase in power bills. So, after breaking their promise of providing families with $275 of relief on their power bills, the government is actually going to be contributing to additional costs to families and businesses. We note the variability of renewables cannot be firmed by current battery storage technology. As outlined in our dissenting report, evidence was provided to the inquiry into these bills that current battery technology could power a city the size of Sydney for seconds if the grid failed. This is especially concerning, given that members of the government continue to demonise fossil fuels. To introduce such significant variability with no visible means with which to firm that technology would be a very large mistake. The coalition also has very serious doubts concerning the Labor government's ability to deliver on its commitment of 82 per cent renewables by 2030. Nuclear for Climate Australia, in their submission to the inquiry into these bills, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… its intended that emissions reductions in electricity generation throughout all sectors of the economy be achieved using renewables with storage. In view of the embodied carbon emissions in wind, solar and storage devices it is physically impossible to achieve net zero using these devices. Their constant replacement, weather dependency and lack of reliability will render methods of negative emissions such as carbon sequestration or atmospheric removal entirely uneconomic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For Australians who are already under constant cost-of-living pressures, any rise in their power bills will have a detrimental impact on their lives. However, this legislation fails to address the economic cost of rising power bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this government has very little concern for families who are managing very expensive power bills. Amidst the highest electricity prices on record, this Labor government has abandoned its '$275 better off' plan for families. They ditched that promise. I believe that one of the primary responsibilities for government when altering energy policy is to ensure that people can keep their lights on, that they can turn the dishwasher on after 6 pm at night and that they can afford to do so. I have said this time and again and will continue to do so. These bills will put pressure on already very high cost-of-living pressures on families. This will potentially inhibit some Australians from being able to afford to keep their lights on, to keep their fridge running, to keep the air conditioning on in summer or the heater on in winter. This will have significant impact on our communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what could be of greater or equal concern is the fact that this legislation could actually inhibit our national security objectives, particularly in the Pacific. Our region, I think everyone would agree, is going through a period of heightened tensions. China has certainly become more assertive in the region and is pushing its objectives into our neighbourhood via the Pacific. We have heard and we believe that reducing Export Finance Australia's ability and flexibility is not in our national interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Export Finance Australia do critical work supporting projects in the Pacific, and, if we don't continue to provide that important support, other countries may attempt to do so on our behalf. Restricting Export Finance Australia's flexibility could lead to exactly that. If we do not support these projects, we could be opening up the door for China to do so. I and the coalition object in the strongest possible terms to any legislation which may negatively impact upon our national security objectives. But it is not just Export Finance Australia; it is also the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility supporting projects in various industries which are considered emissions-intensive. These agencies manage and support the funding of projects which create significant investment, provide economic stimulus and create jobs. But restricting their decision-making is not in the national interest and can inhibit these opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to touch on nuclear energy. For the government, with its Powering Australia plan and its calls for 82 per cent renewables in the grid, to achieve its target of 43 per cent emissions reduction, there needs to be input into the grid, more variability into the grid and it needs to be firm. Given the government's focus on reducing emissions, it would appear to me now that its continued rejection of a genuine debate—that's all, a discussion—on nuclear power is purely ideological. So the coalition urges the government to please engage in sensible discussions with us on these matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing—and I know we have a long night ahead of us, because, again, in transparency, we are going to push this through and maybe guillotine it at some stage—we won't be supporting these bills, because we support Australians. They are founded upon unachievable policy principles, and they will have very, very serious unintended consequences. The government has in no way done adequate consultation. In fact, it looks like they have gone out of their way to not consult those sectors—like agriculture, like primary production, like forestry—that will be so affected by this. They have done no modelling of how this will impact rural and regional communities as they shut down jobs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills will also increase green activism—the lawfare, the lawyers' picnic. The vexatious claims that are about to be launched will be significant. We will see a continual increase in energy prices, and, as I said, this has the potential to have a very significant impact on our ability to further our national security objectives in the Pacific.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:03</span>):  I rise to speak this evening to the Climate Change Bill 2022 and the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022. I note that many of my Greens colleagues have spoken to these bills and done so with eloquence, intelligence and passion. So, while I wish to make a contribution to the debate on these bills, I want to focus on a few key areas. We cannot end the climate wars while opening up new coal and gas projects. It really is that simple. In the month since these bills passed the House of Representatives, Labor has opened up 47,000 square kilometres of ocean to oil and gas exploration. The Prime Minister has said that Australia will keep on selling coal and gas to the world. Queensland Labor has given approval to the New Acland Coal Mine. These are not the actions of a party that is committed to reducing emissions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be extremely clear. The Greens will be supporting these bills, but they are a very small step forward, and Labor has committed to kicking real action on climate change to the kerb. This is a government that is captured by the likes of Woodside, Chevron and Santos. In Western Australia, literally two-thirds of all offshore gas is given away to these companies for free. The state government gets more money from vehicle registrations than it does from gas royalties. Federally, the petroleum resource rent tax is broken. Australian people are paying for the privilege of having our climate destroyed for the sake of multinational profit. That's a disgrace. While these bills go nowhere near far enough, we are pleased to have secured improvements. The Greens have made sure that Labor's unscientific target of 43 per cent is a minimum, and we are aiming to see that target raised substantially. We've made sure that the Climate Change Authority will be guided by the global temperature goals set out in the Paris Agreement. Crucially, large financing bodies such as Export Finance Australia and Infrastructure Australia will have to consider climate targets when financing projects. This is significant, as these bodies have been vehicles for significant fossil fuel financing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the government has agreed to consider our proposals for a national energy transition authority to support coal and gas communities and give them control over their futures as Australia tackles the climate crisis. There is a real opportunity here for collaboration on protecting workers and their communities, and ensuring an equitable transition to renewable energy that ensures well-paid employment and world-class services for those communities. I look forward to working with the government to get this done and to meaningfully deliver for working people in fossil fuel communities like mine. But a national energy transition authority will have its work cut out managing the transition for existing fossil fuel projects. There are 114 coal and gas projects in the pipeline at the moment. Even a single one would blow Labor's target out of the water and make a mockery of any commitment to transitioning workers and their communities. The Labor Party might think that they can keep exporting coal and gas for decades to come, but the reality is that our international partners will stop buying it. If Labor intends to achieve even their inadequate target of 43 per cent, not one of the 114 coal and gas mines currently green-lighted can go ahead. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the Greens will vote for the climate bill, this bill cannot be the be-all and end-all of climate action. We will fight tooth and nail against all new coal and gas projects, and we will make sure that workers engaged in existing fossil fuel projects are protected and given secure, well-paid jobs in their communities.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:08</span>):  I rise to speak on the Climate Change Bill 2022 and the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022. What a historic moment this is, because these bills mark the end of the climate wars in this country, the end of 10 years of inaction and the end of 10 years of division and denial by those opposite. We are in a global race, and now Australia is taking our place in that race—a race to prevent the devastating climate events that are destroying communities and regions here and around the world, and a race to seize the opportunities of a decarbonised world, including bringing the jobs of the renewables future right here to our shores. With the Climate Change Bill that is exactly what we are doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill sends the signal that the Albanese government is committed to action on climate change—a signal that gives certainty to our region, to investors, to Australian businesses, and to this parliament—because this bill is also a commitment that our government will not just announce a target and hope we get there. We won't use accounting tricks or rely on future technologies that may or may not ever exist. We will be held accountable to our targets, and we will deliver our plan to not just meet them but exceed them. We'll report our progress every year to the parliament on meeting the targets and how our policies are contributing to that success. Our government knows Australia should be a renewables superpower. We know Australia should be leading this global race and securing the jobs of the future for Australian workers, and now we can do just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am incredibly proud that my home state of Victoria is leading Australia's transition to the renewables future. The Andrews government, led by Australia's longest serving climate change minister, the Hon. Lily D'Ambrosio, were the one of the first in the world to legislate a net zero emissions by 2050 target. and to make sure those targets are met they've made the largest investment in clean energy of any state ever: $1.6 billion to identify and create renewable energy zones that support businesses, jobs and towns across regional Victoria to transition to new industry, ensuring maximum benefit for local communities by delivering thousands of good secure jobs and billions of dollars in new economic activity. To ensure Victorians are prepared for these new jobs the Andrews government have also introduced a clean energy workforce skills initiative. This is a $10 million initiative that encourages collaboration between the training sector and industry. This will ensure that our training curricula are fit for purpose for the jobs of the future and ensure that Victorian workers have the skills that they need to take up those jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is Labor governments that are leading the way on climate action in this country. It is Labor governments that are delivering on climate action in this country. That is who is delivering on climate action in this country. We are sending a message to the world that now is the time to invest in Australia's transition, attracting large nation-building investments in renewable energy right now, like the Star of the South project off the south coast of Gippsland, which has partnered with the Victorian government to deliver Australia's first offshore wind site. The Star of the South project won't just help Victoria and Australia meet our climate targets; it will create thousands of good secure local jobs. It will support a community transition from fossil fuels to a greener future. The Star of the South is bringing the local community along with it by working with unions and local businesses to ensure that there's an ongoing supply of local jobs and that there is an ongoing supply of local contracts for local communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia, and particularly my home state of Victoria, has an incredible opportunity to establish a significant offshore wind industry, which was held back for so long by the coalition government and their failure to deliver legislation allowing offshore wind even to be considered in Australia. But the Labor government in Victoria didn't let that hold them back, and to make up for lost time as they waited for those opposite to deliver critical legislation to enable offshore wind the Victorian government announced a plan to accelerate the rollout of offshore wind projects. This was a strong message to the world that, if you want to invest in offshore wind, Victoria is the place to be. That message was received loud and clear, with investment now flowing from international and local investors, including industry super funds who are getting involved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The best thing we can do to attract investment in our transition is show the world that we are serious about reducing emissions and that we are serious about becoming the renewables superpower that everyone except those opposite know we can be. There has been a decade of missed opportunities from those opposite to make Australia a global leader and secure Australian jobs in the rapid transition to renewables, including a failure to prioritise Australian-made products. We saw this at the Ryan Corner Wind Farm project, where Keppel Prince, Australia's only manufacturer of wind turbines, were primed and ready to provide the content for this project, but instead they were passed over in favour of imported products and overseas companies, a decision that saw 50 jobs lost in the community of Portland in just three weeks, a devastating blow to that community. This is the legacy that those opposite have left behind: no support for local content, no support for local business, no support for local jobs and no support for local communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians know that under the Albanese government the move to a renewable energy future will create secure jobs for workers here in Australia. Our Powering Australia plan will reduce emissions and help us meet the targets that we are setting today and will create over 600,000 new jobs for Australian workers—600,000 good, secure jobs, many of them in Australia's regions. Five out of six of those new jobs created will be in our regions. And we'll join together the Powering Australia plan and our Buy Australian plan, which will improve the way government contracts work to make sure more opportunities are available to Australian businesses. At the same time, the National Reconstruction Fund will drive new manufacturing jobs in renewables.</span>

We are embracing that opportunity and we are embracing the future.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  I'm very pleased to rise to speak on the Climate Change Bill 2022 and a related bill, because, as I've listened to the speeches today, I've heard very little talk indeed about science. As a matter of fact, I haven't heard even one mathematical equation that underpins any of the science since this whole debate started. But I'll get onto that point in a minute.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to lay down my credentials in terms of how much I care about the environment, and I want to distinguish the environment and my passion for the environment and the Liberal Party's passion for the environment from the shoddy mathematical modelling, indoctrination and intimidation of the climate change propaganda. When it comes to looking after our riparian zones, reducing pollution and looking after our biodiversity and our land management, all these things are very, very important, and I stand with the party. One of the values of the LNP is to protect our environment. But as I stand here I get worried, because I know the damage that these so-called renewables—which aren't renewables; they are reliables—will do to the environment if they go ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give you one example. These windfarms kill both bats and birds. They are killing our apex birds, which feeds down into the food chain, and they're killing our bats. Unbeknown to most people, bats pollinate lots and lots of flowers. So, if we're going to go around killing bats—it's estimated that in the US the windfarms over there kill millions of birds each year along with millions of bats. And it's been known in other countries—in Scotland and places like that. There's a real antiwindfarm sentiment there. They are doing a fantastic job tracking the number of apex birds that are being killed by windfarms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it doesn't just stop with windfarms. It is also a problem with lithium, with these batteries, and the rare earths mining that has to be carried out in order to build a battery. Not many people realise that lithium, for example, is a one per cent ore body. You've got to mine100 tonnes of ore to get one tonne of lithium. But the thing about a mine is that you can't just go and dig the ore body out of the ground; you've got to go around and around and around in order to get to the ore body. That means you've probably got what they call a stripping rate of about 10 to one. So, quite possibly, with many of these lithium mines—and don't forget, that's just one of the many metals that go into a battery—you would have to mine 1,000 tonnes of dirt in order to get one tonne of metal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But here's the rub: you don't just get the one tonne of metal out of the ore that easily; you've got to put it through a number of electrolysis processes to extract the metal from the ore. Once you do that, you then put it on a ship to China, where it then goes into a battery. From that battery, it then goes into—</span>

                    </a>  How about doing it in Australia?</span>
                </p>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator RENNICK:</span>
                    </a>  I don't disagree with that. We should value-add there. But it then goes over to Texas, into a Tesla factory, where it goes into a car, and then the car comes all the way back to Australia and then gets used. That said, the actual power is put into a wall socket, where most of the power actually comes from a coalmine anyway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you compare that to, for example, the Kogan Creek coalmine close to my home town of Chinchilla—it's what you call a mine mouth coalmine, which is where the mine is only four kilometres away from the power station—coal is coal. There is no actual extracting of coal from the ore body. You burn it. You strip it. You mine it. You put it straight into the power station, and the power is transported by the southern interconnector. It is a very efficient way of producing energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it doesn't stop there. These batteries that go into cars weigh up to 700 kilograms. They add a significant amount of weight to a car. They increase the braking distance. They are going to increase accidents. You do not want to get hit by a 700-kilogram solid object. They are going to increase the rubber burn-off in cars and increase the rubber pollutants in the air. This is not going to end well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, you have to build so many more security services in order to deal with the frequency and the volatility control, because we're going to have renewables coming on and off, on and off, on and off. We're going to have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on synchronous condensers. They are these big spinning flywheels that sit on an inverter at the end of the coal-powered fire station, and when there's an overload or a surge of too much energy coming from solar, for example, that power then has to get diverted into the actual spinning wheel. And if there's a dip in the energy, if that spinning wheel is still spinning, you can divert some of that energy back into the grid. But this all requires a lot of extra cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been a lot of false assumptions. For example, the <span style="font-style:italic;">GenCost</span> report assumes that there's no extra transmission required until renewables hit 50 per cent of the grid. That's farcical. The Labor Party have $20 billion for rewiring the actual grid scheme, so that's going to be a loan—I don't know what the conditions of that loan are—and that's going to cost a lot of money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're going to have all of these extra transmission lines across the country. They themselves kill heaps of birds—that's a well-known fact. I can't wait for the farmers to react. There are going to be more and more of these transmission lines, and once they start getting built—I know they're protesting about that in western Victoria at the moment. You're then going to have all these impacts on farmers. You're going to have transmission lines criss-crossing the country. In the old days, when we had 80 per cent of the eastern seaboard powered by coal, we only had about 30 power stations and it was all very efficient when it came to transmission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that we have the problem of recycling. The head of the CSIRO, Larry Marshall, said in estimates it costs three times as much to recycle a battery as it costs for the metals that go into the battery. So I want to know how we're going to recycle all of this lithium, cobalt, aluminium, copper and all of the stuff that goes into these batteries. I don't think it's ever going to be economical to recycle these batteries, because it is so metal intensive. This is the big fallacy of all this. All you're doing is shifting from mining coal to mining rare-earth metals that are one or two per cent of the Earth's crust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Richard Herrington, the head of geology at the London Natural History Museum, said—he was just talking about Great Britain—there wasn't enough copper, nickel, neodymium and a few other metals in the Earth's crust to actually power the UK fleet. Where are we going to find all of these rare metals to basically have enough battery storage so that your renewables—I call them 'unreliables'. They're not renewable; the hardware isn't renewable, right? It's totally unsustainable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But look, these things, unfortunately—I've just realised that I'm never going to win this argument. Whenever I talk about this stuff I'm called a climate denier and told that I somehow don't care about the environment. I find that incredibly insulting. As someone who grew up on a farm, who yearns for the sound of the whipbird in the morning or the sound of the galahs out at Chinchilla and the beautiful noises they make—I love the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was offered a partnership in an accounting firm when I was 23. I turned it down to go overseas. The first place I went to was Africa. I climbed Kilimanjaro in the first week. I went to see the gorillas in the mist. I dived at Zanzibar. I went to the Serengeti. I went to Europe. I climbed the Alps; I rock-climbed in the Alps. I then went over to South America—the Machu Picchu trail. I went to Nepal. I've climbed the Aconcagua. I've surfed, skied, paddled down so many rivers. I love the environment, and yet whenever I raise these genuine concerns about the environment I'm castigated with intimidation, indoctrination and shoddy mathematical modelling showing that somehow the debate has moved on. Let me tell you the debate hasn't moved on, and it will never move on. At the end of the day, all science is underpinned by mathematics. And, if there isn't a mathematical algorithm that demonstrates cause and effect and quantifies that cause and effect, then that's not science, because behind every good scientist is a mathematician. If you go and watch these movies about these so-called science boffins, they're proving their algorithm on the wall.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And that's what I'm going to finish this speech on tonight, because I want to talk about the scientists. There is no greater scientist than Albert Einstein himself. Let me quote his conclusion from his 1917 paper 'The Quantum Theory of Radiation':</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">One feels justified in this because the momentum transferred by radiation is so small that it always drops out as compared to that from other dynamical processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does that mean? There are three forms of heat transfer: convection, conduction and radiation. At the end of the day, Albert Einstein, the great man himself, the greatest scientist that ever lived, said that radiation is so small that it is insignificant. Just remember that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to talk about science and the science of climate change, I say there's no such thing. It's the science of heat you need to focus on. The science of heat is called thermodynamics, and those rules were first settled 200 years ago by guys like James Joule, William Thomson—later on, 200 years ago, he became Lord Kelvin, the first scientist to be made a lord in the House of Lords—and Sadi Carnot, a great Frenchman who actually worked on the second law of thermodynamics. Technically speaking, it was the first law of thermodynamics, because he got to that before Boyle and Joule. But, anyway, I digress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch on these laws of thermodynamics to prove that this whole concept of adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere is somehow going to increase the heat. As anyone who understands science knows, E equals mc squared. Energy comes from the combustion of energy in the sun. Six hundred billion tonnes of hydrogen are burnt every second. That's converted into 596 billion tonnes of helium and four billion tonnes of energy. Radiation energy is carried by a boson known as a photon. Some of those photons came here to planet Earth, and they come in the form of about eight per cent ultraviolet energy, above the visible spectrum, about 42 per cent in the visible spectrum and about 44 per cent infrared energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Carbon dioxide, ironically enough, actually absorbs energy only at certain frequencies. One of those frequencies happens to be 2.8 microns, which is incoming radiation. Another frequency it absorbs at is 14.8 microns, which just happens to be outgoing long-wave radiation. Now, here's the thing: if you apply Planck's law, E equals hv, the energy consumed by carbon dioxide on the way in is actually five times stronger than the energy absorbed by carbon dioxide on the way out. They never want to tell you that. What do you think slows down the adiabatic lapse rate? If it wasn't for the greenhouse gases—we know this because the maximum temperature in Singapore is about 34 degrees. It has been proven that the H2O, the water vapour, actually cools. If you go to places in outback Queensland or Australia, you get 50 degrees in the summer. In Singapore, you won't get that, because the humidity actually stops the incoming solar radiation from getting too hot. It gets very muggy, but that's the water, not the radiation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So that's two laws. So far we've basically broken E equals mc squared, Einstein's 1905 special theory of relativity. He did four great papers that year. He didn't actually get a Nobel Prize for that. He got it for work that he did later that year on the photoelectric effect. And, of course, we've now also broken Planck's law. But then we go on to Wien's law. Wien's law calculates the temperature at which carbon dioxide will emit any energy it absorbs. We know that that's what's called—I did have to print this off; I can't remember this—the constant of proportionality, and that's 2.898 centimetres. If you put that over the wavelength that carbon dioxide absorbs, 14.8 microns, that will give you 192 degrees Kelvin. Now, 192 degrees Kelvin, for those of you who don't know your Kelvin scale, is minus 80 degrees Celsius in real life. In other words, carbon dioxide emits heat only at minus 80 degrees. So if you want carbon dioxide to supposedly trap heat, as you guys like to claim, you'll need to go either to the bottom of Antarctica or about 10 kilometres up into the troposphere to start getting carbon dioxide to emit heat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But here's the thing: carbon dioxide is only ever going to emit what comes in via radiation, via the photons, in the first place. But the problem with that—and that's if you use the first law of thermodynamics, which we'll now go to—is that energy is neither created nor destroyed, and this matters. This rule means that carbon dioxide absorbs energy only on a logarithmic scale, not a linear scale. So, according to the first law of thermodynamics, if I'm a one-tonne car and I'm travelling at 100 kilometres an hour and I hit another car, which is stationary and weighs one tonne, the most that that stationary car can move is 100 kilometres an hour. It can't go at 110 kilometres an hour. Likewise, with a photon that is absorbed by carbon dioxide, it only absorbs an existing photon. It doesn't increase the overall energy intake that's in the atmosphere. You cannot do that. But here's the thing, and I will accept that this little bit of the climate change theory is right: it will emit radiation in all directions, and some of that, albeit at negative 80 degrees, will radiate downwards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's where we use the second law of thermodynamics, which is that the entropy of a system will always increase. If I have half a glass of water here at 10 degrees and half a glass of water here at 20 degrees, and I tip one into the other, assuming we trap the heat, the water will end up at 15 degrees. Likewise, say we have a little bit of radiation come down—let's just say the lower part of the atmosphere. If one glass went to 9.9 degrees and the other went to 20.1, and you still tip them into each other, the entropy will always increase. It's still going to level out at 15 degrees. The point of the matter is that the very small amount of radiation emitted downwards, which is next to nothing—as Einstein said, it's so small it drops out—is going to be levelled out by the wind. And we know that. We all know that, because every day we see the wind constantly moving. That is the second law of thermodynamics in action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to have to finish my speech here, but can I just say I will vote against this bill because it is junk science. It has been based on false lies for far too long, and I will continue to fight this to the day I die.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FARUQI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:31</span>):  I rise to speak to the Climate Change Bill 2022 and a related bill, and I would like to associate myself with the fabulous comments that have already been made by my Greens colleagues. The Climate Change Bill, as first introduced by Labor, was a flimsy, purely symbolic bill designed to take an election promise and provide Labor with an opportunity for self-congratulations. The Greens have worked hard to improve it. We've ensured that the target can be ratcheted up over time. We've Dutton-proofed the bill with a genuine floor, which means that targets cannot go backwards. And we've ensured that government agencies such as Export Finance Australia, which in the past have funded coal and gas projects, will, for the first time, be forced to take climate targets into account when making decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is so much more to be done. The first and most obvious thing is that we have to stop making the problem worse while we're trying to solve it. Exacerbating the crisis that we are trying desperately to fix is a brazen act of self-sabotage. That's why it beggars belief that Labor have not ruled out backing new coal and gas projects. Right now there are 114 of these in the pipeline, and this includes projects like the Pilliga Narrabri coal seam gas project in my home state of New South Wales; the Woodside Scarborough gas field; and what will likely be the world's dirtiest gas project, Santos's Barossa in the Northern Territory, which will add billions of tonnes of carbon emissions over the coming decades. On top of that, the Albanese government is opening up nearly 47,000 square kilometres of ocean waters to oil and gas exploration. These will erase any climate gains made by the emissions reduction target many, many times over. In fact, Labor's target would be blown out by just one of these. As climate expert Ketan Joshi puts it, Labor is pouring a full tanker of petrol onto the fire while spraying it with a plastic water pistol at a distance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So weak targets like this one are really a bit of a fig leaf. The real fight—the fight the Greens are going to throw everything at—is to keep coal and gas in the ground. This includes introducing a climate trigger in environmental laws, having a strong safeguard mechanism and ending fossil fuel subsidies. We will push for massive investment in publicly owned renewable energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The harsh reality is this: we are in a climate emergency, we are facing an existential crisis, and the planet and people all over the world are suffering. As I speak, about one-third of my home country, Pakistan, is underwater because of monsoon rainfall estimated to have been 10 times as severe as usual. Melting glaciers are adding to these floods. One-third of Pakistan is an area roughly the size of the UK, from which 33 million people—more than the entire population of Australia—have been displaced. The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, described this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Pakistani people are facing a monsoon on steroids—the relentless impact of epochal levels of rain and flooding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He then called on the world to stop sleepwalking towards the destruction of our planet by climate change. In this country, we are sleepwalking. This is the climate emergency Labor is making worse every time it approves a new coal or gas project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, China is coming out of the longest and hottest heatwave it has ever recorded. For more than 70 days straight this year, nearly a billion people suffered through a heatwave that saw sustained daily temperatures above 40 degrees. This is the climate emergency Labor is making worse every time it opens up a new coal or gas project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Horn of Africa has seen the worst drought in 40 years, which has killed millions of livestock, destroyed crops and forced 1.1 million people from their homes in search of food and water. According to the UN's World Food Program, 22 million people are at risk of starvation. This is the climate emergency Labor is making worse every time it opens up a new coal or gas project. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there are also our neighbours—the Pacific island nations for whom the climate emergency is a daily lived reality and has been for some years. Some, such as the low-lying atoll nations of Kiribati and the Marshall Islands, are only six feet above sea level. Water is literally lapping at their doorsteps. Many of the Pacific island nations, which are amongst the lowest emitters on the planet, face intense cyclones, changing rainfall patterns, coral bleaching, ocean acidification and coastal inundation as a result of the climate crisis.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This crisis is global, and the decisions that we make here have global consequences. Right-wing commentators love to claim that Australia's contribution to global climate change is small in the grand scheme of things, but we emit far more than our fair share and we are one of the largest exporters of fossil fuels in the world. If we export our emissions overseas, that doesn't mean that they're not contributing to the climate crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also far more able than most countries to manage the costs of moving away from fossil fuels because of our wealth and bountiful access to sun, wind and water. Rich countries of the Global North, like Australia, bear the overwhelming responsibility for climate change. The climate crisis is essentially something rich countries are doing to poor countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens believe that global justice must be at the forefront of tackling the climate crisis. Human rights need to be at the forefront of tackling the climate crisis. Decolonising needs to be at the forefront of tackling the climate crisis. Indigenous sovereignty needs to be at the forefront of tackling the climate crisis, and that means listening to First Nations people who don't want the destruction of their land, their water, their air and their culture in Beetaloo, Scarborough, Pilliga, Narrabri or anywhere, for that matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After a decade of climate stupor by the Liberal and National governments, this bill does represent some progress. It is a small step in the right direction, but, after a decade of coalition ruin, Australia is in such a state of despair when it comes to the climate that even the smallest step is quite notable. But it's not near enough to the solution that we need. No government should be let off the hook on climate action. It's vital that the media, activists, NGOs and the community at large do not let the Labor government rest until we see real climate action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Without strong action, we are still hurtling towards climate disaster. Without urgent action, we are robbing the futures of young people all over the world. The planet is cooking and it is cooking fast. That's what's happening, so this is an emergency. We need a response that matches the scale of this crisis. We need urgent action. We need decisive action. We need strong action. We need an end to all new coal and gas. We need to stop killing the planet and its people. We need climate justice and we need it now.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  The Climate Change Bill 2022 and the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022 are the first bills the Albanese Labor government introduced into parliament. There's a reason for that. It helps us send a strong message that we acknowledge that climate change is a major threat and one that needs to be dealt with urgently. It's a threat to our prosperity, our safety, our national security and our way of life. The likelihood of it threatening the very survival of the human species is enough that we cannot afford to deny action. Even the climate change impacts we are seeing in Australia right now are disastrous enough to warrant urgent action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a dramatic increase in extreme weather events such as heatwaves, floods and wildfires, with the consequent loss of property, livelihoods and even lives. To give you a picture of the impact of climate change on Australia so far: since 2005, Australia has experienced nine out of 10 of its hottest days on record; in January and February 2009, a period which overlapped with the devastating Black Saturday bushfires, 374 excess deaths were recorded in Victoria due to heat related illness; in 2018, the fire season began in winter, while the 2019 bushfires created air pollution in areas such as New South Wales 11 times the hazardous level; the disastrous 2019-20 bushfire season caused around $80 billion of damage across Australia and burnt somewhere between three and four per cent of our land mass; and, this year, floods in Queensland and New South Wales have led to almost $5 billion in damage and killed 22 people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The world has warmed by 1.1 degrees since 1880. As it continues to warm, we will see a loss of biodiversity and an increase in extreme weather events. Not only do these extremes threaten people's safety and property, but we're also likely to see the increased spread of infectious diseases as changes in climate force the migration of species to new areas. Climate change has also exacerbated the severity of drought, putting pressure on agricultural production. Australia has always been a vast, rugged country subject to weather extremes, but what has been happening in the past two decades is something entirely different. This is not normal. Australians see these impacts and suffer from them, which is why increasing numbers of Australians keep calling for real action on climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, the time spent in office by the previous government was a wasted opportunity for climate change action. Every year that went by was a year of delay, denial and inaction. Among the Liberals and Nationals, we heard a variety of views on climate change while they were in government. They could not move forward, because they remained hopelessly divided on the issue. Among the ranks of the coalition were the outright deniers, ranging from those who refuse to believe changes in climate were influenced by human activity through to the even more bizarre view that the climate was not changing and government agencies were deliberately falsifying data. We saw those in the coalition who accepted the evidence that human activities were responsible for the extreme weather events offer an array of excuses for refusing to act. Some suggested that Australia should not be taking action to cut emissions until other countries make stronger commitments, despite Australia having the highest emissions in the world on a per capita basis. Others talked about the size of Australia's contribution to global emissions, but the question of Australia taking action is not just about our emissions; it's the example we set for the rest of the world, particularly the countries with the highest overall emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For years we've been seen as a pariah. We need to do our share of the heavy lifting if we're going to encourage others to do the same. Even when the previous government accepted that climate change was real, their actions failed to match their words. We saw policies advanced under the pretence of action. For example, the backbone of the coalition's policy for many years was the Emissions Reduction Fund, which wasted hundreds of millions of dollars on projects that did not deliver real cuts to emissions. Another great example is the so-called net zero by 2050 blueprint, which relied on a series of costly, unproven and underdeveloped technologies to do the bulk of the heavy lifting. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A policy that makes heavy cuts to Australia's emissions has to rely on the renewable energies that we know are cost-effective and work at scale, and they are wind and solar with backup battery storage. But those opposite have shown their contempt for renewable energy. They tried to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation under the guise of cutting red tape, even though the agency was making a profit. They also tried to abolish the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, and, when they failed at that, they tried to get ARENA to invest in fossil fuel and carbon capture and storage projects. And they even proposed underwriting coal-powered generation to the tune of billions of dollars. It's incredible that the previous government had such a pathological hatred of renewable energy that they opposed it, even when it made fiscal and economic sense without reference to emissions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation sets an interim target of a 43 per cent cut in emissions by 2030, and we know we can achieve a 43 per cent cut because it's the outcome predicted by the modelling of our climate change policies. Reaching this target will get Australia well on the way to our ultimate target, also enshrined in these bills, of net zero emissions by 2050. The 43 per cent target, mind you, is a floor and not a ceiling. We can be more ambitious if the circumstances call for it. In addition to these two emissions reduction targets, the bills now before the Senate will provide for an annual statement to parliament from the minister responsible for climate change. The statement will include an update on Australia's progress towards meeting our emissions targets. The bill will also restore the Climate Change Authority to provide independent expert advice to the minister on the annual statement and to provide advice on any new or updated emissions reduction targets to be communicated to the UN under the Paris Agreement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to have the opportunity to participate in a Senate inquiry into these bills and to hear from representatives of business, academia, environmental organisations, unions, think tanks, welfare groups—the list goes on. Overwhelmingly, those who contributed to the inquiry via written submissions and by addressing our public hearings were in favour of the objectives and provisions of the bill, with only a small minority opposed to them. These bills are just the foundation for our climate change action. We will get to work on our other plans, which include Rewiring the Nation, an enhanced safeguard mechanisms and Australia's first-ever electric vehicle strategy. Rewiring the Nation will get us to 82 per cent renewables by 2030 and will put downward pressure on power prices for Australian households. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's sad that against the weight of public opinion the opposition would oppose these bills. They remain stuck in the past on this issue, their heads firmly planted in the sand. After almost a decade of delay, denial and inaction, they've finally had an opportunity to end the climate change wars for the good of all Australians, but they've rejected it. Incredibly, they are even going against the wishes of the business community, who they purport to represent. But we are not deterred. We know that the overwhelming majority of Australians want climate change action. We will legislate these targets, and we will make a meaningful contribution to global action under the framework of the Paris Agreement, because Labor is getting on with the job. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:48</span>):  I rise to speak in relation to the two bills before the Senate this evening, the Climate Change Bill 2022 and the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022. In doing so I might address a few preliminary comments, if I could. First, in reference to Senator Faruqi's speech, can I just, with indulgence, give my sympathies and thoughts to the Pakistan diaspora in Australia who, no doubt, are suffering from seeing what is happening at the moment with respect to the devastating floods that are occurring in Pakistan. My thoughts and prayers are with you, as I'm sure are the thoughts and prayers of everyone in this place, and I do hope the Australian government can lift its game in terms of providing assistance to the people of Pakistan. I simply don't believe we've done enough in that regard. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point I'd like to make is in relation to gas, and it is one of the touchpoints in this debate. Whilst the Greens and Labor will both be supporting the legislation, there is a material difference between their positions with respect to gas in particular and the approval of future gas projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put a number of observations on the record with respect to the importance of gas for the foreseeable future. I note that, with respect to what is happening following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Germany at the moment is going as fast as it possibly can in constructing LNG terminals to allow them additional LNG imports. Just recently a company called EnBW Energy, a major German power producer, has entered into a 20-year contract, commencing in 2026—so, 2026 to 2046—to purchase an immense amount of LNG from the United States.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point I would make with respect to the importance of gas is that, if one looks at a company like POSCO in South Korea and its recent investment in a great Queensland company called Senex, again you can see that our near neighbours in North Asia are absolutely focused on securing their LNG supplies and are investing in Australian companies in order to secure those supplies on a long-term basis. I should say that POSCO at the same time is investing an immense amount of capital in relation to hydrogen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My third reflection in relation to gas is that Japan is again looking at increasing its LNG imports. It is also, I should note, reconsidering its position with respect to nuclear energy, given its energy constraints.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there you have a number of our major trading partners, all of whom recognise the issues relating to climate change, who are—each and every one of them—searching the world for LNG, in order to assist them to meet their energy requirements and deal with climate change issues. That should be recognised and it should be put on the record.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate is a house of review, Mr Deputy President McLachlan, and I know that you know that very well—indeed, you have experience in another place's upper house, which presumably has a similar perspective. I commend everyone who participated in the report of the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee that was prepared on this legislation. I've read it very carefully. There are 10 points I'd like to make in relation to the committee report, in relation to these bills which were considered by the coalition senators who served on that committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first is that there was insufficient consultation with respect to this legislation. In a situation where, by the government's own admission, this legislation is not necessary, it is absolutely gobsmacking that they haven't engaged in sufficient consultation with respect to this legislation. For example, the Australian Forest Products Association has raised concerns with respect to the legislation, as to the lack of consultation. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry was not consulted in relation to the legislation, which is just baffling. In addition to that, if one looks at paragraph 1.13 of the dissenting report of the coalition senators, one reads:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These concerns are bolstered by evidence from the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry admitting that they have done no modelling on the impacts of the Climate Change Bill 2022 and the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022 on rural and regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mean, that is just astounding—that the relevant departments, including the department of climate change, have done no modelling on the impact of this legislation on rural and regional Australia. How can that be?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this place I represent the great state of Queensland, as does my friend Senator James McGrath, who is in the chamber this evening. We represent the people of rural and regional Queensland, and we do so proudly. To see a situation where this government is putting forward legislation where the department of climate change hasn't done any modelling to consider the impact of this legislation on rural and regional Queensland is just unacceptable. It is unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point I'd like to make is that there has been no credible pathway thus far presented with respect to how the government is going to achieve its plan of firm—I emphasise that point: firm—82 per cent renewables by 2030. We simply don't have a credible plan with respect to how the government is going to achieve that goal. I don't think it's too much to ask that, just as the previous government did prepare a credible plan with respect to the goal of net zero by 2050, the government provide a convincing plan with respect to achieving their nominated goal of 82 per cent renewables by 2030.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, there's no assessment of the economic cost of higher power bills that will flow from this policy. Be honest with the Australian people. Be honest. Do the work. Tell us how much their electricity is going to cost. Do the work before you come to this place and introduce a bill such as this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth point is lawfare, something we're very, very familiar with in the state of Queensland, in relation to actions being taken by non-government organisations. The concern has been raised that there will be unintended consequences from this legislation in relation to NGOs—in particular, environmentally focused NGOs bringing legal action on the basis of this legislation to stop development on a piecemeal basis. An example of that in the overseas context is the action that was taken by an organisation called Plan B against the expansion of Heathrow Airport. That legal action went through a number of levels in the UK court system. In fact, they tried to refer the legal action to the European Court of Human Rights, I think, when they were unsuccessful before the United Kingdom Supreme Court. All of this causes cost, all of this causes delay, and it's done on a piecemeal basis, not on the basis of an overall, overarching strategy and plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I refer those who are listening to this debate to paragraph 1.27 of the coalition senators' dissenting report, where they state:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Environmental groups which provided evidence to the Committee refused to rule out using this legislation to challenge agriculture, primary producing, infrastructure, energy, resources, or forestry projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are the actual NGOs who would potentially use this legislation in order to engage in this lawfare. Notwithstanding the fact that the government says, 'There's nothing to see here; you don't have to worry about it,' the actual NGOs—who are the ones that society should be concerned about in terms of undertaking this piecemeal lawfare activity—are not ruling it out. In fact, when given the opportunity to rule it out, they specifically don't do so. When one of my colleagues raised that earlier this evening in the debate, a number of the Greens senators—I don't think the Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate was in the chamber at the time—actually applauded and clapped and said, 'Fantastic!' So we're concerned about those unintended consequences and what it means to major infrastructure projects and major development projects which are needed by this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fifth point I would like to raise is with respect to the change of the objectives and functions of a number of major Australian government agencies. I give you the example of Infrastructure Australia. Again, I refer to paragraphs 1.43 and 1.44 of the coalition senators' dissenting report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Coalition Senators are also gravely concerned that Infrastructure Australia could not explain the consequences of the Bills on their own decision making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They couldn't explain how the bill would impact their own decision-making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The agency could not explain how they would weigh the emissions of applicant projects versus the job creation opportunities … When asked repeatedly how this legislation would alter Infrastructure Australia's decision making, officials stated: 'We're still determining that' and 'We are receiving advice on it at the moment'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to this legislation coming to this place, perhaps that should have been determined. Perhaps we should have been in a position to understand in practice—moving away from the written word in the act to the practice of application—how Infrastructure Australia is going to practically implement the changes put forward in this legislation. We do not have the answer.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FAWCETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:06</span>):  I too rise to make some comments on the Climate Change Bill 2022 and the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022. It's important to note upfront, as some of my colleagues have, that the nationally determined contribution has already been advised by the government to the Paris Agreement secretariat on 22 June this year and that Labor, with the support of the Greens, will have the numbers to pass this legislation, so that itself is not in doubt. What I would like to do, though, is go to clause No. 3, which is the objects of the bill. The objects state the bill is to add to an effective global response informed by science.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those of you who read my first speech, and I trust that's all of you here, know that I have tertiary qualifications in science and that in my maiden speech I emphasised the fact that I'm a great believer in evidence based policy that is effective in addressing the problem at hand and that does not have unintended consequences. Also, having worked for much of my career as an experimental test pilot in the technical world of aerospace, which is underpinned by systems engineering, I recognise the need to scrutinise the basis and the assumptions of the science that underpin a design or, in this case, legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the bill's explanatory memorandum, this bill and the consequential amendments are informed by the consultation which led to Labor's Powering Australia plan. That consultation and the analysis of the plan's impact by the consulting firm RepuTex have been informed in large part by studies such as the <span style="font-style:italic;">GenCost</span> report, which was produced by the CSIRO and by AEMO, the Energy Market Operator. Reading <span style="font-style:italic;">GenCost</span> in detail, I note that they appropriately refer to stakeholders who are responsible for global best practice regarding the science and economics of energy, in particular reports by the International Energy Agency, the IEA; and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Nuclear Energy Agency, the OECD NEA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an example as to why scrutiny is useful, I'm concerned that while the <span style="font-style:italic;">GenCost</span> report reflects the major themes reported by the IEA and OECD, such as the need to move beyond the simple metric of the levelised cost of electricity when comparing technology options, some references used in the <span style="font-style:italic;">GenCost</span> report to underpin their cost assumptions are seriously outdated, as in we are talking back to the last century, when more recent information from these same independent expert bodies is available. I'm also concerned that some key observations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">GenCost</span> report questioning the ability of wind and solar to get us to net zero are omitted from the ALP plan and subsequent analysis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The question has to be: is the plan of the Albanese government based on the most recent and complete science available? Will it be effective in achieving its stated aims? What does the latest credible science say about the best way to provide abundant and cheap electricity while reducing emissions? In April this year the OECD NEA, which is quoted by <span style="font-style:italic;">GenCost</span> and recognised as a global expert, released its latest report on meeting climate change targets. It's an authoritative assessment of the key issues relating to energy policy and creating sustainable low-carbon economies. Much of the OECD report covers familiar ground regarding their view as to why global action is required urgently. There are major elements of the report, however, that challenge the Australian government's stated approach to reducing emissions, and at the heart of these elements are three statements. The first is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… decarbonising the electricity sector in a cost-effective manner while maintaining high levels of electricity security requires policymakers to recognise and equitably allocate system costs to the responsible technologies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… while all technologies impose some system costs, variable, intermittent, and uncertain sources of power generation impose far greater grid-level system costs, which is why it is so important to take a systems level perspective when comparing costs of variable renewables with nuclear, baseload hydro, and fossil generation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third statement from the OECD report is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All low-carbon technologies, including nuclear energy must be included in relevant discussions about the energy transition in order to maintain the integrity and evidence base of the policy dialogue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also considered the impact of emissions constraints for the different technologies. The Albanese Powering Australia plan looks to achieve 82 per cent market penetration of renewables by 2030. But figure 20 in the OECD report shows the breakdown of system costs as the share of variable renewables grows from 10 per cent to 75 per cent of the mix, including profile costs to compensate for variability and intermittency; connection, distribution and transmission costs; and balancing costs to compensate for uncertainty. It shows the effects on those total costs as carbon emissions are increasingly constrained. If that sounds complex, that's because it is. This is classic systems engineering. To quote the OECD's comment at the end of this analysis:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The policy implications of these systems costs findings are significant. It may be possible to reduce emissions to meet 2030 targets by growing the share of variable renewables in the mix. However, the costs of reaching net zero with high shares of variable renewables are likely prohibitive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That recent statement, by a stakeholder regarded by the CSIRO and AEMO to be a global expert on energy, is very different to the predominant political narrative. This OECD report changes the debate because it shows that the most recent credible science demonstrates that the approach proposed in the Albanese plan will not be effective in achieving the stated aim of the policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as the financial cost, the OECD report also considers other costs. First, it considers the environmental impacts of grid-scale generation options. For wind and solar as primary sources, it includes measures required for firming. The variation, for example, in the requirement for critical minerals is surprisingly large. There is a minimal impact on the order of nuclear power, with around 15 kilograms per megawatt hour. But that rises exponentially to 155 kilograms per megawatt hour for solar PV or 180 kilograms per megawatt hour for onshore wind. The report demonstrates that as the percentage of variable renewable generation and associated firming in a grid increases, the volume of mineral extraction and processing required becomes immense. This takes on a new relevance when the IEA also reports:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… looking further ahead in a scenario consistent with climate goals, expected supply from existing mines and projects under construction is estimated to meet only half of projected lithium and cobalt requirements and 80% of copper needs by 2030.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just a case of constraints in digging those critical medicals up; people often overlook the high energy demands required to produce the usable critical minerals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The OECD report also considers other costs, including land, environment and social impacts. As an example, the Albanese plan requires spending $20 billion to upgrade the electricity grid to connect more renewables. The capital cost is one consideration, but take, for example, the 10,000 kilometres of new transmission lines as recommended in AEMO's 2022 Integrated System Plan. Using data from Infrastructure Australia, you can obtain figures on the steel and concrete necessary for high-voltage transmission lines. Even being conservative and using the midpoint figures, they show that 46 tonnes of steel and 71 cubic metres of concrete are required for every kilometre of new transmission. That means that three-quarters of a million tonnes of iron ore have to be mined and then smelted, with all the associated energy and emissions, and, to make that much concrete, 180,000 tonnes of cement is required. Bear in mind that a single tonne of cement requires around 4.7 million Btu of energy, which is equivalent to about 180 kilograms of coal and generates nearly a tonne of CO2. So just meeting AEMO's 2022 plan will result in an additional 180,000 tonnes of emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The OECD report highlights that, for all these reasons, despite the rhetoric, renewable energy is not free, nor is it even the cheapest option available, nor is it effective in achieving net zero. The OECD report details that there is an affordable, safe technology to complement renewable power and which acts as an essential element to constraining emissions while retaining reliable, affordable power. The best science that's currently available, which is contained in the OECD NEA report, shows (1) that, despite ideological positions to the contrary, all credible models—for example, the 90 IPCC pathways to limit warming to 1.5 degrees—demonstrate that nuclear energy is required to effect climate change mitigation by 2050; (2) that the levelised cost per megawatt hour of electricity from long-term operation of nuclear generators is actually lower than fossil fuels, hydro, wind and solar, and that new-build nuclear is competitive with wind and solar now, and it will be cheaper when systems costs are attributed as emissions constraints are imposed; and (3) that recent developments prove that nuclear energy can be a low-carbon technology with rapid delivery times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Evidence to the 2019 inquiry by the House Standing Committee on the Environment and Energy showed that the integrity and evidence base of the policy dialogue in Australia have not been maintained, with AEMO and CSIRO detailing the impact of the legislative prohibition on even considering nuclear power. That prohibition is not related to science, safety, cost or efficacy. The prohibition resulted from trade-offs with minor parties in the Senate over 20 years ago and is predominantly given effect through section 10 of the Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998 and section 140A(b) of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That energy emissions policy has a significant effect on Australia's economic and national security, job security and quality of life, and the consequences of getting it wrong can almost be existential, as we see currently in Europe, which is suffering geostrategic paralysis and crippling growth in power costs because of poor energy policy. The prohibition in the EPBC Act must be repealed, to allow Australia to engage on the International Atomic Energy Agency milestone process to have an evidence based consideration as to whether the nuclear option is indeed the most reasonable path for Australia to pursue, in combination with wind, solar, hydrogen and other partial solutions to Australia's energy mix. It's important to recognise that nuclear is not a standalone solution, and in Europe it's currently working with solar and wind to load-follow and to provide firming for when renewables are not able to produce power. Any consideration of value must also recognise the other industrial uses for nuclear energy, such as the production of green hydrogen for desalination and for energy-intensive products such as fertiliser and cement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, the most recent science from recognised global experts refutes the assumptions underpinning the Albanese government's plan that increased investment in variable renewables will deliver abundant cheap power while reducing emissions to net zero. The science highlights that there is a solution. But the point is: we will never know what is possible and effective for Australia unless the prohibition on nuclear power generation is lifted. Australians should demand effective policy that is transparently based on all available evidence. This will only be possible if the government acts to repeal the outdated, ideologically driven barriers to evaluating the option of nuclear power generation. If Australia is serious about achieving net zero while still having affordable, reliable power, with minimal impact on our people and our land, our focus should be more on targeting legislation than on legislating targets.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:19</span>):  So we finally get a climate change bill—the Climate Change Bill 2022—into this parliament, and there's only one reason why. At the last election, the mood for change, for climate action and integrity, was electric, and I stand here today as part of a proud 16-strong Greens team delivered as part of that movement for change at the last election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In just the last two years, people have lived through the Black Summer bushfires, they've lived through repeated catastrophic floods and they're seeing the world suffering through the real impacts of the climate catastrophe in real time, all while we're at only 1.2 degrees or less of warming. Now, they are demanding action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For too long we have had governments who let corporations dictate the speed of climate action. We've lost decades with policy drift and fossil fuel greed, failing to take opportunities for innovation and be forward thinking and invest in a safe and livable future. Unfortunately, in an economic and political system based on endless growth and the myth of limitless extraction and consumption, this will not happen without far greater leadership than this bill shows. Instead of leadership, instead of the action needed to map out that safe future, we get this bill, Labor's compromise bill, which you'd give 43 per cent if you had to give it a mark out of 100. This bill is striking for its failure to deliver on even Labor's 45 per cent target that it took to the election in 2019, let alone the 75 per cent reduction by 2030 that all the science is telling us we need. This is part of a compromise that we've seen from Labor. They're trying to have it both ways: to be making sounds and noise on climate while really delivering for the fossil fuel donors and the corporate interests that ruled this place in the last parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is: you can't compromise on climate. You can't compromise on physics or cut a political deal with a law of nature. A bill that seeks to compromise on climate can't be anything but a very modest starting point, the very first slow step on a much longer path that we need to be running down. On that path must be the refusal of the 114 new coal and gas proposals currently in the pipeline, and a commitment—rock solid and in law—that we will keep all coal and gas in the ground. Without decisive action on that, this bill will utterly fail to deliver even its very modest goals. You can't put out the fire when you're pouring petrol on it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're debating this bill, as we've been watching this bill grind its way through parliament, the Independent Planning Commission in my home state of New South Wales has just approved an extension to the Mount Pleasant coalmine to extend its operations up until 2048, with a likely impact of something in the order of a billion tonnes of CO2. That mine will be pumping out coal and greenhouse gases for 18 years after this bill's 2030 target. You don't need to be a mathematician to recognise that pretending to take climate action by 2030 with this bill and simultaneously allowing the approval of a megamine to operate until 2048 are grossly inconsistent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the environment is being destroyed like this, the messages you hear come from activists, students and people who care about their future, their kids' future and their grandkids' future, but they also come powerfully from First Nations communities. I'd like to read the following words from a man I've worked with for many years: Scott Franks of the Plains Clans of the Wonnarua people. He sent this message this week about this appalling coalmine approval—just the one, but one of so many on Wonnarua lands, his family's lands, his lands, that he has been trying to protect. He said this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This mine has one of the largest concentrations of Aboriginal recorded sites on it in the Hunter Valley including a recorded mythological sight. The concentration of sites has not happened by chance but is the result of over 30 operational open cut coal mines in the Hunter Valley. Currently the coal mining operations in the Hunter Valley have had a significant impact on Wonnarua heritage and Wonnarua people have only 3% of our country left intact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Scott has told me on so many occasions about this mine and other mines, the conditions that we see in this week's IPC, Independent Planning Commission, approval, talking about monitoring and mitigating the impacts on Aboriginal lands and monitoring greenhouse emissions—they're all guff. The idea that any of that is a safeguard for land or water or culture or climate is plain preposterous. It's a joke, and we're calling it out for what it is. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, let's pass this bill with the improvements that have been negotiated through the hard work of climate activists. I particularly pay tribute to our colleague Adam Bandt, our Greens leader, for the hard work he and his team did in negotiating improvements: putting in a genuine floor, putting in greater transparency, making the bill better. But we acknowledge that this is nowhere near where this parliament needs to be on climate. Let's do it, because it shows we can at least take one step away from the climate vandalism of the former coalition government. Let's take some strength from that, but then let's get on with the real work that's needed, and that's the work to permanently keep coal and gas in the ground. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:26</span>):  Well, the Climate Change Bill 2022 is a mediocre piece of legislation. It's one that does not come close to reflecting what climate science is telling us, and it falls even further short of reflecting reality. It's the reality, the truth, of what is happening on our planet that I want to talk about tonight. And here is the reality, here is the truth: the planet's capacity to sustain human life is crumbling away. The ecosystem—that beautiful, complex web of life that sustains everything about this planet and makes our planet so much more than just a ball of rock orbiting a star—is crumbling away. We are losing the very essence of this planet, and it is happening because of what one species, human beings, have done and are doing. This collapse, this crumbling of our ecosystems and the planet's capacity to sustain life is being caused by a relatively small group of people. They are genuine psychopaths, the people that are doing this. They are relentlessly pursuing profit at the expense of the very lives of billions of people, let alone all of the other species who are suffering and, in so many cases, are facing extinction. Those psychopaths are the people running the big polluting corporations: the fossil fuel corporations, the logging and land-clearing corporations, those big emitting polluters who've got their blinkers on and are lining their filthy pockets with these rivers of gold at the expense of the very lives of some of the poorest, most vulnerable people on the planet. It's those people—the poor and the vulnerable, almost overwhelmingly the brown-skinned and black-skinned people on this planet—who are going to pay the price for the things that the overwhelmingly white male psychopaths have done and are doing. So that is the truth. That is the context in which we debate this bill today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make the point that this bill obviously, self-evidently, has not yet passed the parliament, and Labor has already started undermining it. Just this week we had the Prime Minister get up at a dinner hosted by the Minerals Council of Australia, the peak body of the big psychopathic emitters in this country, and assure them that they could basically keep on exporting fossil fuels indefinitely. I bet he got a good round of applause from the merchants of death in the Minerals Council. I bet he did. Do you know why they would be so happy? Because their ROI, their return on investment, for their political donations means that those donations are the best investment they ever made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just the CEOs of the big emitters who are psychopathic. There are psychopaths in this place, and I use that term advisedly. They are shills in this place: those who shill for the big corporate emitters. You know who you are. You are psychopaths, because you are putting your own political wellbeing, or at least what you perceive it to be, in the short term ahead of the very lives, potentially, of billions of people this century who are facing death—who are facing starvation or dying of thirst—or dislocation as a result of your greed and your self-interest. That is what is happening as we debate these bills. These big emitters, time and time again, make it clear that they want to continue opening new coal, new gas and new oil. They want to continue clear-felling our beautiful, precious carbon-rich native forests, despite those actions being contrary to every single piece of legitimate climate science that we know as humans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we get from a lot of the media in this place when they report on Labor's climate position is actually a prediction of what they wish the Labor Party was rather than an accurate reflection of what the Labor Party actually is, and that is a massive problem in our public conversation in this country—that so much of what happens is filtered through centrists and incrementalists in our press gallery. Why is that the case? Because far too many journalists are more interested in maintaining access to power than they are in reporting the truth. They will continue to peddle the lie that close enough is good enough when it comes to our climate, because if they call the Labor Party out for what this bill represents—mediocrity at best—they will get fewer contacts, fewer invitations, fewer texts out of the cabinet meetings or out of the Labor Party caucus, and fewer drops from Labor ministers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to be really clear about one thing about this bill and this debate. Contrary to what the Prime Minister would have us believe, this is by no means the end of the climate wars, because the climate war is not some cosy little dinner club conversation. The climate war is not some little political tizz in this place. The climate wars—and they will escalate into the future, mark my words—are being fought in our communities. They are being fought on the fossil fuel infrastructure. They are being fought in our native forests. They are being fought by people who are standing up. Strength to their collective arms, I say. They are standing up for our future and for the future of our children, to give our children and our grandchildren the chance and the kinds of opportunities in life that so many of us had and so many people in this place take for granted.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The climate wars are not some little chat between the backroom operators of the Labor Party and a handful of press gallery minions; they are actually and literally a fight for the future of humanity and for this planet's capacity to sustain life. That is what the climate wars are about. That is why it will continue to get more and more serious as time goes by. That is why I will be fighting until the day I draw my last breath on this planet. Do you know what? They can put me on the compost heap when I'm finished; I'll keep on fighting them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to pinch my nose and vote for these bills. But mark my words: the Greens are not going to settle for something that's simply better than nothing. We won't be settling for this. We will push Labor all the way. We will push them in relation to their blind addiction to fossil fuels. We will push them in relation to their blind addiction to logging native forests in this country. We'll do that because we are going to stand on the side of humanity; we're going to stand on the side of nature; and we're going to stand on the side of the environment. And we're going to stand against those psychopaths and big corporations who profit from destruction, and we will stand against the political parties they have in their collective pockets.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the centralists, the centrists and the incrementalists who exist not just in the press gallery but, unfortunately, in some environment and climate groups in this country as well I say this: imagine if over the last few years you'd spent as much time cheering on the Greens as you did cheering on the Labor Party. Imagine over the last few years if you had spent as much time urging the Labor Party to increase its climate ambition as you'd spent urging the Greens to decrease our climate ambition. Just imagine how much better this legislation would be if you had taken those actions over the last few years instead of crab-walking into the centre and urging incrementalism on the body politic in this country. Just imagine the kind of future you could have actually worked to achieve for your children and your grandchildren. Imagine the better life and the better world you could have helped build, and imagine the better legislation you could have helped craft if you'd taken those actions. But, instead, you let mediocrity be the enemy of the good. I say to you all: do better next time.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:38</span>):  So it has come to this. The globalists' 50-year long march through the institutions has come to this. Fifty years of bribery, coercion and censorship of the few remaining honest scientists has come to this. Fifty years of inciting hatred and violence against anyone who opposes the climate change agenda—of fear based control—has come to this. Our scientists, crony corporations, political parties and mouthpiece media have failed Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I always speak up for what is right. Again today I will speak up for what is right. The Climate Change Bill 2022 seeks to exploit fear based on fraudulent science to enshrine in legislation the subjugation of everyday Australians. On many occasions now, I have sought to alert Australians to the nightmare our lives will become under net zero. Those many speeches, motions and bills have made little headway in mainstream media where dodgy journalists protect the interests of their advertisers and billionaire owners and ignore the truth. The public have been deceived into thinking that human activity is what is causing natural events and that this bill is necessary to save Australia. Instead, the truth is that Australia will need to be saved from this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not conjecture. There's ample evidence to support this position from overseas experience of the nightmare that results from acting on fake science and feelings instead of hard, costed data. Here's a quick summary. Firstly: greening the world and growing food. According to the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, one-quarter of the increase in carbon dioxide in the last 30 years has been absorbed into plant life, leading to an increase in forest cover. This demonstrates the fertiliser effect of carbon dioxide, or, as it's known, CO2. Although climate catastrophists think we can control the level of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere, Henry's law of chemistry, nature and empirical scientific evidence show that we cannot and we do not. Let's assume, though—contrary to the science and nature—that we can. If it was possible for humans to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, it would reduce the health of native forests and vegetation. Reducing CO2 would reduce crop yields, remove food from the tables of the world's hungry and require the increased use of chemical fertilisers that are made from natural gas—an irony lost on this bill's proponents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The world is finding out, as Sri Lanka has found, that the trade-off here is between plant food and starvation. It's that simple. Forestation levels around the world have been rising since the 1980s because of the increase in CO2. Australia is currently gaining forest. Let me be clear for the benefit of the disinformation media: our continent is gaining trees, meaning the density of vegetation is improving, thanks to carbon dioxide. We're losing extent, though—much of it chopped down as part of so-called green energy construction such as building wind turbines, solar plants, access roads and transmission easements to take unreliable energy from where these things are built to where the power is needed. Thirteen thousand hectares of native vegetation is planned for destruction in North Queensland alone. I remember when greenies hugged trees instead of chopping them down. Forests are being chopped down for biomass—woodchips! Can you believe it? Apparently woodchips are now renewable energy—oh, really!—spruiked on the BBC back in 2018 when the Drax coal plant was converted to burn trees imported from America in the name of reducing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Burning trees produces more carbon dioxide than burning coal, yet 'warmers' never let the facts get in the way of their feelings. One Nation has always supported preserving our old-growth forest because One Nation supports real environmentalism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at ocean health. According to NASA, one-half of the increase in carbon dioxide over the last 30 years has been absorbed in the ocean carbon dioxide cycle. CO2 is sequestered in silt and in biological sinks. Seagrass, mangroves, tidal swamps and wetlands all sequester carbon dioxide and grow, improving habitat for fish breeding. CO2 is a vital ingredient in phytoplankton, the start of the marine food chain—and we are at the top of that chain. The more carbon dioxide produced from all sources and then absorbed in the ocean carbon dioxide cycle, the more phytoplankton there are, leading to an increase in marine life. Healthier seafood density supports the continued harvesting of seafood as an affordable source of protein for people. The marine carbon dioxide cycle absorbs nitrogen and phosphates coming from natural and man-made sources. Phytoplankton absorb these elements as part of their growth cycle, producing oxygen in the process. The less carbon dioxide available to be absorbed the less oxygenation and the less healthy our oceans become. These are simple facts. If you understand nature and conservation, you'll understand this. Coral is calcium carbonate—'carbon-ate'—CaCO3. Some of the CO2 sequestered in oceans has helped coral growth, most likely contributing to the record coral cover across the Great Barrier Reef announced just a few weeks ago—another inconvenient truth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the third point: greening the earth mitigates temperatures. A new study reported on NASA's website shows increased vegetation during the current 'greening earth period', as NASA calls it, and that has a strong cooling effect on the land due to increased efficiency of water vapour transfer to the atmosphere. Without this, the world would be hotter; instead it is slightly cooler. Increasing carbon dioxide—plant food—fertilises our forests, increasing transpiration and leading to more water vapour transfer, which, in turn, cools the earth. Earth's history shows periods of increased temperature cause increased evaporation from oceans, and that water vapour transfer further cools the Earth. We have a beautiful, self-correcting ecosystem that has maintained the Earth at a liveable temperature range for millennia—fact! This Climate Change Bill is based on self-interest, arrogance, hubris and deceit, risking a natural ecosystem that will protect us from any variability in atmospheric gases and that always has protected us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Next, renewable power is a fairytale. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could get all our energy from the sun and wind for free? Oh, yes, that is the extent of the thought processes of many Greens and teal voters. But they're missing the obvious problem. Solar panels, wind turbines, transmission lines through the middle of nowhere, battery backups and access roads are not free. The direct loss of natural habitat from wind and solar is significantly greater than from any other form of power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Four megawatts of wind or solar generation is needed to replace each megawatt of coal, hydro and nuclear. To explain with an example, the New South Wales government's own website on wind power mentions their 850 megawatts of wind turbine capacity generating just—wait for it—1,941 gigawatt hours of power annually. With a coal or nuclear plant of that size, their 850 megawatts running 24/7 would generate 7,440 gigawatt hours per year. The actual wind turbine output of 1,941 gigawatt hours represents just 26 per cent of rated capacity for the wind turbine. What a joke these things are—and solar is far worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at battery backup. The Australian Energy Market Operator, AEMO, recently assessed the battery requirement for a net zero grid stability at 60 gigawatt hours. Power going into a battery loses 20 per cent in resistance, meaning 72 gigawatt hours of generation will be needed to produce just 60 gigawatt hours of output. Batteries cost $1.5 million per megawatt hour, meaning batteries for short-term grid stability will require an investment in excess of $100 billion every 10 years, which is as long as these bloody things last. This is just the start! Germany experienced an eight per cent reduction in output from wind and solar in the first half of 2021, owing to poor weather. No battery can keep the lights on during a sustained period of wet weather such as Australia has had these past two years. Blackouts will be normal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those who want net zero by 2050, nuclear is the only way to do it. Other countries who descended into renewable hell ahead of us are being forced to rethink to save their economies. South Korea has given up; it's announced a move away from wind and solar to nuclear. Germany will extend its last three nuclear power plants until base-load power can be restored from gas that produces carbon dioxide. Last week the UK government announced a huge new 3,200-megawatt nuclear plant. Nuclear plants across the world will grow 26 per cent through to 2050. Australia can supply the world with reliable, safe coal for many lifetimes. Instead the world is going nuclear simply because wind and solar power supply reliable base-load power and coal has been demonised. If this Climate Change Bill passes, Australia will be forced to make this decision for nuclear power. Those who vote for this Climate Change Bill, you are voting for nuclear power!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the insane power bills that will destroy the Australia we know. Last week in Britain, the household energy cap increased from $21.60 to $60.20. It's tripled in just one year—and you're doing this! How can people afford that? We cannot. Commercial power has risen 600 per cent in one year. Widespread business closures are now likely. A glance at the graph of UK GDP shows that UK citizens are less wealthy now than back in 2007. The correlation of GDP stagnation with the retirement of affordable base-load power and the switch to wind and solar is undeniable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">German households are so desperate for heating, firewood is now being hoarded and woodchips are back in commercial use. Seriously, what's next? Is whale oil going to make a comeback? Despite $250 billion spent on solar and wind so far, and $250 billion still to come, Germany is planning for blackouts next winter. Ten per cent of German industry is threatened with closure and 40 per cent is under financial pressure. No wonder Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is holding a jobs summit concurrent with the Climate Change Bill. Here's One Nation's submission to the jobs summit: stop destroying affordable, reliable coal power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The mouthpiece media are blaming the war in Ukraine for the gas shortage in Europe, deliberately avoiding the real question: how did energy-independent nations lose their energy independence and become reliant on Russian gas? Wind and solar did that. Is this empirical proof that wind and solar are unable to sustain base-load power, or is it just stupidity in shutting down base-load power before replacements were built? The answer is both. With unrealistic and unnecessary time lines now embedded in the Climate Change Bill, Australia is about to walk the same path which has brought the rest of the world, especially the UK, Germany and Texas, only misery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at costs. Wind and solar are only cost effective to build and operate if the cost is offset with taxpayer subsidies. Australian subsidies for wind and solar currently total $13 billion every year. Reuters reported last week that Australia will need about 40 times the total generation capacity of today's National Electricity Market to achieve net zero. This includes 1,900 gigawatts of solar and 174 gigawatts of wind—not megawatts, gigawatts. How is that even possible? It's not. As a comparison, Liddell coal plant is two gigawatts and at full capacity can supply five per cent of our current energy needs. Charging electric vehicles is a large part of this huge increase in power generation needed to reach net zero. The $20 billion cost of rewiring and upgrading the national energy grid to allow for the charging of electric cars dwarfs the total value of the National Electricity Market, which is only $11 billion in sales. What will that do to power prices? There is no costing in the Climate Change Bill because the costings are coming out at insane amounts of money. I have a second reading amendment to this bill to introduce a cost-benefit analysis for every government decision. Surely that is just prudent economic management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On blackouts, last week AEMO announced its latest 10-year outlook for the National Electricity Market, which warned of reliability gaps affecting New South Wales from 2025 and affecting Victoria, Queensland and South Australia from 2030. 'Gaps' in this context means structural blackouts—not enough generation to meet demand. Today we know there will be blackouts in 2025 and even worse blackouts in 2030. What is the government's plan to stop the blackouts we know are coming due to coal plant closures? There's no plan, because the Climate Change Bill is not about increasing energy output; its aim is forcing a reduction in energy consumption. They want us to use less energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Climate Change Bill is about control. The only way to achieve any partial or long-term stability under net zero is to use smart meters to restrict energy use. Germany and America have already started that rollout. The South Australian government has announced the rollout of smart meters. Smart meters allow the energy operator or government to go in and turn off any appliance in your home that is connected to the fuse box—air conditioners, the hot water service, lights and power circuits can be switched off remotely. This is not intended as an emergency measure. It will be normal under net zero. Big Brother will reach into your home and decide for you what appliances you can use and when. In what used to be a free country, this is terrifying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the Greens and teal supporters who voted on the basis of feelings, not facts, I say you have been deceived. The experience of countries ahead of us on the net zero slippery slope has seen the destruction of small and medium business, the decimation of the middle class and intrusive government control. You will have less, and elite billionaires will have more. We are paying for our own enslavement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time to vote against creating a world where native vegetation, crop yields, the marine environment and the entire biosphere, the beautiful biosphere, is being damaged through an absurd attempt to reduce carbon dioxide. Nature's essential trace gas is essential for all life on the planet. It's time to vote against a world where hunger and poverty will increase by design as a means of control. Have some decency. Vote against the Climate Change Bill 2022. Take a stand. We have one flag, we are one community, we are one nation. We are proud and grateful carbon based life forms.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="207825" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:53</span>):  Tonight I rise to contribute to the debate on the Climate Change Bill 2022 and Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022. The Climate Change Bill legislates the Albanese Labor government's nationally determined contribution change under the Paris Agreement of 43 per cent emissions reduction by 2030. In their words—I've been listening to the debate today—this bill is either unnecessary, if you listen to some, or, as the Greens say, it's largely symbolic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to be clear, this isn't a debate today in this chamber about the science of climate change. It's actually a debate about the bill before us, which is to legislate that target. The Albanese government won the last election and have already changed our nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement, as they were able to do as the government of the day. They've made some changes to that document that we took to Glasgow last year, and I also am foreshadowing amendments to insert back some of the mechanisms that we as a coalition government put in. The debate is actually about the concern that legislating the target will bring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From my perspective as a proud National Party senator and a regional Australian, this bill fails to take into account the impact that legislating the target will have on regional Australia. It fails to appreciate that there are some Australians, some industries, which will be disproportionately impacted by this compared to others. One of the great myths and, I believe, one of the great follies of the public debate over recent years has been that somehow a move towards net zero by 2050 will be painless; it will be sweetness and light; no-one will have a change to their job or an impact on their earnings; and there will be no negative impacts—that, in the words of Helen Haines, it's only going to be upsides and benefits for rural and regional Australia. The fact is that, when we held the committee inquiry into this bill, fast and furious as it was, it wasn't just the National Party saying that rural and regional communities and industries were going to be disproportionately negatively impacted by this; it was the trade unions, one after another, acknowledging that workers in traditional industries like mining, agriculture and manufacturing would be significantly impacted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also heard that increased lawfare by vexatious green activists—such as we've seen overseas when they've legislated targets—was going to occur. In the UK, when Friends of the Earth took action against the Secretary of State for Transport over the Heathrow Airport third runway, it held up that project for an incredibly long time. In Germany we've seen this level of lawfare because they've legislated. This is what has happened in a raft of countries, as is outlined in the coalition's dissenting report. That is concerning, particularly as this level of public infrastructure is so essential for us to increase productivity, prosperity, security and safety for our citizens and our nation going forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Concerningly, during the Senate inquiry, when we asked environmental activist group after environmental activist group about this—'You're all in favour of legislating this target and putting it into law, and you want greater action on climate change, and you're signing up, so does that mean, then, that you will refuse to take the Albanese federal government or any future federal government of Australia to court using this legislated target?'—one after another they all refused to guarantee that they would not weaponise what we're doing here tonight: legislating a target which we've already agreed to as a country through our nationally determined contribution—I assume the government has a plan for us to get there; I haven't seen that yet—and which they have said is both unnecessary and symbolic. We're actually opening up that sovereign risk for their own government and future governments, thanks to green activists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also heard about the significant impact on regional jobs and industries. Unions, industries and researchers didn't take a backward step when asked the question. Absolutely, rural and regional communities are going to be impacted. Absolutely, agriculture, mining and manufacturing are going to be the areas of our economy that will be impacted. There were a variety of ways that these different stakeholders sought to address that impact. I'll leave that for another day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third issue that was raised was a lack of transparency, accountability and measurement of what that impact would be; lack of a road map underpinning the target; and lack of understanding of who was going to be negatively impacted. As the shadow minister for infrastructure, transport and regional development, I am incredibly concerned that the bill puts this overlay on 14 federal agencies to assess any given project on a methodology that is yet to be made public and understood. When we questioned these agencies, they had no idea how they were going to do this and what impact it would have. That raises justifiable questions: are public transport projects in major capital cities going to be prioritised over dams in Central Queensland, prioritised for federal public funding over roads like the Outback Way or the Inland Rail? Probably, but they couldn't tell me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things this chamber is supposed to do is actually hold the government and the executive to account, but you can't do that if they don't know what they're doing, and it was very clear to all those agencies from the north Australia authority, Infrastructure Australia and others that the methodology hadn't been determined, and they couldn't answer basic questions about how legislating this target and making their assessment decisions subject to it were going to impact the decision and which communities in this country are going to benefit from federal government decisions into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to regional jobs, throughout this debate industry bodies like the Business Council of Australia said we're going to get 195,000 new economy jobs to 2070, while other research providers like the IPA say 653,600 jobs are at risk in the regions. That's actually a negative shortfall of over 458,000 jobs. I want to see net zero impact on regional jobs and I want that guaranteed. One mechanism to future-proof regional jobs in a future Paris pledge would be to insert caveats to protect the regions, to make transparent what the impact of these pathways to net zero are on particular people, particular industries and particular places. That's why, when our government updated the nationally determined contribution last year in Glasgow, we inserted the need for an independent socio-economic impact assessment for rural and regional Australia, something the Albanese government removed when they took power. They upped the target and took out the caveats of protection. They took out the caveats of accountability for future pathways to net zero. They took away the transparency that would ensure that future governments take heed not only of the benefits that will supposedly come with this trajectory but also, to quote the mining council mayors, of the 'disbenefits'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These mayors were very, very concerned that MPs were only talking about the benefits. Indeed, amendments moved in the other place sought to assess and measure only the benefits that this trajectory would bring for rural and regional Australia. Let's be honest about this: you can't just say we accept the science of climate change and then not accept the reality that some people are going to be more impacted than others. They haven't been consulted, these mining mayors. The Labor Party has not gone to these labour towns and actually had the conversation with them around the impact of legislating this target.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only the National Party has entered the debate on carbon emissions concerned not with the electoral impact but with the actual impact. One benefit of belonging to a century-old party is that we've been around long enough to understand the impacts of the decisions of previous generations in this place. We've seen it, and the brutal truth is that the path of net zero by 2050 will have losers and winners. That's why last year we were able to secure, as a first tranche of investment, for our communities on that path, in excess of $20 billion of addition new funding into rural and regional economies to build that critical nation-building, future focused infrastructure, to diversify cities like Gladstone and places like the Hunter. We inserted that caveat around assessing the impact—the benefits and the disbenefits—for future governments to build on that $20 billion over the next 15 years. If you look at Europe, whence everybody likes to take their lead on action on climate change, they have over this time, significantly, put hundreds of billions of euros into their regional communities not only to help those communities take advantage of the opportunities but also to overcome many of the challenges that are coming with this pathway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we hear precious little debate about the impact of this legislation on actual people. There are a lot of self-congratulatory speeches and there's barely a reference to the reality that world carbon emissions will continue to grow, even as we do the right thing in this country and continue on a downward trajectory with our emissions profile. As I foreshadowed, we will be moving an amendment to the bill to establish a five-yearly assessment of socioeconomic impact by the Productivity Commission. That evidence is to be tabled in parliament every five years prior to future governments resetting that Nationally Determined Contribution target so that they can do it with eyes wide open of who's paying the price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to know why this is important, just check out Europe. It has led the way on global efforts to decarbonise its economy. Its member countries have also been confronted with and subsequently been forced to deal with unexpected and unforeseen geopolitical, economic and, indeed, climate realities that have resulted in member countries pausing their ambitions for the benefit of their citizens. Individual EU member countries have recognised that protecting their own citizens must come first to ensure adequate supply of the basics: heating, and reliable and affordable baseload power to sustain their national industries. Others, through the course of this debate, have highlighted what European countries—everyone from the UK to Germany—are doing in the face of unforeseen circumstances, and we must be prepared to do the same. We cannot be naive to the fact that we live where we live, nor, in particular, to some of those geostrategic considerations that may be coming our way in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our priorities have to include not only protecting our natural environment but also ensuring that regional jobs, regional communities and regional industries benefit from everything a government does. We heard evidence in the inquiry that the legislation will have significant economic and social consequences, including that all 89 coal, gas and oil projects currently in the construction pipeline must be cancelled. This is a direct quote from a submission: 'This will come at a cost of at least $274 billion across Australia, equivalent to 14 per cent of our annual GDP—480,000 jobs.' It's not ideology. It's not emotion. They're just the facts that we're all going to have to deal with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll let others talk about the benefits of nuclear. It was great to see the AWU out in force, supporting a zero emissions baseload fuel source to keep their workers in high-paid manufacturing jobs into the future and ensure we can also do our bit to take down global emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I didn't enter politics to help rich people get richer. I actually came into politics to help the marginalised, the vulnerable and the voiceless, and a lot of them are out where I live in rural and regional Australia. They are the people who provide the common wealth that we too often take for granted in this place: the truck drivers, the miners, the foresters and the farmers. As a proud National I will continue to stand by them, I will continue to stand up for them and I will continue to hold this government to account on their behalf.</span>

Let's not have a lend of ourselves: this legislation does not lower emissions by one milligram.

How do I face people I went to school with who work in the industry and tell them I didn't do enough to protect their jobs, their homes and their families? None of them want to hurt the planet. They don't want to jump in the Ranger and go off to work with dreams of melting glaciers. They just want to put a meal on the table and a roof over their heads. How do I tell Scott that, if he manages to get a job paying $70,000 less, I didn't stand up for him? We must not fall into the same trap as Europe. We must learn from their mistakes in the past and we must ensure we support those who will be impacted the hardest.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nationals believe in practical action to address the impacts of climate change and a 'no person and no place left behind' approach to the transition. It appears that all parties of government believe we need to reach net zero, and I think they do believe it can be achieved. But I also believe targets based solely on ideology without any real plan will not achieve a fair outcome for communities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am one of the few in this place that went to COP last year. I toured regions in the north of England and parts of Scotland that have been crippled by sudden and severe reduction and elimination of steel mining and manufacturing. The advice that was most common when I was asking the question about a way to look for a transition was, 'We can show you how not to do it.' The Nationals believe that decarbonising the economy needs to be fair and just.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I sat on the inquiry for this legislation. I also listened to the evidence presented to us of the intended and unintended consequences that these bills would yield. The committee was presented with evidence that a typical worker in regional Australia is over three times more likely to have their job put at risk by the policy of net-zero emissions by 2050 than a typical worker in the inner city. This is because workers in regional areas are far more likely to work in industries such as coalmining, heavy industry and agriculture. We received submissions, as my leader before me said, that showed that, to achieve the government's target, all 89 coal, gas and oil projects in the construction pipeline must be cancelled. This will come at the cost of the approximately 480,000 jobs which would otherwise have been created.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The UN has stated a global transition towards a low-carbon and sustainable economy will have both positive and negative impacts on employment. Policymakers must smooth the edges of this transformation by developing just transition policies for affected workers and their communities. In 2021, the European Union announced the European Green Deal, a package of more than 500 billion euros providing tangible investments to deliver sustainable social outcomes as member states transition their economies. Neither these bills nor the government to date have acknowledged the same principles outlined by the EU or the UN. The committee was not furnished with any evidence either by submission or by testimony that the government has any intention of a similar package being developed or considered.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite also want all the corporate climate change strategies of Europe but want to supply none of the safety measures for regional communities that were put in place. Regional Australia, under the Greens-Labor policy, is to get all of the pain and none of the gain. The Australian government cannot guarantee through faith alone that the promise of carbon-neutral jobs from new industries, energy projects and technology will be in the same communities as those predicted job losses.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nationals consider that legislating a 43 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 without a complementary package of financial support for affected communities and carbon-intensive industries, particularly in rural and regional Australia, presents a clear and present danger to the welfare of our communities. The Nationals believe that a guaranteed investment package based on the United Nations principles, to develop leveraging opportunities generated from the global focus on technology advancements to decarbonise economies, is required. If managed properly and administered sensibly, such investments have the potential to grow the Australian economy and create new work opportunities in the regions whilst transitioning those impacted workforces and local economies.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nationals believe there is widespread community and industry support to establish a regional transition authority, or several, to address specific regional communities and outcomes. We need to get the boots on the ground. The inquiry heard it has specific support from the likes of the Business Council of Australia, the Grattan Institute and the Blueprint Institute to do this.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last two decades we have been told we must listen to experts in transitions to net zero. Listening to the experts over two days of hearings, we heard Mr Tennant Reed say:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">To achieve the net zero transition, we are going to need to build a lot of big things and many distributed small things around the country: major new mines for lithium, for rare earths and for a range of other inputs …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can we afford to delay the mining approvals for these things if we are to transition but no plan is in place? Ms Constable said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">By 2030, globally, we need to increase lithium production fourfold, double rare earth element output, deliver a 67 per cent increase in nickel and produce 32 per cent more copper.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our new net zero economy relies upon increased rooftop and farm solar products and electric vehicles, and all of these elements require rare earth minerals sooner rather than later. However, Ms Constable said, the problem is:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In terms of what is being suggested, we will need a lot more copper investment to occur, and nickel and cobalt to occur.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I don't think we're on the right trajectory with things like copper; we're not exploring enough and not finding enough of the new mines of the future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we aren't doing enough to build the things to get there, we are in trouble. Without these resources, building the connectivity required for Labor's 82 per cent target for renewables is not going to happen. If we are to transition to net zero, we need to increase mining of rare minerals. This will also assist in growing our economy and offsetting potential job losses. Where is the plan for this? Where is the support for this? There is none.</span>

We will be told we have to honour the percentage of science that affirms the views of those opposite whilst ignoring the science that they don't agree with.

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New</span><span class="HPS-Electorate"> South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:18</span>):  Thank you, Deputy President. The passage of this bill, the Climate Change Bill 2022, and a related bill would be a landmark day for climate action in Australia. The government is proud of this legislation. It's a demonstration of our commitment to ambitious action on climate change, to transparency and to accountability on this defining issue of our time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are entering a new phase. We move on from discussing whether we will join the global transition and instead discuss how. We are working with workers, businesses, farmers and climate advocates. We can and we must take strong climate action and start taking the real and necessary steps to create a low-carbon future, and that is what this bill does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills provide the clearest signal this parliament can provide that Australia is serious about climate action, serious about building a net zero economy and serious about capturing the jobs, the investment and the other benefits that a net zero economy will bring. These bills demonstrate that we are serious when we say that we care about future generations and the effects of climate change on the world they will inherit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Climate Change Bill legislates Australia's emissions reduction targets to be achieved by 2030 and by 2050. It makes clear that these targets are a floor, not a ceiling, on our ambition. The bill enhances accountability and transparency through an annual statement to parliament, reporting on Australia's progress towards the targets informed by independent expert advice from the Climate Change Authority. It provides for independent advice from the authority on future targets. The consequential amendments embed consideration of the targets into the objects and functions of a range of Commonwealth entities and schemes, focusing effort and ensuring that they are all pulling in the same direction. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills have been developed and added to following collaborative, good-faith discussions with other members of parliament. In July the government invited the Australian parliament to end the climate wars that have stymied and delayed action for so many years, and many across the parliament accepted that invitation. The government consulted with interested members of parliament in good faith. We have agreed to reasonable amendments that strengthen the bills, are consistent with the government's election mandate and will facilitate the passage of these important reforms. The government thanks those members and senators for their engagement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also thanks the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee for its comprehensive report on the bills. Naturally, we agree with the committee's recommendation that the Climate Change Bill and the consequential amendments bill be passed. The committee also recommended that, after the bills are passed, the government undertake further consultation on possible legislative amendments and policy responses, including reviewing the use of native forest wood waste for renewable energy and the transition arrangements for Australian workers affected by decarbonisation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On Tuesday Minister Bowen announced the government will release a consultation paper on the native forest wood waste issue, inviting stakeholder views on the changes recommended by Senator David Pocock and the Greens party. The concerns raised relate to a decision by the Abbott government in 2015 to put native forest wood waste back into the scheme. The government will consider next steps in light of the results of that consultation and look to make any necessary changes to the regulations by the end of the year. We understand that the issue raised relates to eligibility under the Renewable Energy Target. It is not a reflection on the government's general support for sustainable native forest industries and the workers that depend on those industries. Minister Bowen had previously committed to exploring further amendments to primary and subordinate legislation to embed the targets and the Paris Agreement into a wider set of relevant legislations and schemes. We will undertake that review and consult with stakeholders, implement further actions and report back to parliament in the second annual statement. We will welcome suggestions for further amendments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking beyond the bills to the broader implications of the net zero transition for Australian workers, I note that the Greens, in their dissenting report, recommended that a statutory authority be established. Climate action brings enormous job opportunities, but it also brings challenges. At last week's Jobs and Skills Summit the government committed to a coordinated approach with industry, unions, local governments and communities to assist affected workers and regional communities prosper in a clean energy future. We will continue to work with states, territories, unions, industries and communities to deliver a framework for net zero economic development in our regions, including through the National Energy Transformation Partnership agreed by energy ministers last month. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Prime Minister has said on numerous occasions, this is a government that will make sure that no-one is held back and no-one is left behind. That includes the workers who build, maintain and operate our energy system and who are so crucial for its transformation. Decarbonisation of the global energy system and the broader economy presents immense opportunities for Australia's regions and reduces the serious threats to rural and regional areas that arise from unchecked climate change. This government is committed to harnessing these opportunities and to a brighter, more hopeful and more prosperous future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens also recommended, in their dissenting report, that a climate trigger should be placed on all projects in development so that the Minister for the Environment and Water can assess projects against the government's emissions targets. The government will formally respond to the Samuel review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to help strengthen Australia's environmental protection law. The government has committed to introducing legislation in 2023, following extensive consideration and consultation. We're currently consulting on changes to the safeguard mechanism to cover existing and new facilities with over 100,000 tonnes of direct emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also thank Senator Andrew Bragg for his engagement with the Senate inquiry into the bills. I'm pleased to say that the government agrees with him that the market should be supported to invest in low- and zero-emissions energy and the transmission infrastructure required to decarbonise. Our Powering Australia and Rewiring the Nation policies are providing that support. We note Senator Bragg's recommendation that the Australian government should support the supply of gas as a transition fuel. We understand gas is not a low-emissions fuel but does play an important part in helping power communities by firming peaking electricity and as a feedstock and source of heat for industry. We also concur with Senator Bragg's view that Australia should be a first-mover in legislating an emissions disclosure regime. We are committed to ensuring large businesses, including financial institutions, provide Australians and investors with greater transparency and accountability when it comes to climate related plans, risks and opportunities. The Treasurer is leading work to introduce a standardised, internationally aligned reporting requirement to ensure that climate related disclosures are usable, credible and comparable, which will be informed by substantial consultation. The government does not, however, agree with Senator Bragg's recommendation to lift the nuclear energy prohibition. This is a distraction from the need to implement cuts to pollution now to meet our targets and to put downward pressure on power bills through the deployment of renewable energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank Senator David Pocock for his contribution to the Senate committee inquiry and his genuine engagement with the government to discuss the bills. As a result of those discussions, the government will be agreeing to a number of amendments relating to the transparency and content of the annual statement to parliament and the Climate Change Authority's advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government does not accept the other recommendations in the report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that some opposition senators have raised concerns about this bill enabling climate litigation. The legislation does not change the statutory decision-making for other legislative schemes, such as the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The idea that it gives rise to new causes of action or litigation against resources projects is just another excuse. BP submitted to the Senate inquiry:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… our hope is that by legislating the target and providing a transparent and accountable framework for its delivery, the legislation might even reduce the uncertainty that can sometimes be a driver for litigation</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Santos, when questioned on the risk of litigation, said, 'No.' The Department of Climate Change, Energy the Environment and Water submission stated this: 'The bills do not create new legal risks for the Commonwealth.' They explained that the bills are different from the UK bills, so the same risks do not apply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is typical of the objections so frequently raised by the opposition. They are so often prosecuting concerns that seem to be shared by them alone and are out of step with agriculture leaders, with business leaders, with not-for-profits and, indeed, with common sense. The truth is that those opposite have been too busy arguing with themselves to do anything over the past decade. They squabbled their way through 22 energy policies and in their last year of government oversaw one of the biggest spikes in emissions in 15 years.</span>
