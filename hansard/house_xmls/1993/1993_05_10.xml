The 45th annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission is being held this week in Japan. Australia takes to that meeting a very clear and unequivocal position. We oppose all commercial whaling and support worldwide protection of all whales and dolphins. We also support the French proposal for a whale sanctuary in all the Southern Ocean south of 40 degrees.

         There has been a great deal of media speculation about the possibility of the International Whaling Commission supporting the resumption of some commercial whaling. I wish to assure this Parliament that, if such a proposal is put to a vote, Australia will oppose it. We will continue to lead the push to maintain the global moratorium put in place in 1985-86 and I am confident that we will get enough support from other countries to ensure that that ban remains.

Australia, of course, fully supports that proposal but, unfortunately, I am not confident that it will receive the 75 per cent majority needed for it to be implemented this year. If that proposal is defeated—and obviously I hope that it will not be—I and the Government are determined that Australia will lead the campaign to ensure that it is successful next year.

Australia will offer to host an intercessional planning meeting to facilitate that work.

         last night, said that small industry players had told him they would be able to set up a pay TV system for a fraction of the cost suggested by network applicants. He said that American networks miscalculated their bids when vying for pay TV licences in the United States—and I quote:

If he thinks that the process will reveal more in licence fees, what is the basis for the claim by the Leader of the Opposition that the process is a shambles?  Senator Alston is saying that the process is likely to produce more proceeds for the Commonwealth because the smaller players say they can afford more money for the licences. I should have thought that was a total endorsement of the Government's policies.

         —I thank the honourable member for his question. On the matters raised by the honourable member, there is basically some very good news in the statistics that have come through. Total enrolments for 1993 have risen to 583,000, an increase of 20,000, or four per cent, on 1992. That reflects growth of 40 per cent in the system since 1988 when the Government signalled its intention to significantly expand the higher education system. Total commencements in 1993 are 218,000, which is up four per cent. It is good to see that school leaver commencements have risen to 69,000 in 1993, an increase of five per cent over 1992.

         I think it reflects the fact that the majority of institutions have recognised the importance of providing greater opportunities for school leavers to go on to higher education. I think that bespeaks very well of the activities of the previous Minister for higher education in his efforts last year to encourage the universities to up their percentage of school leaver intake. The Government also assisted that by providing some 11,000 additional places.

         Last year the school retention rates were substantially increased to some 77 per cent, and we have about 36 per cent of that group of year 12 high school leavers finding their way into the tertiary system. That is really where the numbers ought to be—about 36 to 40 per cent. The recent Finn study outlined that as an appropriate level of participation in the higher education system and encouraged the Government, having reached that level, to ensure opportunities were available for others in vocational education and other aspects of training, which, of course, the Government is doing. There was a very substantial increase last year too in the opportunities available for young people to attend vocational education.

         Some comparative statistics are quite interesting as far as our higher education system is concerned. I mentioned the figure of 583,000. Of course, about 550,000 of those enrolments are Australians. If we take the equivalent figures in the United Kingdom, for example, there are some 760,000 students in institutions equivalent to our universities. But the United Kingdom has a population about four times larger than ours. If it had our participation rates in higher education it would be looking at about 2 1/2 million students in British universities. By contrast, were we in the United Kingdom's situation, we would have about 200,000 students in our universities.

         —The answer to the first part of the question is yes, it is the Government's intention to achieve a Budget deficit of one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. The Government has made that declaration many times, and it adheres to that objective. It is important to do that because, as we all realise, Australia has, in relation to its economic problems, a considerable deficiency in relation to its saving efforts. A major reason for that has been that, with the economic cycle, we have had a considerable amount of public dissaving. In the medium term, it is important for us to address that so that the public dissaving is reduced and the national savings effort is improved.

         The Government accepts, therefore, that it is important for us to have a fiscal objective which gives us that savings outcome. It recognises that if that is not the case, then the balance of payments current account problem will remain a severe one for the future and will constrain growth. So it is important for us to do it. How we get to that is a matter for the Government to decide in its Budget considerations. The Government has made it clear in statements in the past by the Treasurer that in relation to taxation it does not intend to increase the overall burden of taxation. The Treasurer made that quite clear in a statement to this House on 16 September in which he said that we would not increase the overall burden of taxation.

Honourable members will recall that last year the Government passed disability discrimination legislation ensuring that over time we will be able to remove areas of discrimination in Australia where it exists within the Commonwealth Government and in terms of our national responsibilities. Honourable members would also be aware that we will very soon reach agreement with each of the States by means of the Commonwealth-State disability agreement, which will provide ongoing guarantees of funding and a much clearer outline of Commonwealth and State responsibility in the area of disability. It will also enable us to build on our commitments under the Disability Services Act to ensure that, even in very difficult economic circumstances, there are more opportunities made available for those with disabilities to participate in the work force.

It affects his own electorate very strongly. The southern bluefin tuna is an industry that is very important to Australia since last year it earned $180 million in export earnings. It is very important, therefore, for Australia that only sustainable catches are taken each year. Southern bluefin tuna are distributed throughout the Indian and Southern oceans and in the past they have been heavily over-fished, which is not in the long-term interests of Australia or many other nations. The result has been that since those stocks have been depleted, the future of the species and of the industry are under threat.

I concede what the honourable member said about the longevity of the matter, but the immediate urgency revolves around the decision of the Victorian Supreme Court, or at least one of the justices there, that the Commonwealth had to make a decision by Thursday as to whether to seek special leave from the High Court to appeal the decision in Clark's case. The court is also asking us to make decisions about a further 18 cases which are listed for the Victorian Supreme Court.

Even if one puts in the revenue share of the States, Australia is the second lowest tax country in the OECD—from memory, a decimal point away from the lowest which is the United States—I think sharing second lowest place with Japan on the last statistics I saw. Through the 1980s the Government has provided tax cuts so as to keep that tax to GDP share within those sorts of ranges. In fact, we have had it coming down. Revenue is down also at the moment because of the impact of the recession in years past on business in particular—particularly in relation to companies—and also because of the fact that the economy has been growing much more slowly and therefore receipts have been growing commensurately slowly and the share is down.

         The Leader of the Opposition said last week, `We are reviewing all elements of Fightback apart, of course, from the GST, the life of which we terminated last week'. He terminated, of course, $18 billion net proceeds from the GST, yet still has all the funding commitments of his Fightback policy, including tax cuts, which are supposedly to be funded under its policies. He says he is sticking to Fightback, but not with the GST. So he had a $6 billion to $10 billion funding hole in his original policy.

         —The most apposite remark that I think any of us heard in the last few weeks about the Australian economy was made by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths)—part of the great new young talent of the Australian Labor Party—on the Channel 9 program yesterday morning, when he likened our economy to the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Titanic
         </emphasis>
         and said that it would take a long time to turn around. The
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Titanic
         </emphasis>
         sank in April 1912 and there is no sign of the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Titanic
         </emphasis>
         's being turned around. Our economy hit the iceberg of the high interest rate policy of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) back in 1989-90 and our economy is still resting on the bottom of the ocean, unmoved by the Government's rhetoric and unmoved by the wish lists that it came to the election with.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         When we consider the economic statistics of the last few weeks, there is no doubt that the depth of our economy's problems, the depth to which it is stuck in the mud at the bottom of the ocean—to follow on with the metaphor of the Minister for Industry Technology and Regional Development—is very great. In the month of March we had a current account deficit blow-out of $2.1 billion. Our foreign debt is increasing day by day. There are still around one million people unemployed and the Government, including the Prime Minister, is claiming with unexpected honesty that its policies can do nothing to get those people back to work.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In the end, this is a country which is uncompetitive and we have a government which has no plan to improve that competitiveness, to get people back to work, to stabilise our debt and to reduce our current account problems. In this very damaging climate for our country, we have a government that has been re-elected, not only as a result of the scare campaign but also partly as a result of going on a spending spree trying to buy support in the community. The consequence is that it is building up—as the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), who is at the table, knows—a more and more serious Budget deficit problem. His department has been advising him since election day, and the Treasury has been advising the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) since election day, that this is a massive problem that the Government has to address.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         If there is one issue that Ministers outside the public eye have been agonising over during the last few weeks it is the size of the Budget deficit that they have created as a result of the election bribes they made. It is not surprising that even the Governor of the Reserve Bank, in an almost unprecedented manner after the election, came out and simply hammered the Government for not having an effective policy to deal with the Budget deficit.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         When we look at what the Government did during the election campaign, we can see that on top of the One Nation promises, there was something like $2.6 billion worth of spending promises in the invest in the nation program between 1993-94 and 1996-97. That $2.6 billion assumes that the Government will get $1.6 billion in revenue from selling part of the Commonwealth Bank and $1.7 billion from bringing forward company tax collections. So if we strip away those one-off benefits, we are talking about a blow-out of something like $3.6 billion from
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Invest in the nation
         </emphasis>
         alone between 1993-94 and 1996-97. On 24 February, the Labor Party launched its policy and there was well over $1 billion worth of spending commitments in the same period in that policy launch.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         So we get to this year's Budget and the deficit expected is something in the vicinity of $16 billion. That is about four per cent of GDP—a big blow-out from the $13.4 billion that the Government proposed in its phoney figures at the time of the Budget. When we look at the cumulative Budget deficits—and this is the critical point—that the Government has been building up between 1991-92 and in the period to 1996-97, the figures are just staggering.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Macquarie Bank estimates that the cumulative deficit will be somewhere in the vicinity of $88,000 million. Access Economics estimates that the figure will be very similar: $83,000 million. Taking the Treasurer's best case scenario, the figure could be no lower than $65,000 million. These are Bills which will have to be paid for by future generations in this country and are Bills which, above all, have been accumulated in the cause of getting the Labor Party re-elected. If ever there was an example of fiscal recklessness, it is the policy and strategy that the Labor Party has undertaken over the last couple of years in order to try to stay in office.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The impact of this fiscal recklessness on our country will simply compound the enormous fundamental problems that we have. For example, nobody is arguing with the proposition that running an enormous Budget deficit, as the Government is, is a drain on our national savings. No-one is arguing with the proposition that running enormous Budget deficits is keeping interest rates higher than they need be and that real interest rates in this country are amongst the highest in the OECD, which of course is not conducive to ensuring that there is a recovery of investment and, therefore, employment.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         But what has the Government been saying about it? At the end of last year, the Treasurer, who for some reason is absent today, put out a press release exhorting Australians to go out and spend. `Spend, spend, spend' was the cry of the Treasurer at a time when national savings were at crisis point. Then four months after the election the very same man put out a press release saying that Australians should not be spending but saving. Within four months we went from `Spend, spend, spend' to `Save, save, save'. They are not the words of a Treasurer, that is not the mind of a politician, who is set towards building confidence in this country and confidence in the way the economy is being managed.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This enormous Budget deficit is contributing to the major savings problem that Australia has. A week or so ago the ANZ bank produced a paper showing that we have the lowest level of savings in this country since 1974, that all of our investment at the moment is being financed from overseas and that we are also borrowing from foreigners in order to finance some of our current consumption.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         At the end of the day, with this large number of problems that the Government has created for itself, what is it proposing to do about, above all, its gigantic Budget deficit? There are really two things that the Government has been talking about since the election. The first is its commitment to break some of its election promises. The second is the perfectly clear indication we now have both from answers in Question Time today—including the Prime Minister's dorothy dix question that he arranged through one of his advisers passing a question back to one of the backbenchers—and from leaks that have been strategically directed to different newspapers that the Government will increase a whole range of taxes. As I will explain in a minute, it will do that in a very regressive and damaging way.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Let us have a look at the broken promises. On 24 February, included in the policy speech of the Prime Minister was the promise that no age pensioner would pay tax by 1995, yet within a week of the election the Treasurer came out and said that he would renege on the promise that the Government made that by 1995 no age pensioner would pay tax. A week after the election the Treasurer explained that, in the words of the Watergate saga, that promise was `inoperative'. We had the promise during the election campaign that $100 million would be spent to buy private hospital places to try to reduce the hospital waiting list. In the last few days, Senator Richardson has explained that that promise too is likely to be `inoperative'.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         We will see on the other side of the ledger an increase in a raft of different taxes. Today, at an Evatt Foundation function, the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), one of the Government's most senior members, made some very revealing remarks when he said that Australians had to learn to understand that high levels of unemployment will be with us for a very long time—a great indictment of his own management and the management of the Labor Party. He also said that we had to accept that we would need to revive the welfare state in this country and that that would have to be funded—this is the revealing thing the honourable member for Bonython told the Evatt Foundation at lunchtime today—from increases in taxation. The honourable member for Bonython, one of the most senior members of the Government, has already let the cat out of the bag.

         But so has the Minister for Finance, who is at the table. When he was asked a question today about higher taxes, we had in his answer that mealy-mouthed stuff about how the Government was not going to increase taxes—as a proportion of GDP was what he really meant. He said the overall burden of taxes was not to be increased. That does not mean we will not all end up paying taxes but that the Government will not increase taxes as a proportion of GDP.

         What is the Minister really saying? What he is really saying is that the Government is going to go ahead with the tax cuts in 1994 and 1996, if it is still in government. It is perfectly clear what the Government is going to do. It is going to finance those tax cuts with a range of new, imaginative, indirect taxes and through increases in some indirect taxes that already exist.

         Look at it another way. What the Government is really saying is that to help our economy it is going to spend a whole lot of extra money and—we promise, we promise—we are going to pay for it one day. The way the Government is going to pay for it is by introducing new taxes. This particular strategy, as Allan Greenspan recently pointed out to the Economic Club of New York, is a strategy that would stagnate the economy eventually and all the gains that might possibly be made through this very staggering, very slow, cyclical upturn would simply be lost. The truth is coming out day in and day out.

         The Government is proposing to change the wholesale sales tax system. What does that mean?

Remember Mr Cain and Mr Neville Wran. They used to have a practice which was called hollow logging—saying to business enterprises that they wanted higher dividends from them and sucking more money out of them. The Minister at the table is a great fan of this scheme.

          What the present Government is going to do is suck higher dividends out of these government business enterprises. Organisations like Telecom, Australia Post and the Federal Airports Corporation are going to compensate for that by increasing their charges. It is just another form of taxation. The really interesting thing about these new taxes is that they are hikes in indirect taxes and business costs because there is no input credit on these taxes. They are simply going to increase business costs. They are more than that. These taxes genuinely are regressive.

         It is all very well to say that people are going to get income tax cuts but the people who are not going to get those tax cuts are those earning less than $20,700 a year—that is, over 40 per cent of taxpayers—and people on fixed incomes. Those people will pay the higher taxes, but there will be no compensation. That was the burden of the Government's argument against the GST. That argument was wrong. The Opposition provided compensation but the Government is increasing indirect taxes which will increase costs to business in this country, at a time when Australia is uncompetitive, and increase costs to low income Australians and pensioners and others on fixed incomes, making their lives all the more miserable than they already are.

No-one says that is an exceedingly rapid rate of growth, but it is certainly not an economy which is stuck in the mud, to use the term of the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo.

         The Australian economy, like the rest of the industrialised world, has been through a recession. It is leading most of the other countries out of that recession and had a growth in 1992 of 2 1/2 per cent. That is in excess of the rate of growth for the industrialised world, which is less than two per cent—1.8 per cent on the International Monetary Fund figures. For next year, 1993, we would certainly again be ahead of the rest of the world because the IMF forecast is for the world economy to grow at about 2.2 per cent in 1993, and we will certainly do better than the 2.4 per cent that we recorded in 1992.

         The economy is far from being stuck in the mud. It is an economy coming out of recession. It might not be screaming out of recession, in the way it did in the early 1980s, but neither is any other country's economy at this time. Many countries are finding it exceedingly difficult to get out of recession at all. Some, such as Germany, are still stuck in it—countries with the most dynamic post-war economies in the industrialised world. The situation must be put in some perspective. What the Opposition is saying is just ludicrous. It is still in election mode, trying to tell the people about the economy in a way that is totally out of whack with reality. The Opposition should realise that the election is over and that it can afford to be franker these days.

         The shadow Treasurer also said that we have an uncompetitive economy; that we are not doing anything to improve competitiveness. Since the Government came into office, Australia's international competitiveness—and indices published by the Treasury bear out this fact—has increased by 30 per cent. We have one of the lowest inflation rates in the Western world. Productivity is increasing with the introduction of the enterprise bargaining approach to wage fixation, together with the micro-economic reforms that have been taking place at an unprecedented rate for the last several years. As a result, our competitiveness has increased very considerably.

         It is therefore absurd—those opposite are away with the fairies—to suggest that we are not increasing our competitiveness. We have been doing it year after year. The Australian economy is much more competitive now. That is the major reason for the development of a high rate of growth in manufactured exports, one of the great features of the economy in recent years. If the Opposition cannot recognise that that is happening and why it is happening, then it has a terribly long way to go before it can claim to be a true alternative government.

         This debate is really about the size of the Budget deficit and what is to be done about it. It is true that there has been an increase in the Budget deficit. We have moved away from the surplus of the late 1980s when, for three years, we recorded the only Budget surpluses in Australia since the introduction of the modern form of Budget accounting in the 1950s. The only Budget surpluses, therefore, have been recorded under this Government. We have moved away from those surpluses in recent years under the effect of the recession. That naturally happens because of loss of revenue and the additional expenditure that must be outlaid by the Government.

         In Australia, as in every other industrialised country, the Budget situation has deteriorated. There is no doubting that that is the case. In some countries the deterioration has been infinitely more rapid than in Australia. For example, the United Kingdom had surpluses at the end of the 1980s but, as the latest International Monetary Fund figures show, it had a deficit equal to 6.2 per cent of GDP in its 1992 general government fiscal balance. The figure for Australia was 4.5 per cent, so there has been a much greater deterioration in the United Kingdom. In Italy the figure was 10.2 per cent; in Canada, 6.4 per cent; and in the United States, 4.6 per cent. Those figures represent a deficit as a proportion of GDP, and all of them are higher than Australia's.

         The Opposition's argument proceeds on the basis that there is something unique happening in this country. It is saying that it is only because we have a Labor government that we are seeing a deterioration in the Budget outcome; that we have such a terrible Budget deficit solely because of the fiscal irresponsibility of the Labor Government; that if only the Government had more appropriate policies then there would be a nice Budget surplus. That is a total delusion and it is totally out of step with the reality that faces every Western industrialised country, all of which have had a deterioration in their Budget outcomes.

         It is not surprising that Australia has that figure. As I said at Question Time, that is not something that we can nevertheless be relaxed about. It is not something where we can simply say, `We do not have to worry about that', even though the results of that outcome are largely unavoidable. They are not entirely unavoidable; we could have had a better Budget outcome in terms of a lesser Budget deficit if we had not put a stimulus into the economy—if we had not taken the measures that we took in the One Nation package and in the Budget to provide some stimulus to the economy to get it growing again. But, in my view, in the view of the Government and, I think, in the view of most people, that was a very appropriate policy, because it was designed to give the economy the impetus to get back onto a growth path. If we had not done that, we would have had much lower growth than we have at the present time, and more unemployment. Apparently that is what the Opposition thinks we should have. It thinks we should stick to the toughest possible Budget outcome, and in the process not care about the fact that it does not give the economy any growth, and that we have higher levels of unemployment.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That is not the Government's position. The Government, having taken that step to have responsible stimulus—as have most other countries in the Western world—recognises that that has to be taken back in the course of the next few years as the economy grows out of recession. Some of the stimulus that we have given in One Nation and the Budget will automatically come to an end because it is only there for a couple of years. So, as the economy recovers, tax revenues will pick up, budget outlays will start to decline as unemployment levels fall, and so the Budget will go through a process of some automatic repair, just as it went through a process of automatic deterioration with the recession.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          So we can see that in the medium-term there is going to be an improvement in the Budget outcome simply by the processes that I have just outlined.

         The real question is: can we get back to a deficit of one per cent of GDP by 1996-97 simply by relying on those automatic features, or will some further steps need to be taken by the Government to ensure that that is the outcome? It is important that that is the outcome because, as I said at Question Time, this is a factor which is related to the need for a better savings effort by the nation, and that in turn is very important in ensuring that we do not have a current account problem. There is a direct relationship between the investment savings gap and the balance of payments current account gap. Unless we address that feature, then we must recognise that we are not going to address the current account, whatever else we do.

The question then is: what sorts of steps do we need to take? At this stage it is not possible or appropriate for the Government to answer that. The Government will certainly be aiming to ensure that it achieves that one per cent outcome by 1996-97. In the forthcoming Budget for this year we will outline not just a Budget for 1993-94, but also a Budget scenario for the next few years to indicate the ways in which we will be likely to get to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97, and to indicate what steps we will be taking to ensure that that is the outcome.

         The Opposition has already decided that that means that there are going to be big increases in taxes, and it is even telling us what those taxes will be and how unfair they will be. This is just lulu land stuff and totally absurd conjecture. The Government has no intention of introducing unfair taxes of the kind that the Opposition wanted to introduce in the form of the goods and services tax, and we have made it clear that that is definitely not part of our agenda; nor is it part of our agenda to make the tax system less fair. In the time that this Government has been in office it has been repairing the tax system to make it much fairer, tighter and less open to rorts—hopefully not open to any rorts at all these days, compared with when we came into office—and to make it much more equitable. We are not about to undo any of that in the process of putting together a fiscal policy to achieve the medium-term outcome that I have outlined.

         So it is the case that this Government is facing up to the need to adopt the appropriate fiscal policy.

The Opposition condemned us for doing that and clearly would rather have had much more unemployment. We recognise that in the foreseeable future we have to repair that Budget outcome so that it will give us a much better savings outcome.

         We have appointed the Fitzgerald committee, which is to report to the Government by the middle of this year on savings, and clearly that may have some implications for the Budget.

We hope that the Fitzgerald report will give us the opportunity to take further steps in that direction.

We need to have positive savings as a nation—not to be dissaving as we have been recently—and therefore be able to rely on those savings to finance our investment rather than have to import funds with the concomitant feature of a continuing current account deficit.

They are all patently absurd. The shadow Treasurer probably, in his heart, realises this. If he does not, then he has an awful lot to learn.

The product that they previously made now comes back into Australia and is landed here, after freight, and of a comparable quality, for 30 per cent less than it could be produced in Australia. That particular company has reduced its employees to doing things like unloading the container on the wharf and distributing the product within Australia.

         As the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), said, our savings policy is absolutely shot. Savings in this country are at their lowest level since 1974. I do not have to remind honourable members who was in power then. Last year's December quarter figures showed that savings had fallen by another $850 million, which was the seventh successive fall in a row. They had fallen on only one other occasion in the last 20 years, and that was over two quarters in the 1982-83 recession. Now we have had seven successive falls. It is an unbelievable position. We have unprecedented levels of borrowing from overseas, not just for investment but, more alarmingly, also for consumption. In a sense, we are selling off Australia's interests to overseas interests for the simple reason that we are spending more than we are producing and we are spending more than we are earning.

But this Prime Minister's solutions involve pretending that this Government is doing the above things and pretending it is making industrial relations reforms, although he virtually read out the coalition's policy, but then tacked on at the end—after a few phone calls from Bill Kelty—that the unions must be involved, which almost ensures that it will stall again.

But the media has fallen for it and presumably we are to take it seriously. He is going to spend more on a referendum than the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has just offered the woolgrowers of this country. I think nothing more indicates the sick state of this Government's priorities than that.

         All the time the deficit mounts and there is upward pressure on real interest rates. It is true that we have a low inflation rate in this country because the economy is comatose; it is about one per cent. But interest rates are about 10 per cent and that is making us uncompetitive. The Minister for Finance, who is at the table, might deny it, but it is making us uncompetitive in the business world, particularly compared with overseas countries. So we have the Prime Minister preaching nationalism while at the same time practising anti-Australian values. I believe that his actions will, in effect, ensure that we will be less independent, that we will be more beholden to overseas interests than we have been.

         While all this is going on, the problem worsens. Just about every Government forecast since I have sat in this place has been shot to pieces—and who would forget that famous one, `If you can't make 4 3/4 per cent growth, you ought to give the game away'. Even if we could make three per cent growth now we would be standing still or falling behind in many areas. Our trade balance worsens every day. The Prime Minister, in nine different statements since he has been Prime Minister, has made 153 promises amounting to thousands of millions of dollars over and above what the Government was spending before. The position is totally untenable. The Government knows it. It knows it has to break those promises. It has already broken some—the one about pensioners paying tax and ones like that. It is going to have to break others. In particular, it will have to break its biggest promise—the personal income tax cuts. It has deceived the people to get into office and it will continue to do so in the lead-up to the next election. In the meantime, the country continues to go down the gurgler.

         Central to the issue before the Parliament at present is the question of how much the Government spends, how much of the national resources we are consuming in Government, how much of the money that we are collecting we are spending, and whether or not we are spending too much. Let us look at Government expenditure as it now stands, as well as the central government deficit. As the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has already mentioned, the 1992-93 Budget sets out a central Government deficit of 3.3 per cent. The December 1992
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          OECD Economic Outlook
         </emphasis>
         records a central government deficit in the United States of 5.8 per cent, which is substantially higher than in Australia. The United Kingdom, adopting the sorts of policies which those opposite are still espousing, has a central government deficit of 6.3 per cent. Italy has a central government deficit of 10.6 per cent and Canada has a central government deficit of 3.4 per cent.

         The fact of life in OECD countries is that private sector investment has gone down and sensible, responsible government action has been taken in all of them to generate increased economic activity. At the same time we must recognise that revenues of all those governments, including Australia's, have fallen. The facts of life are that our 3.3 per cent deficit in this financial year is well below the OECD average, lower than any of the G7 countries. It is a very modest stimulus to the economy, but one which those opposite would not have delivered.

         In the election just past those opposite went to the people of Australia promising not to increase economic activity but to choke it—to withdraw funds from the economy and to top that off with an inequitable tax—which the people of Australia have resoundingly rejected. If we look not just at the present but at the past, it is interesting to note what the philosophies of those opposite in practice have delivered to the people of Australia. Since the current methods of accounts were kept in our Budget documents from 1951 to the current time we have had 42 Budgets. Those opposite have delivered 29 of those 42 Budgets. I ask the question of those opposite: out of the 29 Budgets that they delivered whilst they were in government through that period, how many balanced Budgets or surplus Budgets did they deliver? The answer is zero, nil.

         Not since Bob Menzies got the thought of forming the Liberal Party have those opposite delivered one surplus Budget. In fact, the record shows quite clearly that the only surplus Budgets that stand on the record since the current methods of account have been kept were the Budgets from 1987-88 to 1990-91, delivered by this Labor Government, by the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister (Mr Keating).

         They are the stark facts of life that the record shows and which those opposite would do well to learn by. Their performance today demonstrates that they have learnt very little from it. In those four Budgets in which we recorded a surplus, we amassed a surplus of some $18 billion; that is $18 billion effectively saved in the Commonwealth coffers which, coincidentally, is about the same amount as those opposite overspent during their last period in office.

         One of the other yardsticks that is important in this debate about how much money we should get through taxes and  how much we should spend is how much of the total cake, how much of the Australian domestic product, do the Government outlays consume? This year the Budget provides for government outlays of about 27 per cent of GDP. Let us measure that against past occasions. In 1982-83, the last Budget that those opposite delivered, government outlays as a percentage of GDP were higher, at 28.8 per cent. The record shows quite clearly that this Government  has  ensured  a  modest  slice  of  the gross domestic product going to the public sector.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Indeed, there is good argument in a whole range of policy areas why government outlays might be increased. But the facts of life are, and the record shows, that this Government has been about reducing the size of the economy consumed by the public sector, in spite of the protestations of those opposite mentioned earlier in this debate.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         One thing that has contributed to that reduction has also been the fact that Australia now ranks as the third or second lowest taxed country in the OECD. Putting those things together we find a Labor government record in which government outlays as a percentage of GDP have shrunk since we came to office, not grown; a tax regime which has seen Australian tax now at the third lowest rate in the OECD; and a central government deficit lower than the OECD average and well below those of our trading partners with whom we like to compare ourselves.

         Those are areas of the economy in which the Budget is directly involved. But, of course, in all of these things the critical factor at the end of the day is what is happening out there in the wider economy. The most important yardstick of that is what is happening with growth in our domestic product. Again, the record demonstrates the positive performance of this Government.

         Since we have been in Government we have seen this nation's economy grow substantially. Today our gross domestic product is some 25 per cent larger than it was when we came into office. At the same time we have not only made more, but we have also increased the percentage of that product which is being exported. In 1983-84 we were exporting about 14 or 15 per cent of what we made. In 1991-92 that had grown to just under 18 per cent.

So, if they are to perform the useful social and economic purposes that they will perform, then they must be passed during the next month and if they are to get to the Senate in time for them to be effectively debated there, they likewise require consideration by the House this week.

         This is the third occasion since Federation—the third occasion in 93 years—that a guillotine has been used in the first two weeks of a sitting of the new Parliament. On the two other occasions that the guillotine was used in such indecent haste, it was used under a Labor government. It was first used on 10 July 1974—I remember it well, it was my first Parliament—when we had the joint sitting of the 29th Parliament.

The excuse is that there has been a natural build-up of Bills and the Government has to get itself organised as a new government. Does the Government expect us to break down and howl about the fact that it has to reorganise itself?

         But the real objection that the Opposition has to what the Government is doing on this occasion is that it really demonstrates again that, when it comes to any sort of respect for the institution of Parliament, this Government could not give a damn. One of the courtesies that this Parliament is meant to extend is the opportunity for new members on both sides of the Parliament to have a decent Address-in-Reply debate so that they can get their maiden speeches out of the way not long after they have come into the Parliament.

         By moving this motion now, the Government is aborting the opportunity that many new members have, certainly on our side of the House, to conduct their maiden speeches on the Address-in-Reply. What kind of courtesy is that to new members? None at all. The Government does not care about new members. As far as it is concerned—whether they are on the Government's side of the Parliament or whether they are on our side—they are division-fodder.

         I think it is nothing short of disgraceful—and it shows a quite contemptuous attitude of this Government towards the processes of this Parliament—that it should bring on a guillotine. It used to be the view that the use of the guillotine was avoided unless the Government got into a desperate position at the end of a parliamentary session. Now we are invited to support a guillotine on the basis that the Government is in a desperate position at the beginning of a parliamentary sitting. If ever a government ought not to be in a desperate position, it is at the beginning of a Parliament, just after it has been returned at an election with three years of government ahead of it. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) comes along to us and says, `Please, will you support this motion because we need to have a guillotine so that we can get all of this legislation through'.

That is not my expression; that is the Prime Minister's expression.

Of course, this is the second time in a row. The motion was moved in May 1990 at the convening of the 36th Parliament and it was moved on this occasion at the convening of the 37th Parliament. The Opposition will oppose the motion because it represents an expression of the Government's contempt for the role of parliament in the constitutional processes of this country.

The Government is not really sure whether the two people who will have a say in the final decision in that place will be as easy to manipulate as some of their old mates who are departing this place, particularly those amongst the Democrats. The Government is just not taking any risks. We have Bills such as the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill 1993 and others where the Government is not really trying to promote the cause of the people of Australia but to clean up its own little messes and get itself out of some embarrassment. I do not know what the Government will do if some of its ambitions are not met within the time that it is allocating. It will not even be able to fix up any problems if its amendments are rejected in the Senate.

In the last five days, a government Minister has been standing up here saying, `We had a deficiency'. Of course, the record is full of evidence of where the Government has messed legislation up and the Parliament has had to help it out. The Leader of the House will make some remarks on that if he has time—after he has made all his remarks about how he won the debate at Ascot racecourse.

Frequently, we get that advice from members of the public because we are not experts on everything. More and more in this place the opportunity for members to consult with their various constituencies is denied them by the guillotine, by having legislation brought in on a Thursday and forced through this House the following Tuesday.

         What I am saying is that this legislation is still very contentious throughout Australia, that not everybody agrees on it and that the New South Wales Government is not really sure how it is going to apply. But there is going to be no discussion on it in this place. The members from New South Wales can say nothing; the members from Western Australia can say nothing because it will be guillotined and we will be lucky to have time for the shadow Minister's response.

          It is a piece of watershed legislation, and that is the sort of contempt that the Government shows. It comes back to a few famous statements like `Question Time is a courtesy handed to the Parliament by the Executive'. It is like the contempt that was shown to Speaker Cope.

         All of these matters are significant and contiguous with what we are on about today, further and further lowering the reputation of this place, and in the process elevating the position of the Senate. If honourable members opposite think that is a good idea, they are going to be given the opportunity to vote on it in a minute. We know how that vote is going to come out. A large number of people will vote for it—80, I think the Minister reminded us the other day. He believes that justice resides in the numbers. But with 80 people voting for it, that means that there are 80 people that do not give a damn for this place as an institution. They are going to vote it down just like a few people previously voted down Speaker Cope. I remind the Minister that his father was not one of them because his father at least had some respect for this institution. He would not come in here and do such an outrageous thing. He came in and participated in the next vote, and that is evidence he was in the Parliament.

They voted for him because they thought he was going to represent them. They really and truly thought he was going to do something for them. Does he know what any of this stuff is about? Has he got a view on it? Is he worried about the circumstances of the people in his electorate, as they might be affected by this? No. He will not be talking on any of it. He will put his hand up when the Government tells him. It will be a long time before he asks a question about the people who put their faith in him. He will get little bits of paper, but let me remind him that when he gets a question from a Minister, and his instructions from the Whip to ask it, he should make a point of reading it. There are a number of very embarrassed members in this place who have actually asked questions that were out of order, written by Ministers' officers—quite a frequent occurrence. So I just give him a little bit of advice while he is new around the place: he should just read the questions put under his nose.

The Leader of the House says, `Guillotine it through, I will back you up; and if it compounds upon my people, too bad. The Labor Party is still in government'. That is the problem, and he has just demonstrated how he is going to go. We know him from here on in. He has another totally silent mate up there. I will give him the benefit of the doubt.

If we have so much important legislation that has to be put through by the end of June we can come back next week. The reason why they are all smiling, the reason why they are not going to come back next week, is that they are going to clear off overseas.

         I was interested to read of the goings on in Caucus last Wednesday night. When a Labor Party member does not become a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary, he should not despair, because the prizes do not end with being a Minister of the Crown. The prizes start with being a Minister. Second prize is being a Parliamentary Secretary. The third prize is being the Government Whip. The other prizes of course are being the committee chairmen. Do we not have a lot of committee chairmen over there with their snouts right in the trough. I see the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). Honourable members on this side of the House know he is a keen international traveller, but what we did not realise was that as Chairman of the Public Works Committee he picked up an extra 11 1/2 grand prize for winning that. I think he has got the safest Labor seat in New South Wales. We know the reason why these fellows are putting this legislation through today is that they are all off on these gravy trains around the world at the taxpayers' expense. That is why they are not prepared to debate the serious issues.

         I am reminded of just how often this Government ducks when the going gets tough. I was just reading a speech a few minutes ago about how this Government introduced the guillotine on the Australia card debate. Remember the debate on the Australia Card back in 1989. The Australia card was highly controversial and was opposed by a broad section of our society. The Bill was introduced by this Government. What did the Government do when the Bill was before the House? We did not debate it as one would expect a matter as important as that would be debated. We had a guillotine. I think the total debate allowed for the Australia Card in this House was an hour and a half. Government members were not prepared to face up to the views of other people in our society who were opposed to the Australia Card. Thank God there were enough people in Australia who stood up, and we saw that Bill disappear. It is this type of thing that we are seeing today.

         The Government is on the back foot in the first week of the Parliament. When the Government should be basking in the glory of its successful election campaign—it has come back after a win, and good luck to it—when the first week or two should be its crowning glory, it is on the back foot. Why? Because the Government has made a complete mess of the pay TV issue—an issue involving the investment of billions of dollars and affecting the future of communications in Australia into the next century and beyond. What is the Government doing about it? There is to be a little debate on the issue in the legislation that is to be guillotined—guillotined because the Government does not want to listen to the Opposition highlighting the inadequacies in the legislation. That is why the legislation is being whipped through at maximum pace.

         My well-known colleague the honourable member for Bennelong, who spoke before me, referred to the Road Transport Charges Bill, an item of legislation which falls within my shadow portfolio. I have looked at the legislation and, interestingly enough, it is a Bill which only applies to the ACT. There is no urgency in introducing the legislation because it does not need to be enacted until about the middle of next year when other States enact similar legislation. There is no reason for the Bill to be enacted in a hurry. Likewise, the substance of the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 1993, the last item on the list provided by the Leader of the House, is a very minor amendment which would allow the Dairy Board to borrow money and make hedging arrangements so that it can act in line with other  statutory  authorities under  the Government's wing. If the board has lived without those rights for the last few years, it can live without them for a few more months. There is no urgency attached to that particular legislation.

         This is a very serious matter indeed. I do not want to come back here next week, but I take the view that I have been elected to come here to do a job which entails giving proper consideration to matters put before us. A large number of matters have been put before us today which are to be subjected to the guillotine. I do not know whether any one matter is ultimately more important than another. I personally take a great deal of interest in matters concerning veterans affairs, and that is one matter that is listed. What concerns me is that when the guillotine has been applied on previous occasions there have been consequential delays in enacting the legislation. To think that decisions can be made and votes taken without any debate at all is absolutely disgraceful, and that has happened on occasions. It has also often occurred that proper consideration has not been given to matters and we have had to come back at another time to correct the problem that we have created. There are numerous examples that I can cite of such unintended consequences.

If I am not here to debate and take part in the process properly, what am I here to do? Will the Leader of the House answer that question for me? I do not ask that question facetiously.

However, because I am paid to do a job I would happily come back next week to do the job properly. I am prepared to do that, as are all honourable members on this side of the House. Why is the Government not prepared to do so? I ask the honourable member for Brisbane, because we often participate in debates, how he views this process. How does he justify this process? The Government shows by what it is doing today—as the honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) have both said—that it has contempt for the process. But it goes beyond that: it shows how little consideration the Government has for propriety, for convention or for tradition. It wants to change everything. It is no wonder that the people of Australia are concerned about the Government's agenda. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) would like to be not only president but also dictator. The people of Australia should be very concerned about anything he proposes. Those opposite should tell me why we cannot debate important matters—whether it concerns veterans affairs or wool—otherwise, they should change their minds and do the decent thing by the people of Australia.

To use the words that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) used in Question Time last week, the Australian Parliament is ultimately the clearing house of the nation. People from diverse backgrounds and different interests put issues before the House and expect decisions, and look to the proper government of this country.

These matters were raised by the Prime Minister, and we are talking about questions that relate to the institutions of society. Yet at the same time the Government is showing such respect for this institution that it wants to cut off debate in the second week of a new Parliament and shove through legislation without permitting it to be debated entirely.

I suspect the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) secretly adheres to the proposition that each member of parliament has a responsibility on behalf of the people who put him or her here to stand up and debate any piece of legislation that is introduced into this Parliament.

Over the years we have become used to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) coming into this chamber towards the end of each session and announcing that, because of the great pressure of Government business and the enormity of the Government program, it will be necessary to limit debate on Bills. In the life of the last Parliament over half the Bills were subject to a limitation of debate. Over half of all the legislation that came into this place could not be discussed adequately. It was therefore inevitable that much of it would be recirculated; it would come back into this chamber when the obvious defects in it were discovered in the other place, or through a brief passage of implementation of that legislation.

         The Leader of the House always demonstrates how sad he is that the guillotine is occurring, but that it is tragically inevitable. None of his excuses will hold good this time. Here we are after only three sitting days, but two working days of this Parliament, and we are told that 30 Bills must be guillotined. When the Leader of the House introduced the motion, he spoke about the list being smaller than on some previous occasions. It is true that there have been longer lists, but the reality is that in this instance this list of 30 Bills represents virtually 100 per cent of the real legislation coming before the Parliament. All of it will be subject to the guillotine. There will be not one piece of legislation before the Budget session on which all members who wish to speak will have the opportunity to do so. In every instance there will be a curtailment of the debate.

         There were some new members here a few moments ago, and even they have deserted the chamber. They are obviously embarrassed that they are being asked to support their Government. Almost the first division that they participate in is one to curtail democracy, to curtail the opportunity for the Opposition to speak. What those new members need to remember is that, whilst every opportunity will be provided and every courtesy will be given to them to make their maiden speeches in these early days, next time round they will be amongst the people who will be denied the opportunity to speak. They will be amongst the people who will not have an opportunity to put the views of their electorate on a particular issue. No matter how important a matter may be to their constituency, the guillotine will be used to prevent them from exercising what they would have regarded as their right, as a member of parliament, to contribute to the debate.

         What we have is a Parliament that is scheduled to sit for only nine days in eight months between before Christmas last year and the bringing down of the Budget in the third week of August. What an abysmal record. I can remember years ago some people being critical of the Queensland coalition Government for not sitting very often, but if it had ever dared to sit for only nine days in eight months there would have been riots in the street. But nine days is what this Government considers to be adequate. One of those days, of course, was a ceremonial day taken up by the processes of the opening of the Parliament, so in fact we will have eight days of actual debating time in eight months. So it has been decided that 30 Bills will now be guillotined through by the end of this week. That is really an unsatisfactory state of affairs.

         A lot of people have referred to hidden agendas, the real reasons why the Parliament is sitting for only eight days when there are probably something like 50 or 60 potential days available. Some people have referred to the need for government members to undertake overseas trips. The other obvious reason why the Government is anxious to shorten the number of sitting days is to reduce the number of Question Times. They hope that maybe the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall) can survive three or four Question Times but know there is no way he will ever survive a dozen or 20.

         I come back to the guillotine motion. It is quite clear that this one does not come as a result of pressure of government business or any inability to adequately deal with a comprehensive program. Two debating days after the commencement of the Parliament we are being asked to agree to a guillotine. We can come to only one conclusion: that the Government's management of its legislative program is not accidental or something that is beyond the capacity of the Government. It has not been forced into a guillotine position. It is clearly a deliberate program to curtail debate. It cannot be regarded in any other way. It is a deliberate action to ensure that the legislation proposed is not subject to scrutiny, that the Opposition is denied the opportunity to raise issues, and that members of Parliament are denied the opportunity to put before this place matters of significance to their electorate.

Let him demonstrate that he is not down here just to put his hand up when the factional leader says that that is what he is required to do, that he does really believe that Australia ought to be a better place in which to live, that he wants to make a contribution to making this country a better place and that he wants an opportunity to contribute to the debate. He will only get that opportunity if he is prepared to stand up early in his career and demonstrate to the Leader of the House and to the Government that he stands for democracy, that he believes in freedom of speech, and that he believes that this chamber should be used for its intended purpose—to thoroughly scrutinise legislation and to ensure that matters that are passed and become the law of the land, are indeed in the national interest and are likely to achieve good things for the people of Australia.

         The quality of debate in this new Parliament has no doubt stooped to a very new low because, quite frankly, this guillotine means that 30 pieces of legislation will indeed be voted on without real debate. There will be division after division after division, and there will be no real discussion. The Labor Party, as part of its hidden agenda, as part of constitutional reform—it is not going to tell us openly about this—wants to do away with the Senate. After all, the Prime Minister refers to senators as pansies and unrepresentative swill. What does the Prime Minister intend to do about making the so-called unrepresentative swill more representative? It is part of his agenda to do away with the Senate. The Senate is the house of review, and if ever we need a legitimate reason for a Senate, for a house of review, we only have to look at the Government's practices here. Where would we be as a nation if we did not have a house of review when the Government bulldozes legislation through the House the way these 30 Bills are destined to be bulldozed through over the next few days?

Indeed, Miss Betty Boothroyd was elected Speaker and as a Labour member she received the support of the House.

I would have thought that after 10 years this Government would have said, `Although we have the numbers, we should extend the parliamentary sitting by a week. We should sit for more civilised hours and we should sit for more days'. After all, this nation has a million people out of work, half a million people on the long-term unemployed list and a massive foreign debt. Twenty-five per cent of our young people are functionally illiterate on leaving primary school.

         —It would be wishful thinking on the part of the honourable member for Bowman for the honourable member for Rankin to fall on his sword. I must say we will endeavour to assist the honourable member in achieving that aim because we think the honourable member for Bowman would certainly make a better Minister than does the honourable member for Rankin. No doubt the honourable member for Bowman would agree. The Government is not well represented in the chamber. The honourable member for Rankin is not here. We have the honourable member for Swan present, the honourable member for Bowman, and the `Leo killer', the honourable member for Grayndler (Ms McHugh). The honourable member for Grayndler is certainly a giant killer. Then we have the ever silent honourable member for Lilley over there in the corner. They are the only four members of the Government in this chamber at a time when we are debating probably the most important motion to come before this House since the Parliament resumed after the election. We have merely four government members who are here during our debate on democracy.

It is terrible that we see only four people from the Government in this place now. But when the division bells ring we will find people coming in one by one until such time as there is a sufficient number of them here to jackboot, to squash, democracy. It is tragic that the members of the Government are so uninterested in this place that only four of them have come in here to sit and listen to the debate. But later, when the division is held, all members of the Government will come in here because they do not support democracy. I think their absolute rejection of convention and of basic democratic decency will achieve for them increased disrespect from the people of Australia.

This Government should reconsider its position, and I implore the honourable member for Swan, the Leader of the House, to do so. When I last served in this place, he was one of the more reasonable Labor Ministers. He was a person we could talk to. I often felt he probably did not like being sent in here to do the dirty work of Hawke; he now does similar work for the honourable member for Blaxland, the present Prime Minister. Something should be done. The people of Australia are sorely disappointed that in the opening days of a new parliament we do not find reasonable time to debate, nor do we find that honourable members are able to come along here to debate the great issues of the day.

He seemed to be saying, `Oh no, not me again'. He got up; he stammered and he stuttered; he was totally lacking in eloquence. Indeed, from the way he was deserted by honourable members on his side of the House, he should know that he does not have a bright future. We saw the bravado of the Prime Minister; we saw his smile and his swagger; we remembered the con tricks on 13 March, which fooled the people of Australia into giving the Government another term.

In those 10 years I have watched many a guillotine applied. In fact, I heard the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) very eloquently point out that in the last Parliament over half of the legislation had been subject to the guillotine. He expressed some indignation at the simple fact that in this Parliament we will sit for only eight days in eight months.

         I rise now because in the 10 years I have been here I have never seen the guillotine applied as unnecessarily as I am seeing it applied this afternoon. The indignation of members of the coalition is simply because the guillotine is unnecessary. In the best of circumstances the guillotine is a form used by the Government that ought to be used hesitantly, that the Government ought to be reluctant to employ. We are here at the opening of a parliamentary session in which, as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) stressed, it is intended that we will sit in May and not in June or July, and with debate being subject to the guillotine.

They were elected, of course, six weeks before us and have yet to meet. We are told that they will go rocking into the Western Australian Legislative Assembly some time around June, if and when they feel like it. So, if the honourable member has strictures in that regard, he might, as well as delivering them in this House, give his State colleagues a bit of a phone call and suggest to them that there might be one or two things that it is worth their while talking about.

I have not noticed, when there are parliamentary breaks, an excessive presence of members of the National and Liberal parties in this place when the various parliamentary delegations are overseas. There is also the opportunity to take advantage of an account which is available to backbench members of the Parliament to travel overseas. I have not looked at that account lately, but I do not know that it is underspent by the Liberal Party or the National Party, nor do I note that any of those overseas parliamentary delegations have been ill-attended by members of the Liberal Party and the National Party.

         I am a bit depressed by the sort of self-loathing that seems to have taken over our honourable members on the other side of the House; there is no need for that. I do not believe that they are members of a house of ill-fame, as one of them characterised their situation. I do not believe that they are jokes, as two of them characterised their position, nor do I believe that this place treats them as a joke. Again referring to the unsuccessful contestant for Deputy Leader of the National Party, on the subject of parliamentary chairmen, he sought to deride them on the grounds that for the work they did as parliamentary chairmen they get an extra allowance of about $10,000 a year. Those positions actually exist because of one of the very substantial changes which has taken place in the way in which the affairs of this House have been conducted, courtesy of this Government. Far from disrespecting the House of Representatives, it is this Government that has put in place, enshrined in Standing Orders, a whole series of policy committees and surveilled policy activities. Certainly as a Minister who has had dealings with one or two of those committees, they have met to discuss items that I have sent to them; they have arrived at conclusions on items that have been sent to them; and many of those items, arrived at as a result of bipartisan decision making, have been implemented to my certain knowledge by the Government. So, far from being irrelevant, that is one of the many attributes of this Government's attitude towards the Parliament, which shows that we do not have the contempt for it that the Opposition seems to feel we have.

         The other point that arises from the fact that this Government does not feel contempt for this Parliament but respects it greatly is that we do have a very extensive arrangement now in place for the creation of private members business. The honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) asked why we operated the guillotine. Let me confess that we do operate the guillotine far more frequently than the Opposition has ever done, although the guillotine was devised, I think, by a conservative government and certainly perfected by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) when he was Manager of Government Business. I always have a feeling, as I stand here and move the guillotine, that still resident in the House is the patron saint of guillotines. As he is the patron saint of this entire process, I always pay slight homage to whatever corner the National Party leaves him in as it works him up to the ultimate element of the back bench. Having assumed that position, we ought always in these guillotine debates show proper deference to a great parliamentarian for having invented it.

         The reason we have had recourse to the guillotine and have not had recourse to closure in the way in which those opposite did for a time is that there has been a very substantial change in the sitting patterns. Honourable members will find—this year being an exception, as an election year always is—as they examine the non-election years that the numbers of days on which the Parliament sits is virtually no different from the time of the Fraser Government or governments before then. Those opposite need to ask themselves: when we have the same number of days each year that the Parliament sits, why does the Government keep moving a guillotine? The answer to that is quite interesting, if they have ever bothered to ask themselves that question. The answer lies partly in the amount of time we allow for private business.

         When I came to this place, general business Thursday beyond the first two Thursdays in a sitting never took place. There would be notices of motion for general business Thursday which would stay on the

That is the first notable difference—because we do not treat this Parliament with contempt and, particularly, we do not treat backbenchers and private members business with contempt.

         The second reason that we sit as often as we did previously but have a guillotine applied more rigorously is the application of time limits on sittings. Even with the guillotine, we do not sit much past 12.30 of a night. When I first came to this place we regularly sat until 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, even though the 11 o'clock rule had been put in place by the Whitlam Government. So the second reason that we do have these extensive guillotines is that the Government is reluctant to sit the Parliament night after night until 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning.

         The third reason why we sit as much as we did before but have more frequent recourse to the guillotine is the way in which those days were arrived at. It is easy for those opposite to trip off their lips, `Well, we will sit seven days only in the month', and then carry that through into an analysis month by month and say at the end of the period, `That is only 70-odd days'. This Parliament decided that pattern: honourable members had responsibilities in their constituencies; the parliamentary committee system was then more well-developed and there needed to be opportunities for those committees effectively to be able to operate—those parliamentary committees do not sit while Parliament is sitting—and the business is, if you like, on the side of the entire Parliament. The Government also found it convenient and useful because of the great deal more burdensome task of budgetary formulation. Our Government operates by committee much more extensively than did our opponents.

         What the old system did was this: when it was three weeks on one week off, albeit with only three days in each of those three weeks—it is now three days and four days and then two weeks off—a frequent Friday sitting would be made possible by the fact that there was only a three-day sitting. As well as the frequent Friday sitting, honourable members were much more cavalier with the 11 o'clock rule than we were. So the combination of all those factors, whilst producing no formal increase in the number of sitting days, created an enormous capacity to expand time at the expense of the health and the participation of the backbench members of Parliament.

         If those opposite do not like that, they need to sit down and think it through. If they sit down and look through the timetables of the various sittings of the Parliament, they will find a couple of days in the year at a time they were on this side of the House when they sat more often than we did. But they will not find the difference is weeks or months; they will find the difference is a few days. That might indicate the odd one or two sitting weeks at the very maximum, but they will not always find that. I have gone into the reasons why they will not find that to be the case.

         This legislation has been guillotined not because we fear the new composition of the Senate; every item is on this list because of a midyear start-up date. It does not look as though that is the case with some of the Bills on that list because they address sunset clause issues. While it looks as though some Bills are just a continuation of something that has existed before, if that is not the case, they will drop out. We do not particularly fear the composition of the Senate and, even if we did, we could do very little about it over the next few weeks.

         Much of this material is very important legislation; it  includes the wool legislation which, importantly, will substantially benefit wool producers. But the fact of the matter is those wool producers will want a conclusion by the end of next month. They will not get a conclusion by the end of next month unless this legislation goes to the Senate in the next couple of weeks. While the Government does not have the numbers in the Senate, and the Opposition does, there is a tendency to go through the legislation at a fairly leisurely bat. That consideration must be concluded by the middle of this year.

         The Opposition has asked for an explanation of why the Government has put a guillotine in place. This is the explanation. No other government of this country will be able to operate on any other basis unless it substantially cuts into private members' time; alters the two week on, two week off sitting pattern to something like it was before; and, having altered that two week on, two week off sitting pattern, it would then have to suspend the 11 o'clock rule massively and continuously and add additional days' sittings in the process. If that is what Opposition members want, they had better stand up and say so. But, as I remember it, Ric Charlesworth's reforms went through with the unanimous support of this Parliament.

          —I desire to refer to four of the Bills on the special list tabled by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley)—a total of 30 Bills. This is the first time that the list setting out the times allotted has been available. I point out to new members of the House that if they vote to support the motion relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1993 and the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1993, they are allowing a maximum of one hour for debate. Let us get down to detail. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1993, which I would have thought the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) would have some passing interest in, has been allotted five minutes for debate: from 9.25 p.m. until 9.30 p.m.

          I particularly wanted to highlight for the Leader of the House the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill 1993, which is very important legislation. It is to be dealt with on our side of the House by the Deputy Leader of the National Party and shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson). The Parliament is allowing just two hours of debate on the restructuring of the schedule of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. This is at a time when the Parliament should be giving more careful consideration to the future direction of the wool industry, to possible solutions in dealing with the wool crisis and in getting the vital wool industry back on its feet as a matter of priority.
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           I also draw the attention of the House to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1993, which is listed for just five minutes of debate. The International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill 1993—yet another important Bill—is also restricted by the guillotine.

I will not sit down before I emphasise to the House that embarking upon a guillotine as savage as this is the worst approach of any government at the start of a new parliamentary term. It is for this reason that the House divided a moment ago. We express our total opposition to the method of this particular guillotine and especially to the restriction of debate on the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill 1993, which should be addressing far more than it does and which should allow a comprehensive debate on the heartache and heartbreak facing many woolgrowers across Australia, especially those in drought affected areas.

Notwithstanding his defence of the provision of private members' business on Thursday mornings—I commend the Government's action in that regard and note the comment—it goes deeper than that. There are 30 Bills listed that are all being guillotined, including the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill 1993, and it simply is not good enough.

          —I rise to speak on this matter because I understand that during the last interval it was suggested that I was the father of the guillotine. As I regard that as quite a slur on my integrity, I thought it was necessary to say that it is really quite the reverse. I felt—and I still feel—that when there are measures such as this, debate is allowed, but then the gag is moved—and there is a subtle difference. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) needs to understand that, under the system which I used to run in this House for many years, we allowed people to speak on significant and sensitive issues. Indeed, a little while ago my colleague the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) mentioned a response that the then Leader of the House, Mick Young, made to one intervention on my behalf when I was in the position that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) now enjoys. The then Leader of the House said that he felt it was always desirable for members of this place to be able to speak on sensitive and significant legislation.

          It is because of that, and this allotment of time, that I wish to speak now. I know that the Government is in trouble about broadcasting services. We all know that the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall) has made a mess of things. If he does not resign today, it will be this week and, if not this week, it will be soon. His senior Minister should have resigned yesterday or last week because the nature of these changes is to retrospectively require the Minister to do what he should have done in the first place.

          The Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill 1993 also worries me. Too little has been said by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), but it has been said because of the urgent need to address what for so long has been the industry that has carried Australia on its back. We have a limited time to speak on this Bill: until 11.20 p.m on Tuesday, 11 May. Have honourable members ever heard anything more ridiculous? We will be able to talk about wool from 9.20 p.m. until 11.20 p.m—two hours. As the honourable member for Bennelong said, there are more rural members on this side of the House than there are on the Government side. Frankly, given the nature of the rural industry, and given the fact that honourable members on the other side of the House represent the wool industry, they ought to be up supporting me. I think it is absolutely ridiculous to allow two hours for a Bill of that character.

          Indeed, if there are matters of this character, it is the responsibility of the Leader of the House to ensure that the opportunity is given to individuals to speak when feel they can make a contribution on issues of major moment. I do not believe the guillotine is the answer. If the Leader of the House wishes to preclude debate, he can do what I used to do: allow a reasonable time for debate and then move the gag. The gag is different. The gag does not impose an arbitrary limit; indeed, it allows for flexibility. Above all, I think to do this on the fourth day of sitting of the Parliament is absolutely ridiculous.

The Government has won the election—much to the nation's regret and our chagrin—but there is no reason for it to run scared. Frankly, if the Government prides itself on being able to run this House, it has not demonstrated its ability to do it, either in those very flawed responses last week in this and the other place, or in the moving of this motion today.

          I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker—and, through you, to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley)—that to apply the guillotine like this is totally unsatisfactory. Let us face it: after all, from 1 January until the Budget comes in on 17 August we are having nine sitting days only. I suggest to the Leader of the House that the appropriate thing to do is to sit for more days. That is why we are elected to the Parliament. We are not elected to race off all the time; we are elected to be here in Parliament and to consider legislation.

          Quite frankly, I believe it is totally inappropriate that so many of us on both sides of the House will not have the opportunity to contribute to the debate and to consider legislation which is vitally important to the people of Australia. In particular, I know that the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has referred to the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993. I echo what he said and support him in his comments, because it is vitally important that there should be debate on this particular Bill.

           In my own case, I am more than concerned that the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Bill 1993 will be debated for only a short period of time. If we are considering road transport in Australia it is vitally important to consider the charges that will apply and the way that funding should be applied.

          Mr Deputy Speaker, it will come as no surprise to you if I make particular reference to the Pacific Highway. As all of us in this House know, the Pacific Highway is regarded by most Australians as having a specific and special priority for funding. We have seen in recent years two disastrous and catastrophic bus crashes which claimed a total of something like 55 lives. Twenty lives were lost at Cowper in the seat of the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods)—who I regret to see is not in the chamber—and another 35 in that horrifying and dreadful bus crash at Clybucca in my electorate of Cowper.

          In considering the appropriation Bills, which again are under guillotine and are vitally important, we need to look specifically at funding for the Pacific Highway because we have the track record of so many deaths. It is the major highway of Australia. It is not part of the national highway system, but the usage of the Pacific Highway between Sydney and Brisbane attracts the most traffic of all highways in Australia. Therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, I suggest to you—and indeed to the House as a whole—that it would be very appropriate that we dedicate more funding to the Pacific Highway.

          Like my leader, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), I am concerned that the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 will be subject to the guillotine and have only five minutes allocated to it. I think this is an absolute disgrace. I make reference in passing to the recent report of the Auditor-General into the Department of Veterans' Affairs, which suggested that there should be cutbacks in the rights of veterans. I say to the House, as I have said before on many occasions: the returned service men and women of Australia need to be protected and to have their rights sacrosanct. They risked their lives for this country.

          Of course, we are looking at the need to maintain that their rights are not taken away. I say most definitely that under no circumstances should there be retrospective legislation affecting the veterans of this country. In fact, it is vitally important that this Parliament sit more to give plenty of time to debate the legislation adequately, not to rush it through by guillotining it and chopping everybody off. It is in the interests of Australia that all members should have the opportunity to debate in full all of these Bills which are so important to our future.

        I speak for all the residents of Cowan—the more than 7,000 unemployed, the residents who join the 3,600 students unable to find a place at our universities, and the 11,144 on the waiting lists at our hospitals. I speak for Jack Tanner, a self-funded retiree, who over the last two years has had a real reduction in living standards. I speak for Tess MacLean, a proud mother of four whose husband, Ian, has served this country well in the services and continues to serve the community yet finds it difficult to find a job. A country he served with honour now offers little future in return. Yet Tess's greatest concern is in fact the future and how it will affect her children. She worries over their future education and career possibilities.

        I speak for that silent majority of the Cowan electorate—the forgotten Australians—who have lost, or are losing, their self-regard, their vision, their hope and their enjoyment of all things Australian. Certainly in Cowan, as 13 March would indicate, they have had enough. They are tired of the belligerent nature of the collective social reforms of this Government which does not provide social justice, but rather insists upon social inequality; where the disadvantaged in our community are encouraged to weaken the providers of our country's wealth.

        For instance, is it just or equitable that a single income family paying its share of tax whilst raising children has less disposable income than someone on social security benefits? The injustice is not in providing social security for those Australians who need help. The injustice is in our country, with all its natural wealth, not providing a structure which allows all Australians to provide for themselves if they have the will or the capacity to do so. But, more importantly, the injustice is in the way this Government's social policies are bludgeoning those Australians prepared to have a go and create their own and this country's wealth.

        The example I quoted is the same for all those families who earn $400 a week or less. This figure represents approximately 1,800 families in Cowan. No wonder family care givers in Cowan are forced into work to help retain a just standard of living when they would rather be developing a family social structure that could enhance their own values and just perhaps reduce the ever-increasing juvenile crime rate in Cowan. No wonder this pressure has caused 465 personal bankruptcies in Western Australia since January this year.

        Mr Deputy Speaker, is this just or equitable? Any fair-minded Australian would think not. This country's leaders would have us believe that destruction of the family unit by encouraging government provided child care is the answer. They believe forcing parents into work is healthy for this country's future. Do they not realise that our future is not with enterprise agreements, increasing indirect taxes upon small business or even introducing a scurrilous death duty tax, as I am sure they will? Our future lies with our nation's children. Yet our leaders believe in a hire purchase social structure, a buy now, pay later mentality towards government expenditure that is ripping apart this country's heritage and social stability.

Why is there an injustice developing within our community, and why is this Government seemingly ignorant of the future? The vision this Government espouses will ultimately be an apocalypse for the light on the hill their true believers of 50 years ago believed in. This Government's prophecy is based on old world thinking, where revolution was the way in which progress was achieved—revolution where the socialist core described as the `haves' class are against the so-called `have-nots'; the workers against the bosses; the community against the doctors; everyone against the police; women against men; indigenous people against new settlers; and, sadly, the us against them cry is ever increasing.

Who would have thought six years ago that before 1993 we would have seen the breaking down of the Berlin Wall, the destruction of communism and apartheid and the re-emergence of the long forgotten eastern European countries. The world's lifestyle is changing, through the rapid development of technology. The protection and insular national boundaries are breaking down through technology driven information. They say, for instance, that by the year 2000, some 80 months away, there will be 60 times more information available to us.

        We are heading towards a global village where new industries, not even yet considered,  will replace those that have served us so well. The world is in a period of transition—a transition from the industrial age to the information or technology age, a period of rapid change. This transition is changing culture, social structure and the way we do things. A new set of community values is emerging. As an example, the last period of such a transition was 200 years ago, with the Industrial Revolution when the world changed from the agricultural age to the industrial age—a period in the world's history that saw the rise and fall of many economies—with those countries prepared to look to the future and embrace the industrial age being the ones that prospered; and those countries that wanted to reflect on past glories and hang onto the past ways of doing things missing out on the opportunities that industrialisation provided.

Whilst our education system remains based upon industrial age thinking, we will continue to train our youth for industries, professions and employment which are rapidly becoming outdated. Whilst we pursue the outdated social justice agenda of the industrialised union movement, we will continue to drag current industry to a Third World ethos and withhold investment in new world thinking industries.

        A first speech in the national Parliament only gives me a few minutes to express gratitude to colleagues, as well as to place on record my primary interest in national and local affairs. Since I was in my early twenties, politics has been the overriding concern of my professional life. I have been very fortunate—indeed, I think some people would say lucky—in my political involvement. Over the last five years as State campaign director for the Queensland branch of the Australian Labor Party, and as State secretary, I have had the privilege of participating in a new era of political reform in my State. The election of the Goss Government in 1989 heralded a long overdue era of reform in my State.

Today I take the opportunity to place on record some of the people who have played a part in that development. To begin with, I would like to pay tribute to my late parents, whose retirement was cruelly cut short by ill health. Neither my mother nor my father thought that the world owed them a living. They taught their family the value of hard work, to have respect for their fellow citizens, and to always help those in need. They believed in an Australia where every person had the right to a fair go, where ordinary people would be able to fulfil their dreams, regardless of where they came from or the social group they were born into.

The sacking of the Whitlam Government in 1975 pushed me into deeper political involvement. In 1978 I went to work for two of the great warriors of the Labor movement—Mick Young and Bill Hayden. With them I received much of my early schooling in politics. They taught me the traditions of the Labor movement, and they taught me the fundamental importance of social justice.

        I was fortunate enough to be born into a privileged generation that took full employment for granted. It is an awesome responsibility to enter this Parliament at a time when unemployment exceeds 10 per cent and long-term unemployment is approaching half a million. The social cost of unemployment places enormous responsibility not just on politicians in this House but also on academics, industrial leaders and everyone in our community not to tap the mat and say, `There is nothing we can do'.

With unemployment, Australia faces the fourth greatest challenge of its first century of federation—a challenge as great as those presented by two world wars and the great depression.

I therefore applaud the commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) to tackle this problem head on.

        However, hindering the development of appropriate interventionist policies over the past few decades has been the unhealthy dominance of laissez-faire economists in universities, in the bureaucracy, in private industry and in the conservative parties.

        These ideologues believe that as the rich get richer they generate something called the trickle-down effect. After 12 years of Presidents Reagan and Bush, most of the United States is still waiting for the first few drops. In America, a decade of laissez-faire economics has produced even greater inequality and appalling social services. This evening I refer to the bastion of laissez-faire dogma in this country. It is found not only in the conservative parties but also in the Industry Commission. We should consider that in some depth. From reading the reports of the Industry Commission, it seems that the only role the commission would have for government is building barbed wire fences and providing police around the suburbs to keep out the non-existent unemployed.

        I commend to members of this House a recent paper by John Quiggin of the Australian National University in which he convincingly demonstrates that the economic models used by the Industry Commission are significantly flawed. There is a kind of callousness about the Industry Commission language which makes the early Scrooge look very generous. In his paper Quiggin picks up on the wording of a section of the Commission's report in 1990-91 referring to structural change in the economy. The Industry Commission says:

       The implication of that statement is that no unemployed person should ever receive any special assistance. In other words, forget about the unemployed—just find the level playing field and all will follow. I believe the commission never asks the essential questions. I think we should take some time to ask them here this evening. On the commission's dream level playing field what balls are the players playing with? How many are in the teams?

        The point is that, just as in any football match, so in economic conditions there are many factors which need to be considered. The problem is that to the ideologues of the Industry Commission these are variables which do not compute and therefore do not exist, and they never recognise the injured on the field. The best societies are those where the Government is always working to create conditions in which markets and industry can function, and where there are strong government social policies. The great strength of the Keating Government, and the Hawke Government before it, was that unlike the United Kingdom and the United States, in the 1980s Australia did not throw the baby out with the bathwater and completely adopt laissez-faire economics in all of its economic policies. In the 1980s we led the world with a national health care system and a financially sustainable social security net. We maintained the belief in a strong industry policy, and we succeeded in creating an outward looking, export orientated framework for our industry, as the recent McKinsey report demonstrates.

But, beyond industry policy there is a range of very important social policies that must be developed. I want to refer to only one or two this evening. The development of language skills, especially Asian languages, will be crucially important in this coming decade. Here, Queensland has developed a world leading program where it matters—in primary schools where there are currently something like 60,000 students learning a language other than English. Queensland is now leading Australia in foreign language education. I believe foreign language education is an essential ingredient to us becoming an export orientated trading nation, as well as one that is culturally tolerant and understanding. I believe it will be in firms like Sastek in the 21st century that many of these Asian speaking students will be located and will find jobs.

        This initiative from the Queensland Government is yet another sign of just how much our State has changed since the election of the Goss Government. I believe Queensland was once an enclave, setting itself apart from the rest of Australia. Queensland is now a national leader, economically and socially, and the program of foreign languages in primary schools is but one example of that leadership.

No group of people in my community is more deserving of representation than the aged. People who have worked and contributed to our nation throughout their lifetime are deserving of our support in their retirement. The record of the Labor Government in aged care over the past decade has been very substantial. Just over 22 per cent of the population of Lilley is aged over 60 years, which is about 50 per cent above the national average. So aged care programs are vital in my electorate.

All but a few trenchant critics understand that the true symbol of our independence is an Australian head of state. Many of the older generation, including the war generation like my father, are quite happy to accept the republic, but they do feel uneasy about changes to the flag. Much of this stems from sentiment about fighting under the flag in past wars. The sentiment about the flag in the older generation is there.

        It was the Labor Government which commissioned the first survey of Australian racing in 1991. The financial impact estimated by that survey of the racing industry was $6 billion. It is almost as big as the car industry, and bigger than the printing industry. I believe that the racing industry is ideally placed to participate in our export drive into Asia. The survey I referred to earlier recommended a one-off conference involving selected industry representatives to chart the future of the racing industry in this country. I assure the industry that it has my full support in that endeavour, and I will also be seeking the support of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly).

        I contend, Mr Speaker, that Mallee is the most significant of all the seats represented in this House. I would like to justify that bold boast. It is a rural and provincial electorate, 67,000 square kilometres in area, in the north-west of Victoria, stretching from the Grampian mountains in the south and the Glenelg River right up to the mighty Murray River in the north; and from the South Australian border in the west to the Avoca River in the east.

        It is important to mention that this huge area of Victoria was once represented in this House by 2 1/2 seats. In addition to the original seat held by Sir Winton Turnbull, was the seat of Wimmera held by Bob King. I certainly mean no disrespect, either to the current honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) or the former Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. Malcolm Fraser, by referring to that part of the Mallee once held by Mr Fraser as the other half. The representation of 2 1/2 seats in this House is now reduced to one and, sadly, such electoral redistributions are reducing the voice of rural Australians in the House. It means that those of us who are here on both sides of the House need to shout much louder.

        Mallee has enormous significance and yet still untapped potential. Its value is reflected in the diversity of its agriculture and its horticulture. These primary industries are complemented ably in Mallee by three magnificent provincial cities—Horsham, Mildura and Swan Hill—as well as 67 rural townships. All provide an opportunity for any variety of small business and employment in industry, manufacturing, processing, retailing and tourism. All of these small businesses exist in vital co-dependency with the rural industries that surround them.

        Much of what is produced in Mallee in food and fibre is exported. This serves what has to be Australia's area of greatest need these days—a dramatically accumulating trade deficit. Virtually anything can be grown in Mallee if it suits the harsh climate. Already it has a proven capacity to rise to such challenges as providing world's best practice, particularly in grain, especially in wine—including those wines that are enjoyed in this place—and wool. To these can be added dairying, many forms of horticulture, eggs, beef and poultry. As in most areas of Australia, Mallee offers the advantage that what is grown is good, clean food, free from the contaminants suffered by our competitors in the more densely populated Northern Hemisphere. I believe this is a marketing tactic we need to be much more clever at exploiting.

        Mallee, and other electorates like it in rural Australia, have the specific function of providing a substantial part of the export earning capacity of our nation to pay for the excessive appetite that we as Australians—particularly those in our capital cities—seem to have for consuming imported goods. Mallee has been performing—and I say this with an enormous amount of pride—for many years. Of the big ticket commodity items, it produces four per cent of the national wool clip, nine per cent of the nation's grain, one per cent of dairy produce, 79 per cent of dried vine fruit, 12 per cent of citrus, 15 per cent of wine, and a whole host of other commodities I wish there was time to mention. In total, this amounts to an export earning ability from Mallee alone in excess of $550 million per annum. To this can be added income from tourism and many other earning capacities, but that would have to be regarded as a significant contribution to the nation's wealth.

Those people would have arrived at the inland port of Mildura which, owing to the vision of the Chaffey brothers from California in the late 1800s, now presents the magnificent spectre of hundreds of square kilometres of irrigated vineyards and orchards—a sight to be seen—producing some of the world's best wines, dried fruit, citrus and vegetables.

They are now being forced to bear the brunt of an agenda in respect of the world trade scene. Taking on the rest of the world is very difficult when you are right on the margin, have trouble paying your rates, have to struggle to educate your kids—if in fact you can at all—and even put food on the table.

It extends all the way to the fertile Wimmera plains in the south—oceans of grain in the sun, a sight to see—producing the best hard wheat and the best malting barley. The growers there have demonstrated a willingness to survive by their own efforts. They have already diversified into other crops, demonstrating a versatility and an adaptability which should be the model for all Australians in these days of need for radical reform. This past season the growers were cheated of an opportunity to climb out of their financial difficulties by seasonal elements beyond their control; even the best farmers in the world have no control over the elements. It is an aspect of their activity that city dwellers need to better understand, because the grain industry also is in enormous difficulty.

Urgent action is needed to halt the alarming downward spiral of the price of wool. I believe that a strong message needs to be sent to the marketplace, a signal which says that we as Australians are prepared to stand behind that stockpile and finance it or, in some form, to remove it as an impediment to good and orderly marketing. I believe that sincerely.

        To be positive, Mallee provides an opportunity to achieve that missing link in our production chain, which is to value add not only to what is produced there, but also to what is produced in other places in our great nation. The proximity of ports in the south, the existence of a fine rail infrastructure which must be maintained and, in fact, enhanced offers openings for wool scouring and a starch industry out of the magnificent grain industry that already exists.

        The development of additional exotic industries such as goats, deer and ostriches has already been taken up and other interesting industries being researched include goat and sheep milk, but I think the greatest impediment to the sheep milk industry is convincing farmers to milk their sheep. Salt, which is the great scourge of the dry land of the Mallee and also of the river, must be regarded more as an asset than a liability and opportunity taken to use saline discharge for agroforestry.

        Until now the seat of Paterson has not existed since 1984. Research shows that initially it was named after colonial explorer and undoubted royalist and right wing establishment supporter, Lieutenant William Paterson. That seat was only ever held by the conservatives. However, the new seat of Paterson is said to be named after Banjo Paterson, the renowned balladist and republican who gave us

        Paterson is a very diverse electorate. Its southern border is the Hunter River. It extends up the coast past Port Stephens almost to Forster. In the north there are small rural towns of Dungog, Stroud, Bulahdelah and Gloucester. It contains the historic city of Maitland in the south-west. We have the largest aluminium smelter in the Southern Hemisphere at Tomago, and our local community is enriched by the many families at the RAAF base at Williamtown. We have a large oyster and fishing industry, strong beef, dairy and broiler industries; and of course a troubled timber industry.

        There is another and major initiative of this Government that I particularly welcome because of its significance for the residents of my electorate, and that is the decision to set up a portfolio for regional development. No electorate is a separate entity. The Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) will be well acquainted with my views not only on the needs of the electorate but also on just how we can address the long-term neglect from which the Hunter as a region has suffered. Since the first loads of coal and wood were shipped to Sydney in 1801, the Hunter has continued to provide much of this nation's wealth. It generates 85 per cent of New South Wales's electricity. It has the only rail lines that earn a profit in New South Wales, hauling coal down for export—of course, using diesel locos chewing up imported diesel fuel. We have a highly integrated metal industry. We are a major service centre. National Textiles at Rutherford is one of the most progressive textile plants in Australia, and of course the Hunter has the biggest earning port in Australia.

        Of course, the productivity of the Hunter has always been enhanced by the many successful small businesses using innovative and progressive methods. A good example is a Maitland margarine manufacturer, William Caine Pty Ltd. In 1986 this company was granted the first margarine production licence in 30 years. At that stage it employed four or five people. Today it has captured eight per cent of the national market. It is exporting margarine to New Zealand and it is looking to export margarine to Asia. It currently employs approximately 30 people and is growing. This country derives enormous wealth from the Hunter.

The Hunter must have a fair share of reinvestment from all levels of government.

        —Mr Speaker, to be a member of the House of Representatives is a privilege aspired to by many but accorded to comparatively few. I am conscious that it is a great honour that the electors of Tangney have chosen me as their representative.

        The House of Representatives has established traditions based on Westminster practices, but uniquely developed in this House over decades. Being aware of those traditions, I am also cognisant that they are not yet familiar to me. I have a great deal to learn and I am anxious to do just that. In those circumstances, I appreciate acutely the special privilege I enjoy in offering this speech from the dispatch box. I am delighted that my parents are able to be present and I acknowledge with gratitude the sacrifices that they made in my youth to ensure that I received the best upbringing and education then possible.

        I have arrived in this House having contested and won my seat as an endorsed candidate for the Liberal Party. In my perception, the Liberal Party is a broad based party having the advantage that it is not constrained by any ties to any external organisation. The central themes of liberalism for me are the notions of individual freedom and individual responsibility and the objective of equality of opportunity.

        Tangney, the electorate I represent, is an inner metropolitan electorate straddling the leafy southern suburbs of Perth. It is largely a residential area with some light industry. The northern boundary is formed by the southern sides of the Swan and Canning rivers. It is named after Dame Dorothy Tangney. Her career was detailed and the electorate was described as it then was in the maiden speech of my immediate predecessor, Mr Peter Shack. The warm welcome I have received from the residents of Tangney as their new representative has been humbling. I thank them and the many people whose efforts ensured my election.

        Tangney has sent four representatives to Canberra before me. Mr Peter Shack made a substantial contribution to public life over many years, a contribution which has not, in my view, been acknowledged adequately. Mention could be made of two other former representatives. Both occupy positions on the government front bench: one as Treasurer and the other as Assistant Treasurer. Despite being rejected by it, the latter, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), is so attached to the electorate of Tangney that he continues to reside in it. In fact, his residence is within a very short distance of my electorate office. I want to assure the Assistant Treasurer that if he, as one of my constituents, ever has any problem with the Federal Government or any of its instrumentalities, the services of my electorate office are available to assist him. This applies particularly to any difficulty he might encounter in his relationship with the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) or the Department of the Treasury.

        Mr Speaker, in giving the call to new members for the first time, just as you did with me, you have requested the House to extend the usual courtesies. This is a laudable practice which enables new members unfamiliar with the House and its ways to crawl before they are called upon to walk. The price exacted of a new member for the courtesies is that he or she is expected to be non-contentious. In the past week there have been some instances of new members accepting the courtesies and sailing close to the limits of non-contention. The non-contentious remarks of one new member caused a member of long standing to exercise his right to give a personal explanation in reply to criticism of him.

I will not complain if I am treated as if I am delivering a second speech rather than a maiden speech.

        The parliament is the crucible in which the essence of our democracy is distilled. The democracy, however, derives not only from the parliament.

        In the early 1970s I was employed by the Asian Development Bank and my wife and I lived in the Philippines, a nation then proud of its democracy established after the war. In September 1972 we had a vivid demonstration of the fragility of democracy. We woke on a Sunday morning to find that there was no newspaper. The radio, with its innumerable stations, was silent. The television ran no programs. We found the roads were almost empty. A policeman on a motorbike stopped our car. He was unable to explain to us what was happening, but did indicate there was a curfew. Later that day we learned that, having on Saturday night been living in a democracy with presidential elections approaching, we were now on Sunday living ostensibly under constitutional martial law with elections suspended. In fact, we were under a militarily backed dictatorship.

In many countries there was no suggestion of democracy; in a number there was war or insurgency. Even in those Asian countries with democratic governments substantially based on the Westminster system there were subtle differences from our system. Those subtle differences can determine whether there is a genuinely free democracy or one in which there is no defence to repression.

        An essential element of a true democracy, of our democracy, is an independent judiciary. I do not suggest that Australia's democratic system is presently under direct threat, but Australians should always be vigilant to ensure that any threat to the independence of our judiciary is firmly challenged. The independence involves freedom of the judiciary from the influence, by fear, favour or otherwise, of any agency and particularly the executive government. Essential to the independence of the judiciary is a strong, independent legal profession. The role and functioning of the legal profession continues as a subject of public discussion. In those discussions, the importance of the profession in the maintenance of the judicial system should be neither underestimated nor undermined.

        Intrinsic to the performance by this House of ensuring government is accountable to the people is the principle that no member should mislead the House. In a similar way, the efficient administration of justice depends on members of the legal profession as officers of the superior courts not misleading any court. In parliamentary elections, there is no equivalent obligation, and the opportunities for distortion and deception are abundant. In practical terms, the means of preventing dissemination of misleading information and the means of remedying the consequences of it are quite inadequate. This is particularly the case where those involved are not candidates or are not acting in the name of a political party. That, in my opinion, constitutes a significant potential threat to democracy. It is a matter, in my view, which warrants the attention of the Parliament.

        In responding to the proposed Address-in-Reply, I wish to refer to some specific matters. First, the Constitution of Australia provides for this to be a constitutional monarchy. The Government has no mandate from the electorate for a change from a constitutional monarchy to a republic. Australians can indicate their desire for such a change only by a referendum. Historically, Australians have shown themselves to be very reluctant to amend the Constitution. In those circumstances, it would be presumptuous for anybody to assume what would be the result of a referendum proposing that Australia should be a republic. It would be even more presumptuous to assert what sort of republic Australians would accept.

        The Opposition is committed to participating in the debate over whether Australia should become a republic and, if the answer is yes, what sort of republic Australia should become. It is essential that the public be informed fully as to what are the alternative forms of republic. It is also essential that there be a detailed analysis in the course of the public debate of the advantages and disadvantages of the alternatives—retention of the constitutional monarchy, variation of it or substitution of one of a number of possible forms of republic.

        It has not escaped attention that the Government appears to have embarked on a subtle campaign to remove visible references to and symbols of the monarchy. That campaign has extended to matters concerned with this Parliament. As I understand it, the proclamation of the Governor-General calling Parliament together has, since 1901, been in a time-honoured form. The proclamation has traditionally concluded with the words, `God save the Queen'. The proclamation calling this Parliament together omitted those words.

Just prior to this Parliament being opened, the form of oath and affirmation of office was changed. In consequence, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) took an oath of office different from that taken by other Ministers. Reference to the Queen was eliminated.

        Justice is administered in courts by judges and by judges and juries. Australians have a judiciary which is the equal of any in the common law world, and the public has great faith in the jury system. One of the strengths of the judiciary is that the judges exercise their responsibilities free from the influences of government and free from sectional and community influences. The function of a judge is largely to declare and apply the law. However, some decisions may be affected by the judge's personal view on a social issue. This may be true of juries also, but their deliberations are in private.

        From time to time, a judge sitting in court evinces an attitude which the community finds unacceptable. There have been notable instances recently where judges in sexual assault trials have made comments which many in the community, and particularly women, have found demeaning of women. I expressly refrain from commenting on any particular case. It is certainly disappointing if a judge reveals an attitude which is out of date or unenlightened or is out of step with general community views. It is more than disappointing if that attitude affects the outcome of a case before the judge, such that the outcome is perceived as unjust. I accept that many women in the community are concerned that some male judges have outdated attitudes on some social issues that do not adequately reflect the community viewpoint, particularly that of women.

        What should be done? It must not be forgotten that many decisions of judges are subject to appeal and an appellate court may correct a decision which reflects an inappropriate attitude on the part of a trial judge. That is not a complete solution. It is not for the Government to take steps to indoctrinate or re-educate judges. That would give rise to different and very serious concerns. It is for the judiciary itself to do something. In relation to gender bias awareness, the fact is that the judiciary has recognised that there is a need for something to be done. In the absence of detail in the Governor-General's speech, one could be forgiven for thinking that the proposed funding of the gender awareness programs for the judiciary was an initiative of the Government. It is not. The Government is responding to an initiative of the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration.

        The institute is a body independent of government, comprising a large number of judges, magistrates, lawyers—in private practice, in government practice and academics—and court administrators dedicated to the study and improvement of the system of administration of justice. In November 1992 the institute, having regard to the report of the task force of the National Committee on Violence Against Women, applied to the Government for funding for the development of a gender bias awareness program. The institute is an appropriate body to develop and to conduct such courses for the judiciary. On the basis that there is no government interference in the development conduct of any such courses, I expect the Opposition would in due course support the provision of funds by the Government to the institute for the project.

In his maiden speech, Gordon drew attention to the fact that Australia needed a national standard gauge network. He also drew attention to the fact that Australia needed a universal health system easily affordable, a quality system that would serve the working people of Australia. He also made reference, in his maiden speech, to the need for a government aircraft production facility in Australia, and I am pleased to say that it was Labor in government that delivered those things to him. The national standard gauge network, as part of the One Nation statement, will be routed through Geelong. The Government has instituted a Medicare system that is the envy of the world.

I would like to recount to honourable members an incident that occurred in the course of the campaign. We invited the living Labor legend, Big Gough, down to Corio to assist us in the campaign. It was a hot night, and we were all sweating pretty badly. The big fellow was mopping the back of the head like so. The city of Geelong West provided a small reception in the anteroom. After that was completed I suggested to Gough and Gordon that, before we went to the main dinner, we might like to go outside and walk up the side of the Geelong West Town Hall. We did that, to catch a bit of fresh air before we went into the main dinner.

We both stopped and he looked at Gordon and me; it was a poignant historical moment for me; and he said, `Well, Gordon, you and I will not have to worry about that.

It is an electorate rich in ethnic diversity. It also stretches from that central business district down along the Bellarine peninsula. In that central business district that I mentioned before is the city's great cultural assets.

        Many words have been spoken in recent times about the problems that the city of Geelong has had in the past. The Pyramid collapse sapped community confidence. Industry restructuring has meant that there has been significant labour shedding in the passenger motor vehicles industry and the textiles, clothing and footwear industry. There has also been a major impact upon the city with the general downturn in manufacturing. However, through all that, the great, resilient Geelong community has come through the pain and it now faces the future with a degree of optimism. It is a great place to live and a great place to be, and it is bristling with potential. Many people have asked what that potential is. I would suggest that, in the range of government programs that have been put in place, there are hints as to the areas in which the Geelong economy can grow over the next decades.

        Food and fibre processing will become increasingly significant. I would like to pay particular tribute to the Federal Government for the encouragement that it gave to BWK, the German wool scourer, to locate in the region. It will mean an extra 150 private sector jobs. There is great potential for job creation in the Geelong region through tourism—general tourism, eco-tourism, rural tourism and cultural tourism—utilising all the assets I have mentioned. There is great potential in the area for the export of services. I refer to engineering, construction and educational services. There is also potential for further growth in the public sector. Corio is relatively underdone when compared to other electorates around Australia in that regard. All in all, it is an exciting place to be and one which offers great potential.

I refer to the development of Geelong's small and medium business sector and the commercialisation of the new, innovative technologies that exist in the region. Exports from the Magnificent 700, identified by the Australian Manufacturing Council, will grow to $15 billion by 1997. My aim over the next three years will be to make sure that innovative Geelong businesses get a big slice of the action. Sorry, guys!

Competitive taxation arrangements, investment and export incentives will do much to stimulate that sector. The Government's recent initiatives to make the banking and finance sector more responsive to the needs of small and medium business, and to expand their lending to promising new ventures, is good news. However, there is more to be done. Conservative banks are still attempting to shore up losses incurred throughout the 1980s.

It has developed a revolutionary oil-emersed braking system which has quite staggering export potential. While the company has struggled to research and develop the product and to bring it to the commercialisation phase, it has encountered significant bureaucratic and financial institutional inertia that really leaves one wondering about the future of the clever country. While the bankers muse about the great potential of the product, it is their guidelines that restrict lending to commercialise the product.

        I would like to turn now to the area of regional development, an issue which has important ramifications for Geelong. I suggest that there is a role for the Commonwealth Government to play in stimulating the efficient use of national resources, as well as reducing the disparity in income levels and living standards between regions. National economic and welfare objectives cannot be fulfilled if key manufacturing regions such as Geelong are not performing to their potential. Market forces alone will not achieve the optimal spatial distribution of industry across the Australian economy.

        There are several compelling reasons why we need to seriously examine the regional development issue now. Firstly, the rapid pace of structural adjustment has left many regions with a diminished capacity to absorb displaced labour. Secondly, our major cities are becoming less attractive places to live. They have become economically inefficient, socially remote and polluted environments. In many regions the process of economic decline has been exacerbated by the process of tariff reform, adverse climatic conditions and declining commodity prices, which have served to reduce production, employment and income flows in local communities. In addition, the process of micro-economic reform has led to significant losses of public employment in smaller provincial towns that have no economic capacity to employ displaced skills. This rapid and serious decline in the economic base of regions threatens current and future investment in community assets such as housing and roads.

There is a need to develop a comprehensive policy framework for coordinating existing Commonwealth programs, for many initiatives in the food processing and tourism area, labour market and adjustment programs, assistance to exporters and rural economic programs impact significantly on regions. The policy framework that is being developed must allow sufficient flexibility to accommodate the different responses that are required to meet the unique problems and needs of differing regions. It must also coordinate in an effective way all the players in the game—local and State governments, regional development associations, the union movement, community organisations and private firms.

Also, an increasing regional identification has been encouraged by the growth of our trade with rapidly expanding Asian economies to our north. Just as the United Kingdom is seeking to carve out a deeper economic and political relationship with Europe, so must Australia seek to construct a more meaningful relationship with our northern neighbours. Just as the loyalty of the Queen of England will always be to her own subjects in the United Kingdom, so must we have in Australia a truly Australian head of state whose pre-eminent loyalty will be to the people of this nation.

        Wool and wheat in Grey are our traditional industries. To a large degree this reflects the double standards of Australia. Here we have the free market on the world market compared to the protected wage which can rarely, if ever, reflect the climatic or marketing fluctuations upon which it relies. I am puzzled by the barricade argument on wages when I see variations of factors of three, to five, to 10 in negative to positive incomes in my occupation. These traditional export earners enabled Australia to help pay its way in the world rather than be financed by the international bankers which now finance most of us as well as, of course, the wool industry itself. The rural adjustment scheme is lucky if it helps five per cent of farmers, offers no support for business, and will never be a substitute for effective economic policy.

        —Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon. Through you, may I offer my congratulations to my colleagues Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins and the Speaker. I also take this opportunity to congratulate my Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on his win at the 13 March election, thus affording the Australian Labor Party an unprecedented fifth term in government. As the Prime Minister took us through that campaign via

        Thus it is with great pride and humility that I rise in this place to offer this my maiden speech as a true believer of the 37th Parliament of Australia. This is a great moment of triumph for me. I have at last returned the seat of Bass to the Labor Party after its 18 years in the wilderness. The challenge to do so was offered to me at preselection in 1989. The task was a formidable one. However, my predecessor, Warwick Smith, underestimated my tenacity and firm belief that this Smith could win, and today a winner I am. My determination was immovable, although the obstacles were immense. My willingness to strive, my faith and often my pigheadedness kept me from wavering far from the ultimate goal of retrieving the seat of Bass.

        My local idol in Bass is Lance Barnard, a former Deputy Prime Minister of this great country. It was he who encouraged and helped me to shape the highway ahead. I made a solemn vow that I would work for three campaigns to get his seat back for the Labor Party. To Lance, if he could see me now, I would say, `Here it is, and by a mere 40 votes'. They say that life begins at 40. Well, here I am at the beginning of a long life in this place, I trust.

        My electorate is Bass. It was named after Dr George Bass, an early explorer who, in 1798, circumnavigated Tasmania—then known as Van Diemen's Land—in a small sloop, the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Norfolk
        </emphasis>
        . Bass Strait was named after him to honour this trip that put Tasmania firmly and well and truly on the map. George Bass was a keen student of nature. It was once said that he was the first man to bring a trained, scientific intelligence to bear upon the natural phenomena of this country. I ask that we heed those ideals today as we all work on both sides of this House to restore our environmental flora and fauna, somewhat similar perhaps to that which Dr Bass must have enjoyed 205 years ago.

        The Bass electorate came into being in 1903, and its first member of this House was David Storrer. During his first speech in this Parliament on 2 March 1904 Mr Storrer stated:

      <para>
       It seems that this man was well ahead in his thinking. Yet, almost 90 years later, we are still considering the possibility of one tier of government instead of what we now have, possibly an overgoverning of our people. Way back then David Storrer showed major concerns with the amount of commodities we were importing from foreign countries. He said that Australia in the early 1900s was intent on building up overseas industries and giving employment to their workers instead of affording encouragement and employment to the men and women of our own nation. Mayhap we should reflect a while on this thought as being once again perhaps relevant to today's import-export imbalance. His solution to partially avoid this imbalance in 1904 was to levy higher duties—today's tariffs—upon foreign goods imported, although I may add he did not suggest putting them on goods from Great Britain. Is this another suggestion from the past for us to heed?

        Until today, the Labor Party has held the seat of Bass on and off for 57 out of 90 years, with its most famous ALP members being Claude Barnard and his son Lance, my mentor. I look to serving the electorate of Bass beyond the turn of the century at the very least. Claude Barnard held the seat from 1934 to 1949. He was a locomotive engineman and, during his service in this place, chaired the Joint Committee on Social Security and was Minister for Repatriation. On leaving this place he was elected to the House of Assembly in Tasmania. His son Lance was elected in 1954 and served in many ministerial positions, including health, repatriation, primary industry, immigration, the interior, labour and national service, supply, Navy, Army and Defence, and went on to be Deputy Prime Minister from December 1972 until his retirement in June 1974. Lance was and is an extremely articulate gentleman and a wonderful person to model oneself upon. May I be half as good as he, and I will have achieved much. Today he continues to steadfastly work with our veterans with an immense knowledge and understanding of the problems they still face. I too will continue to make representation on their behalf.

        Bass is one of five electorates in Tasmania, and may I be parochial enough to say the most beautiful. It is a provincial one, covering approximately 7,254 square kilometres. It runs from Launceston in the south to Flinders Island in the north. Its major and only city is Launceston, my home town. Bass then wanders up the western side of the Tamar River to Legana and along the whole of the eastern river bank to George Town where the

The electorate then spreads up through the north-eastern rural sector taking in Lilydale, Gladstone, Scottsdale, Derby and Ringarooma, and offshore to Cape Barron and Clarke and Flinders Islands. Bass shares its boundaries with the sprawling electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams).

Then, in Launceston, we find the spectacular Cataract Gorge and the Cliff Grounds. On down the Tamar, we go to the glorious beaches and the bays of the northern coastline which extend from Low Head through Bridport and Weymouth along to Little Musselroe Bay, formerly called Lyme Regis. Products and industries of the area include farming, fishing, winemaking, textiles, aluminium and ferrous metals, wood, woodchips, timber, meat and vegetable production, boatbuilding, a brewery and tourism.

        From 1993 and beyond the Labor Government will continue these major reforms with a national training initiative to improve competencies for government buyers in the education process and research development. Quality assurance is another initiative aimed at promoting a more competitive industry. Rationalisation and amalgamation of our 300-plus trade unions into a more manageable structure of about 20 national unions will be a dramatic step but, in my estimate, an acknowledgment of a process of change towards unification and a stronger industrial base with which to expand and grow once again into a major world player.

        As the growing public debate has shown, the notion that Australia should become a republic is attracting a growing number of interested people. I have noted that in the speeches this evening. Just recently I attended an RSL dinner in Launceston where a majority appeared committed to a purely Australian identity—much to my surprise. There seemed to be a little hesitation, however, about major changes to the flag. It is also interesting to note that in 1977, when a coalition government conducted a national poll to choose a purely Australian national song, a total of 5,113,296 people chose either

        Mr Speaker, since Federation and since our coming to this part of the world in 1788 we have changed from a British, convict based nation to a diverse, multicultural nation, interlinked with an age-old indigenous race of people—our Aboriginals. It is time for our own identity. It is time for another beginning. It is time to be truly Australian. Let us look objectively at our Prime Minister's vision of the unification of Federal and State industrial relations, of reconciliation with our Aboriginal people, of a better way of life for all Australians, no matter from which corner of the globe they came.

        Another factor I would mention here is the Prime Minister's 1992 environment statement which identified sustainable management of water resources as a major issue of the 1990s. The $40 million initiative over four years will directly improve water quality in river and catchment areas around Australia. This initiative will allow governments and local communities to tackle key sources of pollution such as sewage plants and algal problems in the Murray-Darling basin in particular. In urban areas possible projects could be stormwater management and waste water disposal. The national landcare program is the most far-reaching program a federal government has ever undertaken and the Government is to be applauded for its initiative.

        Launceston is situated at the confluence of the Tamar and North and South Esk rivers and has a system of levees to protect the central business district and surrounding residential and industrial properties. The levees are founded on silt; thus settlement and subsidence have occurred which now requires major remedial works. Launceston has been lucky enough to get some of the assistance through landcare to the tune of $440,447. Major structural reforms of the underground systems have been ongoing for some years and this government assistance, through landcare, has helped. I am assured that many other places in Australia are being helped as well to sustain environmental protection.

        Mr Deputy Speaker, during the recent campaign in the lead-up to the federal election in March we flagged at every opportunity the devastating impact that unemployment was having on our society and, in particular, the electorate of Lyne. I noted with interest the absence of any positive proposals in the Governor-General's address to tackle our chronic, long-term unemployment problem which the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) has stated will rise to well over 400,000 in the next year. Nor was there any action plan to reduce our exploding foreign debt.The republican debate is not going to generate any jobs for my unemployed constituents.

        Historically, the regional economy in Lyne has been centred around primary industries such as dairying, beef, fishing and oyster farming, as well as the harvesting of natural resources such as timber. Although these industries are still important to the regional economy, the development of the tourism industry and the dramatic increase in the retired population, as well as widespread rationalisation of these rural industries, has seen a shift in the economic base of the region. An interesting example of that rationalisation and its effect on local employment is in the dairying industry. In the last 10 years in New South Wales the dairy industry has seen the number of dairy farmers fall by 40 per cent with the number of producing cows falling by 15 per cent, yet the amount of milk produced increasing by approximately 40 per cent.

        It is important to note here that my electorate of Lyne is changing dramatically. It was once considered a solely rural region, and although it still has a sound rural base it is now diversifying into a region with a strong industry and business component. My ambition for the electorate of Lyne is to see it become a strategic location for regional development. We already have a large cross-section of manufacturing industries of world standard which are earning export dollars for Australia within our region. They have recognised the potential of our stable labour market, the availability of ever improving infrastructure and our strategic location between the major cities of Sydney and Brisbane.

        It was with a great deal of interest that I learnt of the regional development strategy developed by the Country Mayors Association of New South Wales which is being launched in Sydney on 21 May this year. Also of interest was the funding of that scheme which was partly funded by the Department of Employment, Education and Training under the OLMA program. Giving credit where credit is due, the Government should be commended for the introduction of the OLMA program. There is not only that program which the Country Mayors Association has put together, but in my electorate of Lyne another very successful enterprise has been developed through this program which is a cooperative of herb and flower growers who are developing an export market for fresh flowers and orchids in the USA. These are the niche markets we must encourage our people to explore and get into.

        There are several important issues that I will be concentrating on during the life of this Parliament. I was very pleased to note that the Governor-General, in his opening speech, made mention of several issues that are of concern to not only me but the electors of Franklin. While I am mentioning the Governor-General, I note that opposition members have criticised the length of the speech. This amazes me as our vision can be encapsulated in 25 pages.

        The first issue I wish to mention is that of Aboriginal reconciliation with the wider community. Tasmania has had, and still has, a very sorry story concerning Aboriginal relations. I do not need to remind honourable members of past history. However, under the Groom Liberal Government we see no attempt at meaningful dialogue with the Aboriginal community to redress past dispossession and current disadvantage. Rather, it is turning the clock back by closing the Office of Aboriginal Affairs and rejecting a parliamentary Bill on land rights. I look forward to participating in the Keating Government's moves on lasting reconciliation and the development of an effective partnership between the indigenous people and the rest of the Australian community.

It is pleasing to note that under previous Labor governments tourism has emerged as a major contributor to economic growth throughout the country and has been instrumental in the provision of a great number of jobs, particularly for young Australians. As a Tasmanian member, ever mindful of the sensitive environmental nature of much of my electorate, it is pleasing to note that the Keating Government plans to work with industry to minimise tourism impacts on the environment through such measures as the national eco-tourism strategy and programs for forests and sites of natural significance.

        The last issue that I mention, which is very important to me, is that associated with long-term unemployment. Franklin, unfortunately, has some of the nation's highest levels of unemployment, areas associated with broadacre public housing development. The young people there now have some hope as, following the issues raised at the youth employment and training summit in Canberra last year, this Government has announced a national employment and training plan for young Australians. It is essential that the measures in this plan do deliver to young people the vocational education and training and employment experience that they so desperately need. Along with these measures, the excellent jobskills program needs further expansion to provide that much needed confidence and experience for those people entering the workplace after a long absence. I would like to pay tribute to those involved in the skillshare programs in my electorate—Key Training Centre, Huon skillshare and the Bridgewater-Gagebrook skillshare. These centres have provided thousands of unemployed with the opportunity to acquire the skills and training needed either to enter further training programs or, in many instances, part- and full-time employment.

        Today, at Question Time I asked a question of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about the purchase of an outstanding piece of real estate on the Gold Coast by a leading figure of Japanese organised crime, namely, Masaru Takumi. The Prime Minister seemed a little startled and surprised by my question and said that he was unaware of the subject matter of my question. I was a little surprised and startled by that response because this matter was in fact the lead front-page story in the Brisbane

They are the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), who is the junior Minister to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). I asked how this man who is second in charge of the largest Yakuza organisation in Japan—an organisation which has more than 37,000 members and which has an income in excess of $8 billion a year—could apparently visit Australia at will. I further asked how he could purchase real estate of this kind.

        by David Ross for most of the factual evidence—and it is straight, factual evidence. However, this is not the first time that the subject of the Yakuza's activities on the Gold Coast and the activities of leading members of the Yakuza, specifically the Yamaguchi-Gumi on the Gold Coast, has been raised publicly. Unfortunately, there seems to be an attitude that this is something that is either too hard for us or, `What does it matter? Let us hope it goes away'. I urge the Government and every member of this Parliament, regardless of political affiliation, to pay the closest possible urgent attention to what is happening with respect to movement into this country of organised crime, specifically Japanese organised crime.

        It is perhaps very instructive that, coincidentally, a book which purports to be a biography of J. Edgar Hoover is presently receiving much publicity. Only one week ago, a special documentary feature on the subject matter of the book was shown on Canberra television. I managed to see the second half of it after I had arrived in Canberra for the Parliament's sittings. Whether we accept the premise that J. Edgar Hoover was compromised by his sexual peccadillos into taking a public line on the Mafia, when advising the various Presidents of the United States and when responding to Senate and Congressional committees of inquiry, or whether we accept the premise that he was deliberating downplaying the activities of the Mafia in the United States because he was under pressure, maybe even blackmail, from the Mafia itself, the issue remains, indisputably, that as a result of the Federal Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States taking this line, the Mafia and organised crime got the most horrendous toehold in the United States of America at mind-boggling expense to that country in terms of damaged and destroyed lives and financial cost as well.

        We are a small country and in a sense relatively vulnerable. In another sense we are in a relatively good position. We do not have the history of narcotic addiction in this country which has given organised crime and its drug pedlars the base that it has in the United States. We also, because we are small, are a relatively open society and one relatively easy to `police' in terms of security operations. But I have to reiterate that the activities of the Yakuza in Australia have been publicly documented in our newspapers for some time. Nevertheless, it appears that no action has been taken by authorities, either State or Federal, which would have led to at least a reduction of the most blatant activities that we could imagine.

        My concern is, first and foremost, in the federal arena, but it overlaps into the State arena, particularly as it relates to matters pertaining to casinos. Without a doubt, organised crime is quite blatantly using Australian casinos to illegally launder huge sums of money. The casinos know, and they are not stopping it. For example, Jupiters Casino in Queensland, along with, I believe, all Australian casinos, is obliged under the law, to deny a person with a criminal background or history acess to the casino if it is aware that that person is gambling on the premises.

        That raises only one issue. There are a number of issues that I must cover. I come to a federal area. I refer to the question of how this man can get visas to visit this country  apparently at will.

        The questions have to be asked: what is happening in our post in Tokyo which allows these people to get visas?

        I should say here that, until recently, if people in Japan were convicted of criminal activities and served their term, the conviction was then expunged from the public record. Once they had `done their time' there was no further record of it. To talk about the criminal records of Japanese individuals can be misleading because there may be information beyond that which now appears on the public record. Persons who have come to this country without declaring their criminal records and who have subsequently been detected have been deported, but others cannot be deported on that basis. They could, however, be denied visas. I ask: what is happening in immigration that these people can come here in the way that they do?

        The second matter that I wish to raise is to ask what the Foreign Investment Review Board is up to. As I understand it, there are three bases on which a foreign national can purchase residential property in Australia, such as the property Mr Takumi—or Takumi, since I will not dignify him with the title of `Mr'—has purchased in my electorate. As the Prime Minister said earlier today in part answer to my question at Question Time, people can purchase units off the plan—in other words, new units.

This particular property has been bought by Takumi. There is no question of the property qualifying on the basis of being purchased off the plan.

        A residence may also be purchased by a company for the purpose of providing accommodation for a senior executive who is moving to Australia to take up a position with the company.

         To return to the matter of being a senior executive in a company, the facts show that the penthouse in question has been purchased by a $2 company called Takumi Enterprises Pty Ltd. No-one is even being shy about the name of the person involved in the transaction. It is a $2 company, in which the shareholders are Takumi and his wife, and the board of directors is made up of three persons: Takumi, his daughter and a Queensland solicitor. I do not know the name of the solicitor at this stage but, for various reasons, I suspect that will become public knowledge in due course.

Certainly members of the Federal Police are fully aware of Takumi, all his visits and his activities on the Gold Coast—at least, they claim they are. Why are the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Foreign Investment Review Board not informed by the AFP of its surveillance of Takumi's activities and of what is going on?

        Let me inform the House of the sort of business that this crowd is into in Japan. On the latest count, organised crime in Japan owns 4,276 money lenders, 571 real estate companies, 1,331 coffee shops, 2,291 restaurants, 2,156 construction companies, 4,616 snack bars, and 2,159 strip joints, steam baths and nude studios. Since the introduction of anti-gang laws in Japan, organised crime has been corporatising, trying to dress up its activities in corporate gear. Since those laws were introduced—laws which were meant to wipe out organised crime in Japan—the syndicate to which I have referred went on to establish 75 corporations in Japan, ranging from real estate firms to an aerobics school and a children's clothing shop.

If the amount involved can be kept under a million—or whatever the figure is; it is not precisely $1 million—then organised crime will know that we are here for the taking. And why not? The number of Japanese tourists coming to Australia, specifically to the Gold Coast, and the very large number of Japanese and Koreans settling as permanent residents on the Gold Coast and in Sydney, become the prime targets. Of course, the syndicates I have mentioned will go to those places.

I want to know what sort of surveillance the Treasury and the AFP have of telegraphic transfers to casinos. Surely this must come under the purview of financial transactions reporting—I do not know; I do not have expert advice on that.

Small towns are now facing many changes, and I will be seeking to build on their importance as centres for their communities, both socially and economically. The electorate of Lyons is not an easy electorate of which to be the member. It is big, ranging from the north to the south of the State and from the west coast to the east coast. Lyons makes up 61 per cent of the land mass of Tasmania. It touches all the other electorates—Braddon, Bass, Franklin and Denison—three of which, together with Lyons, now contain Federal Labor representatives.

        The industries in Lyons include forestry, mining, farming, fishing and tourism. They all make a great wealth generator for Tasmania and its people. In its early days of development, Tasmania was the food basket for Australia. It was one of the first to develop the wheat and sheep industries, and it supported much of the mainland for many of the convict years. It has always played a prominent role in the rural economy, and today the seat of Lyons proudly carries on that tradition.

        According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Tasmania's contribution to foreign trade for the 12 months ending June 1992 was valued at $1.5 billion in round terms. That is a considerable amount of money. The main categories in which the major proportion of this falls includes food and live animals to the value of $298 million; materials such as pulp and paper waste, crude fertilisers, processed ore and metal scrap and textile fibres to the value of $303.3 million; manufactured goods including leather, paper, paper board, pulp, textile yarn, iron and steel metals, $30 million; chemicals and related industries including organic and inorganic chemicals, dyeing and tanning, medicinal and essential oils and fertilisers, $476 million; specialist manufactured items such as furniture, travel goods, footwear, scientific instruments, et cetera, $98 million.

        There has been much concern over the forest and mining industries in our State for some time, and some with good reason. Many of those concerns in the broader community of Tasmania are being overcome with improved forest practices and better mining practices and the national forest strategy, which I hope the Tasmanian Government will soon sign. In the long term, I would like to see another pulp mill that will assist the growth of export dollars for our trade figures. The action of some forestry companies, and the way they wish to restructure their operations, adds to the distrust of some Tasmanians towards some forest based industries.

It has gone about a restructuring process that would equal any industry that has been restructured in Australia. Although it has reduced its work force considerably, the honesty of the capital and of the labour working in that mill has proved capable of working through the difficulties of restructuring so that the mill will continue to operate in a profitable way within Tasmania.

        There are a number of important issues facing the future of the electorate. The wool industry has fallen into a hole, and there are many reasons for that. The superfine that was grown in my electorate—I guess there is a lot less being grown now—used to set record world prices. I certainly hope that will be the case again. But there is no simple solution to the wool crisis. We have been locked into the world milling market for too long, and we have not developed the products of the woollen industry. We have just concentrated on a commodity at the farm gate—a raw product. We have to be thinking about the product that the consumer wants. For too long the cocktail circuits of New York, Paris and Tokyo may have been the major incentives for those trying to sell Australian wool.

        Having travelled to Scotland some years ago and looking over the Isle of Harris at some of the roughest sheep in the world and some of the strongest wool, I marvelled at why Australia does not have a Cressy tweed or Campbell Town worsted, as the world knows Harris tweed. Several of the caps that I wear are Donegal tweed from Ireland. Why have we not been able to match those world marketing names with our superfine wool? Why has the Australian woolmark not achieved the same success as Tasmanian salmon and King Island cheese? It leaves me a little bewildered.

         The ultimate action upon these specific allegations is commendable, but ongoing concerns must and do remain about the administration of DEET.

In particular, I wish to pursue the issue of the awarding of consultancies by DEET to former departmental officers. Before going to the finer points of this issue, I would draw to the attention of the House the guidelines on acceptance of business appointments on retirement or resignation issued by what was then the Commonwealth Public Service Board on 16 April 1987. Subsequently these guidelines were distributed on 25 May 1987 within the former Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, now DEET, to all deputy secretaries, division heads, State and Territory directors and other senior officers. The guidelines were later slightly amended and reissued in DEET, as a reminder to staff in June 1988 and again on 18 September 1992, as an official conduct statement.

         The purpose in mentioning certain of the guidelines at some length is that they have special relevance to the consultancy and training work undertaken for DEET by Moreland Group Training Technologies Pty Ltd and Groundwork Development Pty Ltd, which are located in Melbourne. It is significant that the manager of the Moreland group is Mr Tom Gibson, who is also associated with Groundwork Development. Immediately prior to working with Moreland, Mr Gibson was head of the programs division of DEET from 1 April 1987 until 6 July 1990, as indicated in the answer of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) to my question on notice No. 1571 in the last Parliament. This same answer tells us that Mr Gibson also acted as State director of DEET in Victoria from 19 December 1988 to 24 February 1989, 26 June 1989 to 7 July 1989 and 30 November 1989 to 18 May 1990. Moreover, the answer confirms that, as head of the programs division, Mr Gibson was responsible for Aboriginal programs, Aboriginal training, industry training and Training Services Australia, TSA, in Victoria.

         Of further interest in the Minister's answer to my question No. 1571 is the information that Mr Gibson played a key role in the promotion or transfer of key DEET officers in the training area. Mr Gibson was a member of the selection advisory committee which recommended the promotion of Mr Deny Martin to the position of assistant director, industry training, senior officer grade B. He chaired the committee which recommended the transfer of Mr Andrew Jackomos to the position of assistant director, Aboriginal programs branch, senior officer grade B; and, in consultation with the then State director, Victoria, he recommended the transfer of Mr Ray Levingston to the position of assistant director, training services Australia, senior officer grade B.

         Mr Andrew Jackomos later transferred from DEET to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, ATSIC, on 1 July 1992 as part of the transfer of the community element of the training of Aboriginals program, TAP, to ATSIC. This fact comes from the response of the then Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to my question on notice No. 2003. This same response points out that Mr Jackomos was promoted to the position of State manager for ATSIC in Victoria on 7 December 1992.

         The full implications of Mr Gibson's influence in the bureaucratic advancement of these officers will become apparent as I now proceed to deal with the work awarded by DEET and ATSIC to the companies with which he is involved. Before embarking on this analysis, it is worth noting that working with Moreland in much of this work has been Mr Iain Polley, another former officer of DEET. According to the Minister's answer to my question No. 1571, the Moreland group and Groundwork Development were paid a total of $280,679.37, from March 1990 to when the Minister provided his answer to me on 23 December 1992, for some 20 training and consultancy packages. Payments for 15 of these packages are detailed in the DEET annual reports of 1989-90, 1990-91 and 1991-92 totalling $166,760.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Presumably the discrepancy in total amounts arises from the fact that some payments were outside the periods covered by the three annual reports referred to, or there is some discrepancy between what was put in the annual reports and what the Minister was told by his department. The principal concern, however, is in the ballooning of payments from the time Mr Gibson joined the Moreland group after leaving DEET on 6 July 1990. In the 1989-90 annual report only $15,200 was reported as being paid to the Moreland group, yet this tripled to $45,840 in the 1990-91 report and had gone up sevenfold to $105,715 by the 1991-92 report. It is difficult to believe that the Moreland group had become so dramatically improved after Mr Gibson joined it from DEET, that DEET officers felt compelled to push such substantial extra work its way.

         This question becomes more intriguing when we look at that part of the Minister's answer to my question No. 1571, which states that none of the officers over whose promotion or transfer Mr Gibson had influence, exercised any delegation in respect of the payments made to the Moreland group. Such an answer does not fit with the departmental documentation over this period in relation to approvals for payment to the Moreland group for a number of the packages it provided through DEET.

         Mr Ray Levingston, who Mr Gibson recommended be transferred to the position of assistant director, Training Services Australia, and who later became director, TSA, approved payments to Moreland as follows: on 3 July 1990, payment of $2,998.65 being two-thirds of the proceeds of a workshop run from 12 to 14 June jointly by Moreland and TSA; on 27 August 1990, payment of $1,800 for a share of proceeds from a metropolitan fire brigade program held in mid-year; on 23 October 1990, $1,600 for trainer training programs run just prior to payment; on 8 November 1990, $4,125 for a training techniques program held from 29 October to 2 November; on 18 October 1991, $1,600 for a two-day course run on 12 to 13 September; on 8 November 1991, a further $4,500 for a training needs analysis; and, finally, on 6 April 1992, $1,650 for trainer training conducted during 5 to 14 February.

         Apart from approving payment to Moreland in these instances, Mr Levingston was, of course, instrumental in actively arranging for Moreland to provide certain of these and other packages for or through DEET.

         The contract that really takes the cake, though, is the engagement of the Moreland group on 23 November 1989 through DEET on behalf of the Victorian Aboriginal Employment Development Policy Coordinating Committee, to undertake a study of the training needs of the Aboriginal field staff of the AEDP agencies. A minute signed by Lesley Hale, Deputy State Director of DEET on 26 May 1992, further says of this contract:

        This is just over seven months prior to Mr Gibson quitting DEET for private training. Strangely, the amount of $2,500 for Moreland is shown in the DEET annual report for 1989-90, but for a different purpose. Moreover, who on 15 April 1992 is paid an amount of $4,350 and a further amount of $3,800 for consultancy work with the Aboriginal community arising out of the contract just referred to? Thanks to a departmental fax sent by Mr Andrew Jackomos on 10 June 1992 we know it was Mr Tom Gibson through his company, Groundwork Development. It really has to be said that Mr Gibson's record before and after leaving DEET has given a whole new meaning to the phrase `providing for your own future'.

         Of special interest also must be the consultancy awarded to Moreland through DEET for the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. There was no public tender for this major consultancy as the work involved was likely to be below the tender threshold of $30,000. However, the eventual payment to Moreland was $41,746.30, as indicated in the Minister's response to my question No. 1571, which is well over the tender threshold.

         The selection of Moreland was recommended in a minute signed by Mr Bill Bowron, Assistant Secretary, Aboriginal Community Development Branch, on 21 October 1991. Mr Bowron, it should be noted, was also the author of the June 1988 official conduct statement. Moreland was chosen from three so-called firms of consultants, the other two being Mr John Stewart, a Sydney management consultant, and Jada Business Services of Cleveland in Queensland. I understand that Mr Stewart is a former director of Training Services Australia in the New South Wales State office of DEET. Good old DEET again!

        This frankly strikes me as a very loose basis upon which to recommend a major consultancy which turns out to be $12,000 over the public tender threshold. The Moreland group and Groundwork Development have as well done well out of work for ATSIC, with Mr Polley and Mr Gibson heavily involved in much of the work undertaken. As shown in the answer of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) to my question on notice No. 2003, contracts for Moreland go back to October 1989. Most of the work given by ATSIC to both Moreland and Groundwork in terms of value and volume has, however, been in 1991 and 1992.

         All of this may well be a wonderful coincidence of events in the Aboriginal training area out of which Moreland and Groundwork have derived a significant benefit, or maybe they provide a service of especially high competence. On the matter of competence I would have to say—and I am able to speak as a former professional trainer in both the public and private sectors—that certain compelling questions arise out of at least one major project undertaken by Moreland. I refer to the Moreland group report entitled

         Apart from the vagueness of many of the report's assertions and the absence of such a basic element as a bibliography, it makes among its 10 recommendations a distinctly peculiar one. Recommendation No. 2 states:

        I do not quarrel with the notion that DEET officers should be trained to be more sensitive to all groups in the community, but how many languages are they expected to have a working command of phrases in? The proposed phrase book also presupposes very poor knowledge of what constitutes survival linguistic skills. More to the point, why are DEET officers expected to know Aboriginal phrases when only 40,000 of Australia's 200,000 Aborigines speak traditional or indigenous Aboriginal languages? We are, after all, talking about the operational practicalities of the day to day running of a Federal department.

         The awarding of contracts of any form by Federal departments must at all times be and be seen to be totally above reproach, but even more so in respect of consultancies awarded by a department to its own former officers. Accordingly, I call upon the Minister for Employment, Education and Training to immediately investigate whether the relationship between the Commonwealth and the Moreland group and Groundwork is in any way in breach of the official conduct guidelines for the acceptance of business appointments on retirement or resignation.

         Such an inquiry, I would suggest, should closely examine four points: first, whether those officers who authorised payment on approved consultancies had the proper authority and delegation; second, whether they, their relatives or friends profited or gained a benefit by the grant of consultancies; third whether they, their relatives or friends worked with the Moreland group or Groundwork Development at any time; and, four, whether Mr Tom Gibson was made an offer of partnership or employment with the Moreland group and Groundwork Development because he could deliver consultancies, having promoted or transferred the appropriate people within DEET. In demanding an inquiry I point out that as a DEET officer, Mr Tom Gibson was handed the official conduct guidelines on 25 May 1987 and subsequently sighted and signed them. Finally, I seek leave to table the various documents I have referred to throughout my speech on these appropriations.

It has, however, hung onto a policy that was equally rejected by the electorate, and that is its entirely unpalatable industrial relations policy. It is the area of industrial relations that exemplifies how un-Australian the Opposition's policies are. Basically, it is an imported product from New Zealand, I guess with a bit of American seasoning. Australians did not want individual employment contracts imposed on them.

The Opposition is also saying that the Government's treatment of shares is wrong and so on.

         We believe the social security system is basically a needs based system which is there to help those people who need it. The savings, which could be as high as $80 million for an initial setting up cost of some $350,000, have allowed the Government as and from 1 April 1993 to extend the fringe benefits to everyone who has a part or full pension. I know from talking to the many thousands of age pensioners and pensioners generally throughout the country that they place a very high value on those fringe benefits.

         Some three per cent of pensioners have money to invest in shares, in many cases simply to circumvent the income tax test. If it means that they have to be brought back to the same situation as other managed investments in order to find the appropriate funds in these tough economic times to extend fringe benefits to everybody, that is not a high price to pay. I look forward to the debate coming to this House so that we can talk about this matter at greater length. I can assure the Opposition that this is something which the Government supports very strongly. The Opposition supported it. I cannot see why those opposite should suddenly change their minds, but that is something we will examine later.

         Dignity is terribly important for older Australians. Older Australians do not want to have to rely on others all the time—they want to do some things for themselves and at their own pace.

People, whose hands may not be as strong and dexterous as they used to be, find it very difficult opening certain items that they buy from the supermarket. Difficulty with packaging is a widespread problem. Some of the items that are commonly complained about include bottles of food products, cereal packets, most items packed in plastic, and cleaning items.

If we here, and those in industry, can do something to alleviate the problems that older Australians experience, we as a nation are only living up to the standard that has already been set by this Government—a standard of caring and compassion for senior citizens of this country.

Moneys from these Bills are needed to continue the highly successful community development employment projects within Aboriginal communities, to fund the National Railways Commission, to fund the transfer to the States of the repatriation general hospitals, and to fund an equity contribution to the AOTC. I, look forward—as I am sure do all colleagues on this side of the House—to the challenges of the next three years of government; continuing the reforming policies that are the trademark of the Labor Party and the reason for our success.

         A number of observations, however, about the new home of the Parliament are in order. The new House is impressive—cleverly designed and incorporating many unique features. The 22 kilometres of corridors, however, are enough to render the gymnasium redundant. Sadly, the colours throughout the building, particularly in the two chambers, seem faded. Their pale, insipid and washed-out appearance is a parody of the rich and vivid green and red tonings of the former House of Representatives and Senate chambers. One can only hope that when refurbishment is required this mistake will be rectified.

The member who now gets the call is in fact the second speaker to this Bill, the first having been the Minister for Finance, who gave the second reading speech. Therefore, when a member of the Opposition rises for the call he must be given precedence over a Government member.

         I have listened to some cant, hypocrisy and an enormous amount of nonsense in this place today from members of the Opposition. One wonders whether in the last election they even bothered to talk to the ordinary men and women of Australia out in the electorate. Did they honestly believe that they could fool ordinary Australian voters and that the creation they called Fightback—what a name!—had any relevance to their desires, their wishes and their concerns about the long-term future of this country?

         Did the Opposition honestly believe that its continued attack on Medicare was going to be accepted by the Australian people? Did the Opposition honestly believe that, after the failures of the Fraser Government and continued attempts to destroy the best and fairest health care system this country has ever seen—a system which people come from around the world to look at in order to find out how to make a fair and careful health system—people were going to buy the cant and total hypocrisy that the Opposition put before them at the beginning of this year? Well, they did not accept that cant or hypocrisy and they passed the Opposition a message which apparently it still has not learnt.

         Even before the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) started on his hidden agenda, Labor stands condemned for its deceit. Attempts to remove the Crown are a legal minefield and would be a happy hunting ground for my fellow lawyers. Labor aims to undermine our Constitution. What will happen? Can Australia survive as one nation? Are the States to go? Would the Prime Minister choose the President? Would he become both President and Prime Minister? A horrible thought. Would conventions preventing the Governor-General from exercising his reserve powers restrain a president of the banana republic of Australia using the letter of his authority to the fullest extent?

Some honourable members present would recall that I have represented both the Liberal Party and the National Party, and represented both well. I am possibly the first member to be so privileged, although there was a period of almost six years of involuntary absence between my two periods of service. I have held positions at the State executive level in both the Liberal Party and the National Party and thus have a close understanding of both parties. The most notable characteristic deserving comment is the overwhelming similarity between the rank and file membership. Both comprise dedicated supporters of free enterprise. Branch meetings are almost identical, attended by usually small groups of highly motivated people, and they discuss the same areas of mutual concern. If one did not know the individuals, it would not be an easy task to identify the party attended.

         Along with Doug Anthony, in my electorate Liberal-National Party members and supporters feel that our continued existence as two separate organisations is a luxury we can no longer afford. Amalgamation is seen as necessary to maximise our slender resources and to direct full attention to our real political opponents—the Labor Party. My colleague the National candidate also flagged merger prospects following the election result in Fisher. I must say that I agree with him. Like others in the community, I was disappointed that at this stage the National Party has refused to even discuss amalgamation. A successful merger could well be the only way to federal government and, after five successive losses, it must be considered. Like Australia, as Liberals and Nationals we cannot go on the way we are.

That was the Minister for Finance, who introduced the Bill. As I understand it, the advice that was given to you previously and the ruling you gave was that because the member—in this case the honourable member for Higgins, who actually moved that the debate be adjourned after the second reading speech of the Minister—was not here the Opposition forfeited its right of first call for the first speaker after the second reading speech of the Minister. That, Mr Deputy Speaker, is an unprecedented ruling. It is the practice of this Parliament that whichever shadow Minister of the Opposition is on duty here at the table when the second reading is finished will move the motion for the debate to be adjourned.

          I have seen many occasions on guillotines where opposition members have sought the call in the way that the honourable member for Fisher has. Of course, they always get the call because that opposition member seeking the call is the first one to speak on that Bill. Under a convention, we have had a cognate debate on a number of Bills, but in fact we have been debating only one Bill. You will see that the amendment that we have debated cognately appears in the

         —The Mabo decision does nothing to improve relations between Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals. The judgment of the High Court of Australia has discouraged investment in a whole range of areas—in the pastoral industry and in mining and tourism—and concern is continuing to mount. The impact on our economy will be devastating. While some say that the Mabo decision was a narrow one, based on its particular facts, and that the only land caught in the net will be certain isolated parts of the nation, this has not been proven. Even if that view is currently correct, uncertainty remains for the court may, at any time, expand the extent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander title. Indeed, much of Australia could ultimately be trapped.

         Most agree that the full ramifications of Mabo are unclear. The Government itself has promised to fund, at our expense, a number of cases to test its limits. Negotiation has been suggested, but this will not resolve the legal mire. The last thing Australia needs is the year in, year out debilitating effect of protracted litigation. We would never really know the final extent of Mabo because the next case would be just around the corner. Racial harmony, jobs, including Aboriginal jobs, investment and economic recovery would all be casualties.

         There have been calls for legislation to bring certainty back into the land law. Industry groups, prospective overseas investors, both sides of politics, the Queensland Labor Premier and Aboriginal people themselves have all canvassed this possibility.

         The most clear, decisive and desirable action would be complementary State and Federal legislation to reverse Mabo. Alternatively, the Federal Parliament could amend its own laws, where they have contributed to the ability of the court to find in favour of Mabo. This would not be an approach inconsistent with the concept of land rights, as the States could then deal with this issue in accordance with their own laws and values. While the Parliament would have then seized the initiative to break the deadlock, boosting stability, investment and jobs, we, as members of Parliament, are at least accountable at every election to the community for our actions. Unfortunately, the unelected politicians of the High Court are accountable to no-one.
