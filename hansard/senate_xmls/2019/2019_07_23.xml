                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen, finally, the issue of this toothless, useless ministerial code of conduct getting some attention. I'm pleased that yesterday this chamber agreed to establish an inquiry to look into two incidents of former ministers clearly—in my view—breaching those standards. I was disappointed that it didn't get support to actually look at how we make those standards enforceable and hold both former and current ministers to account to comply with them. But it is linked to today's issue. We've seen a series of investigations that have revealed highly inappropriate meetings between the current Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Mr Taylor, and the then Minister for the Environment and Energy, and still a minister, Mr Frydenberg, over the issue of whether or not a critically endangered grassland could have its environmental protection removed so that Minister Taylor and a company that he and his family control could conduct land clearing with impunity and not need to comply with federal environmental laws. There are clear provisions in the ministerial standards that go to not using personal information for personal use and to not having personal conflicts of interest, not using one's position as a cabinet minister to try to feather one's own nest financially. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We sought an explanation of what was revealed by the very detailed investigations by <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian </span>publication. I feel entirely unsatisfied by the so-called explanation just given by Minister Cormann, who simply says that the minister has disclosed his interests. Well, that's not at question. What is at question is whether or not pressure was placed by Minister Taylor onto the then environment minister, Mr Frydenberg, in breach of the ministerial code, in breach of that rule that you are not meant to put your personal interests ahead of your job as a minister who is meant to be acting for the betterment of Australians. I think that explanation was completely shoddy. Frankly, we stand vindicated. This is exactly why we wanted the inquiry to look into this issue. I had a very low level of expectation of how much of an explanation we'd get today, and I'm sad that I haven't been disappointed in that regard. You can't just brush off noncompliance with the ministerial standards. An allegation of breach is a very serious thing that I would have thought the government would want to go to great pains to disavow if the evidence was there. Just to say that there's nothing to see here will not restore the confidence of the Australian people in the conduct of these ministers. Is it any wonder that members of the public think that politicians are just here for their own benefit and here to feather their own nest when we see constant either actual or, at the very least, perceptions of breaches of these ministerial standards?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is long past time that these standards were given some enforceability and were complied with not just by former ministers who've now left and want to get paid for selling the knowledge that they gained as ministers—and we're going to be looking into that thanks to the inquiry yesterday—but by existing ministers who actually take these standards seriously. Maybe they would if the Prime Minister asked them to take these standards seriously. The status of this document is the Prime Minister's code of conduct for his ministers. This is really on the head of the Prime Minister, who is clearly turning a blind eye repeatedly to these constant breaches or, at the very least, snubs of these standards. We need these standards to be enforced, we need them to be complied with and we certainly need the cooling-off period extended from not just 18 months, which gets routinely ignored anyway, to a decent five-year chunk. We need independent enforcement of these standards.</span>

We have been pushing for that for 10 years now. It is getting boring to keep saying, 'We have been pushing for this, we need it; look at all of the examples,' but we're not going to stop, and I'm grateful that we have at least some company in that regard. Where is your proposal for an ICAC? There was much talk of this late last year. Pre-election you wanted to look like you were doing something in this space and so hastily announced a body with very weak powers that was broadly criticised by experts as totally inadequate, but we haven't even any movement on that totally inadequate proposal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The consistent denial and failure to apply basic standards will serve only to reduce the public's confidence in this whole institution. I don't care if the public think the government are terrible; I think they're terrible. When they do have an agenda it is awful, makes people's lives harder and wrecks the planet. But I do think that people's level of confidence in the institutions of our democracy is important and that we all have an obligation beyond our party political views to try to uphold those high standards and to do what's best to comply with those rules.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As it stands we have a very inadequate explanation by Minister Cormann for this whole debacle that has been revealed and has rolled out over several months now. We, sadly, had the chamber yesterday refuse to look into this example and we also had the chamber refuse to actually look into why the code is so useless and how it can be fixed and made more enforceable. We're not going to give up on this. If you think that you can get away with putting your own private interests and those of your family business first and trying to exert influence to weaken environmental laws, you've got another think coming.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to this chamber continuing to pressure the government and Ministers Taylor and Frydenberg for an actual explanation of what on earth is going on here and how they can possibly justify a sitting minister requesting a meeting with an environment minister to ask whether or not an endangered grassland listing can be weakened or modified so that that minister's private family company can make more money off a private enterprise. I cannot believe that nobody else thinks that's outrageous and that it doesn't warrant investigation by a Senate committee. We will move for that again after the completely useless explanation that we got from Minister Cormann today. He didn't address any of those issues. They are valid and important issues that should be addressed and I will urge my colleagues to rethink whether or not we look at this further because, clearly, there is something fishy going on here and the public are sick of it. We're sick of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ministers shouldn't be able to put their own personal financial interests ahead of the interests of Australians and they shouldn't be able to get away with trying to do it behind closed doors and putting departmental officials in very awkward positions. The reporting is that one of the senior officials of the environment department was invited into one of these meetings. It turns out that that same person was responsible for a compliance action for enforcing an illegal clearing investigation against that same company. What kind of pernicious position is this to put that unbiased and very professional public servant in—to have them in the room when someone was trying to exert undue influence on both the responsible minister and that public servant themselves?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not going to take our foot off the pedal on this one, and I hope we will have a similar level of concern to what was expressed yesterday in relation to former Ministers Pyne and Bishop taking jobs and looking like they were taking dodgy advantage of the knowledge they gained as ministers. I think we should still have that same level of scrutiny on existing ministers. If these standards are completely useless, just throw them out and give up on the charade of them meaning anything.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's make sure that all MPs are subject to appropriate standards. This shouldn't just be about scoring points from the other side, and I fear that's what yesterday was about. We actually need to make sure that these standards are complied with, whoever is in government, and that people in this place are not putting their own personal interests ahead of their interest in doing a proper job. Surely that is the very least that the Australian public can expect of all of us.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:10</span>):  I rise to take note of the explanation. This is becoming something of a regular occurrence, unfortunately, in the early days of this parliament: Minister Cormann being forced to explain in this chamber the actions of his colleagues. Every time it's the same story. Whether it's Minister Taylor, Minister Frydenberg, former Minister Pyne or former Minister Bishop, we get the same thing: we get a carefully crafted statement that dodges real questions, provides no real answers and doesn't engage in any meaningful way with the allegations at hand, which are serious allegations. We get statements that smooth over the glaring inconsistencies in the protagonists' stories. Today we didn't even really get that. We got a glib dismissal—a handful of words from the leader of the government in this place—of the issues as a whole.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can understand why the Prime Minister and his representative might want to protect two of the most senior ministers. It's politics and it's a political move, but I tell you what: it has real costs. Under each of its successive prime ministers, this Liberal government has overseen a lessening of the standards applicable in public life. They have a tendency to see all rules and all regulations as red tape, to be abolished if possible or evaded if not. It shows itself in their attitude towards the environment, but it also shows itself in their response to the ministerial standards. Those standards are not just there for decoration. They exist to build public trust that the actions taken by elected representatives are for the public interest and not directed towards private ends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This episode looks like the absolute worst of what people fear about this government: insiders using a privileged position to help themselves and their families, and ministers using their considerable power for what appears to be personal gain. These are questions that ought to have been answered in the statement that was provided this morning, and they were not even engaged with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no court that enforces the ministerial standards. It is ultimately up to the Prime Minister to decide what kind of government he wishes to lead. Mr Morrison this week has been all about the tests. He set a whole lot of tests for the Labor Party. Well, this is a pretty big test for the Prime Minister, and today he's failed it, because, in allowing his representative in this place to make the statement he made this morning, he's made it clear that he is not interested in oversight, he is not interested in accountability, he is not interested in providing transparency and he has no respect for process. The Australian people deserve a great deal more than this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning was an opportunity to put some facts on the record from the government's perspective. What's been reported in the public domain and what's come out through the FOI process that's been undertaken by journalists is truly troubling. The emails revealed under the FOI process reveal a remarkable set of coincidences. Minister Taylor, it appears, sought to contact his colleague Mr Frydenberg, who in turn sought a briefing from the Department of the Environment and Energy about the decision to upgrade environmental protections for certain native grasslands in New South Wales. That briefing was sought the day after the department met with Jam Land, a company, to talk to them about compliance issues. What's asserted in the media is that this property is a Taylor family property. The media reports state that the property was owned by a company with strong ties to Minister Taylor and his family. It has been reported that his brother is one of the directors and that the minister himself holds an interest in the firm. Minister Cormann ought to have confirmed that this morning or denied it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has also been reported that this property was the subject of federal and state investigations into the alleged poisoning of 30 hectares of the protected grass. Minister Taylor, under the ministerial code, is required to be honest. It's a core part of your public duties in serving the public here. His explanation for seeking this briefing is unconvincing. He has claimed that he received the briefing in his capacity as the local member for Hume. But the affected grasslands are almost entirely in another electorate. The timing of this request, the timing of the briefing, the location of the property in question and its relationship to the minister are a remarkable set of coincidences, coincidences that have not been explained in any way this morning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It raises a reasonable concern that Mr Taylor sought that meeting to exert pressure on the department or influence the conduct of its inquiry into his family property. The department was certainly on alert, and you can see it in the nervous emails exchanged between officials. They are especially concerned when there is a direct request from the minister's office that the assistant secretary responsible for compliance be in the room for what is supposed to be a policy meeting. It's a terrible position to be placed in when you're responsible for compliance, isn't it—to be in the room with two government ministers when you're in the process of attempting to undertake an even-handed and fair examination of a set of allegations about illegal land clearing? It's a terrible position to be placed in. This morning Minister Cormann ought to have explained whether or not, as reported, this took place and what the reason was for having a compliance officer in the room.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What about Minister Frydenberg's responsibilities? What does he do as the minister responsible for administering this act? Does he act to protect the integrity of the department? The emails obtained under FOI suggest that his office was very active in helping to set up the meetings for Minister Taylor. The FOI emails state that one of Minister Frydenberg's staff:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">He made the point that for farmers in Monaro this is 'the number 1 issue' of concern for them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what the department are saying amongst themselves. They make the point that it is 'the number one issue' for 'farmers in Monaro'. That's not in Hume, the seat that Minister Taylor is supposed to represent, but it is where the Taylor family's properties are. The other documents obtained under FOI suggest that the minister then sought advice from his department about whether it was possible to secretly change the listings without consultation. What has been Minister Frydenberg's explanation of these actions? Barely anything, and there was nothing from Minister Cormann this morning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These actions raise very serious questions that go to the ministerial standards. The importance of separating private interests from public office appears and is a theme all through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Statement of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">ministerial standards</span>, and I'll quote certain paragraphs.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  I rise to take note of today's statement from Senator Cormann on Treasurer Frydenberg and Minister Taylor in relation to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Statement of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">ministerial standards</span>. The statement from Senator Cormann this morning has failed to address what has now become a systematic expose of the failure of ministers in this government to abide by the Prime Minister's own standards. We have to remember that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Statement of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">ministerial standards</span> is signed off on by the Prime Minister of the day. He is responsible for enforcing those standards. The fact that he cannot—and this is the second day that we've had, really, nonresponses on these questions—is a total disgrace. And Senator McAllister has been through some of the facts of today's instance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I think we should also remember that the public—the people to whom ministers in this government are responsible—would not be very reassured that their government is acting in a way that we might expect elected representatives to act. Yesterday we saw that former Ministers Pyne and Bishop had failed to follow through on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Statement of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">ministerial standards</span>. We actually also have that compounded, possibly, as we do today, by a minister really being mendacious in her statements around whether she had been associated with one of the companies for whom she is now working and receiving pay from.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw last night that this government has no agenda in this 46th Parliament. We see, now, back-to-back nonresponses. We see a government that acts with no oversight, no accountability, no transparency and no respect for parliamentary process and, really, is acting with a complete disdain for the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point of this is that, after last year's coup week and the fallout that followed, this government has to run a protection racket for these ministers. They can't afford to have any more instability, and they know it. Why has there been no formal independent investigation into this? The government is lacking an agenda and lacking legislation to bring to the chambers; maybe what it could do is actually follow through on the Prime Minister's own statement last year where he said that he would look at a federal integrity commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, that is legislation that this government is not going to bring forward, because of course it can't afford to. But, luckily for us, there are paper trails on all of this. Even if Mr Taylor and Mr Frydenberg think that, over the next three years, they won't have a federal ICAC, the paper trail will still exist—because it will be a Labor government that introduces a federal integrity commission; it won't be this government, despite the lack of legislation that was obvious last night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just go through <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian's</span> article. These documents that <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> sought were found under FOI requests, so they are documents from the department itself. Mr Taylor, who was then the Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation, sought meetings with departmental officials to discuss the 2016 listing that protects the natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands as a critically endangered community under federal environment law. The meetings were requested in 2017, via Mr Frydenberg's office. At the same time there were state and federal investigations underway into the alleged poisoning of about 30 hectares that contained the grass species on a property, in the New South Wales Monaro region, which was owned by Jam Land Pty Ltd. Minister Taylor and his brother, Richard Taylor, are directors in that entity. There's also quite a complicated shareholding, because they also own shares in another company called Guffy—that is, the family's investment company.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Taylor denied making any representations regarding the compliance action and he said he'd received a briefing in his capacity as the member for Hume for the purpose of understanding the technical aspects of the revised listing and its impact on those affected. That includes many constituents. He did neglect to say that his family company was one of those constituents so affected and, in fact, that they had unlawfully poisoned 30 hectares of grassland. They then sought to understand that for their constituents—that is, for themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following on from lobbying by Mr Taylor, Mr Frydenberg's office then sought advice on the full extent of his ministerial powers and whether he could override the scientific advice and remove the critically endangered listing. The best bit of this is not only did they seek that; they actually sought to understand whether they could keep that a secret, because they didn't want it made public that they were going to remove a native grass species from the critically endangered list. Why? Because there was something to hide—that is, because a landowner who is also a minister of the Crown in this government and a colleague of Mr Frydenberg's, who was then the minister for the environment, was actually personally affected. That is an utter disgrace. You had a minister for the environment who was actually seeking to weaken environmental protection measures. One might say that that went against the office that he held at that time. We haven't really had much of a statement from Mr Frydenberg. He has been asked many questions on this by journalists, and here today, but he hasn't really answered any of those questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go to the ministerial standards. Section 2.1 states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… it is critical that Ministers do not use public office for private purposes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Section 2.11 states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… these Standards require that Ministers make arrangements to avoid conflicts of interests arising from their investments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is very plain language. That is very plain language for ministers of the Crown and the Prime Minister to follow and for the Prime Minister to enforce. Neither has happened in this instance—neither. It is a disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this makes people think is that we're seeing a total disregard for the wheels in wheels that operate in this government and have operated for some time and a total thumbing of the nose at acting with integrity, which is another word that is sprinkled throughout the Prime Minister's <span style="font-style:italic;">Statement of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span style="font-style:italic;">inisterial </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tandards</span> that no-one seems to follow. People want accountability and transparency from a government. Instead they've got a government whose senior ministers—some of the most senior ministers in this government—abide by their own sets of rules.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday we heard of two former ministers who left this place and went straight into the arms of corporate Australia, ready to swap ministerial knowledge for pay. What we haven't really focused on is former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who's also done that; he's gone to KKR. At some point we might ask some questions about that. But today we see another cabinet minister intervene to ensure the value of his own financial interest. It's imperative that Australians can trust their representatives not to interfere in matters that may relate to their personal financial interests, and to ensure there are no conflicts of interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the first time questions have been asked in relation to Minister Taylor's potential conflicts of interest. He's actually got quite a history. We are seeing an extensive investigation into record-breaking amounts being paid in water buybacks from the Commonwealth involving a company Mr Taylor helped to establish, where the water was of questionable value. One has to ask: does the minister represent the constituents of Hume or does he represent his own family's interests—their property, their share portfolio? Again, what we see is a clear example of how Prime Minister Morrison cannot enforce his own ministerial standards. They are simply not worth the paper they're written on.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="AW5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KIM CARR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:30</span>):  The empirical evidence suggests that increasing numbers of Australians lack trust in the political institutions that we look to to govern this country. The empirical evidence suggests that increasing numbers of Australians feel that the political system—and the economic system—does not serve the interests of ordinary Australians. The empirical evidence suggests that increasing numbers of Australians are deeply anxious that people in authority are not doing their job properly and are not able to reflect the public will and undertake work for the public benefit. It is examples such as this that I think raise serious questions as to why people might legitimately have concerns about the future of democracy in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The questions of ethics and politics and the questions of corruption and maladministration are really important matters that can't be dismissed in the manner in which the Leader of the Government in the Senate did when making this explanation today. To simply come in and say, 'The minister has never sought to abuse his office,' and then sit down is not an adequate response to what have been a series of public disclosures concerning the operations of the now Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, but assistant minister for cities at the time, and the now Treasurer, but minister for the environment at the time, in terms of their execution of their duties. That's not to assume that everything that has been reported is correct in every respect, but there are serious allegations that need to be dealt with, and there is clearly a case for those allegations to be responded to. If the minister given the opportunity today has failed to do so, it may well be necessary for the Senate to take further action to try to get to the bottom of these allegations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The assertion is that Minister Angus Taylor, when minister for another portfolio, sought to have talks with federal Environment officials over an issue at the centre of an illegal land-clearing action brought by that department against a company which he partly owned, along with his brother, and that Minister Taylor, who was, as I said, assistant minister for cities at the time, sought to engage, through the minister for the environment, through a number of meetings, in direct discussions with public officials responsible for the administration of a program outside of his direct ministerial responsibilities, and that those discussions involved matters where his company was the subject of allegations of illegal land clearing. As a prima facie case, that's a pretty serious matter. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I looked back at the standards, and when a minister myself I always regarded the standards as an important document. I always understood that this was potentially a career-ending document if you did not take it seriously. These questions of ethical standards reflect proper public expectations that members of the House of Representatives and members of the Senate, when sworn in as ministers, should uphold. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The statements in various forms since the code has been established have insisted on the simple point that ministers are entrusted with considerable privilege and wide discretionary powers and that the very basic principles of integrity, fairness, accountability and responsibility, and the requirement to act in the public interest are the essence of your undertaking as a minister. The standards have always asserted—yes, it's true—that the privilege of serving as a minister involves considerable personal sacrifices in terms of both your personal time and your requirements to undertake your official duties and some considerable loss of your personal privacy. There is no doubt you are subject to a higher level of public scrutiny while you're in executive office—so you should be!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there was also a written assumption that you should not allow your private life to encroach upon your exercise of public duty and that you don't use your public office for private purposes. That's what the public interest provisions of the job require. There are some provisions of these standards that you take on that are actually lifelong. Some I hear speak of requirements that last only a few months after you've got out of the job. Some of your obligations are actually lifelong. But what certainly is beyond dispute is that while you're in the job you don't engage with public servants about private commercial interests, which essentially is the allegation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been proposed that the minister's company was the subject of this inquiry. He said he was not there to discuss his company; he was there to discuss this as a member of parliament, as electoral matters, despite the fact that the grasslands concerned were actually in another electorate. If you believed his explanation, I would suggest that you are probably so gullible as to believe the Prime Minister's explanation that he had nothing to do with the removal of Malcolm Turnbull—that he didn't manage to find the five votes necessary to get rid of the former Prime Minister. Surely you're not that gullible!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He's entitled to the presumption of innocence, I suppose, but it does lead me to the view that the department's Assistant Secretary for the Protected Species and Communities Branch, Mr Geoff Richardson, and a member of his staff, who were engaged in these matters and had clear responsibilities in terms of compliance matters, shouldn't have been put in a position where they were, even in the minister's words, 'Just seeking technical information'—technical information as a minister? I can assure you that you don't just seek technical information from public servants, particularly about your own private interests. Attempts were made to seek advice on how to change the regulations in this matter and to do so secretly. You have to ask yourself: why is it necessary to conduct these types of inquiries secretly? It's not a matter of national security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It does suggest to me that two federal ministers were flouting the rules and setting the standards of behaviour for ministers in this way. You know the old story about the standard you walk past being the standard you accept. It strikes me that the two ministers are now behaving in a manner which suggests that they acted a bit like thieves in the night. This is not appropriate on a prima facie basis for Mr Taylor, who is now the energy minister, or Mr Frydenberg, who is now the Treasurer, because, if they're accepting that sort of behaviour in those, relatively speaking, more junior positions, what behaviour do they accept now in these more senior positions? As I indicated last night, does it mean you stand over the governor of the Reserve Bank and try to humiliate him and undermine the integrity of the Reserve Bank and think that that's okay? What else does that mean for water rights, electricity or any of the other matters that come under the great responsibilities as a minister of the Commonwealth of Australia? These are profound questions. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  There is, and has been for some time, a crisis of confidence. That crisis of confidence exists within our community—the people we represent here in this place. What they are losing confidence in—and, in many cases, have lost confidence in—is the capacity of those of us that sit in this place to take decisions in the public interest and not in our own self-interest. This is very serious because it threatens the social contract that underpins things like the rule of law and, ultimately, the very fabric of our democracy. It is episodes like those we are discussing today that threaten that social contract. They continually erode the community's confidence in the way we behave in this place. Let's be very clear about this: the allegations are against sitting ministers—people who are paid to make decisions in the public interest and who ought to be expressly prevented from using their ministerial powers to make decisions based on their own self-interest. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that people realise that yesterday the government and Labor voted down the Greens amendment to broaden the Pyne inquiry into the breach of ministerial standards to include Minister Taylor and Minister Frydenberg. That was the collective position held by the major parties in this place, and I am yet to hear from the Labor Party why they would do that. Remember, this is a Labor Party that seems hell-bent on collapsing and agreeing with pretty much every arch conservative proposal put forward by this shocking government. I've said it before, and I will say it again: if Labor are not going to do their job as an opposition, the Greens will step up and do that job for them. Only a few weeks ago, we saw Labor collapse and support the dismantling of the progressive tax system in Australia. We've seen today that Labor are going to collapse on legislation that sets up Peter Dutton as judge and jury when judging whether Australian citizens, including children as young as 14, ought to be allowed back into the country under certain circumstances. We've also seen Labor consistently refuse to take a position on raising Newstart after they went to the election with a wishy-washy policy for a review into Newstart. I invite people to contrast that with the Greens policy, which is for a $75 increase, which is what the sector is calling for. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, when the government and Labor voted down the amendment to broaden the Pyne inquiry into a breach of ministerial standards to include Minister Taylor and Mr Frydenberg, we saw a protection racket. This is a major party protection racket that's part of the cosy deals that are made every single parliament between whichever of the majors find themselves in government and whichever of the majors find themselves in opposition. Let me explain why this protection racket is so important, even to whichever of the major parties sits in opposition—currently, the Australian Labor Party. It is so important because they don't want the dodgy deals their ministers made last time they were in government exposed to the disinfectant of sunlight. That's why this is so important to both of the major parties. The government protect their ministers from inquiries into their shoddy dealings, and Labor are protecting their former ministers, because they know that they have former ministers who have walked into cushy jobs post their political careers, lobbying and representing significant industry sectors in this country. That's what this stitch-up is all about: a mutual protection racket designed to enable ongoing shonky dealings. Of course, the outcome is that the community loses yet more confidence in all of us in this place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is simply not good enough, and the Greens will stand up and point this out at every available opportunity. It's not good enough that we do not have a federal anticorruption authority with true independence from government and with real teeth to address these kinds of issues. It's time that we had one in this country. It's well past time that we have an anticorruption authority. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need a significant review of ministerial standards, and that needs to be done independent of the Prime Minister. It is in any Prime Minister's political interests that his or her ministers are not found to be in breach of ministerial standards. Given the shonky behaviours that we've seen from ministers from both parties over a long period of time, the easiest way to reach that aim of not having any ministers in breach is to simply ensure that the ministerial standards set such a low bar that even a dodgy minister can clear it. That's the situation that we find ourselves in today, and that is the true shame of this debate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the government come in to start this debate and make a response to the Senate—a response which my colleague Senator Waters described as 'completely inadequate'. It didn't even attempt to address some of the significant questions that have been raised about ministerial standards. It didn't even try to address those things. That is the shame here, and it is why we are seeing this critical and ongoing erosion of trust. If people don't think there's a trust deficit in this country in relation to those of us who sit in this chamber, those of us who sit in the other place and, in particular, those of us who have the honour and, importantly, the responsibility of being appointed ministers of the Crown, they simply need to go out into our communities, into the streets, to the backyard barbecues and into the pubs and clubs and have a few conversations with real Australians, because I'm here to tell you that trust in politics and in our democracy is at an all-time low. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a collective responsibility to start what will be a long and difficult road to restore that trust. We could do that if we were collectively prepared to take the actions that need to be taken to begin to rebuild community confidence in politics, in our democracy and in this parliament. But there's a lack of political will to do it. The reason for that is the major party stitch-up, the major party protection racket, that is agreed between whoever happens to be in government and whoever happens to be in opposition, because the government of the day want to protect their ministers from exposure over their dodgy dealings and the opposition of the day want to protect their former ministers from the same. It's not good enough. This parliament deserves better. More importantly, the Australian people deserve better. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  The Greens are opposed to this exemption from the cut-off order. It is absolutely outrageous. These are bills that we saw for the first time yesterday afternoon. They were rammed through the House yesterday. The proposal is to ram them through the Senate today, with the collusion of the Labor Party. It is the absolute abrogation of good process in this place. The bills have had significant changes from the last time they were presented to the parliament. There needs to be time for consultation. There are many stakeholders who are concerned about this legislation. It would be good governance and, in fact, just polite and respectful to give us the opportunity—and to give the government and the Labor Party the opportunity—to discuss this legislation, which has very significant implications. Here we are setting up a drought fund. It is a much-needed fund to provide money for people, communities and farmers struggling with drought. But we've got to make sure that it's the right drought fund, that it is properly set up, that it has good governance. By ramming this legislation through, you are undermining all of that good governance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw this legislation yesterday afternoon. We then immediately moved to work on some proposed amendments to the legislation. I really do want to thank the wonderful drafting team here for getting some amendments together, but they should not have been put under the pump, put under pressure, to prepare those amendments in double-quick time. This is just not the way that business should be done if you are concerned about actually having good processes and good governance in this place. There is no reason why this legislation needs to be rammed through the Senate today. There is every reason why it should be done appropriately, with the proper consideration that the Senate actually is here to give to legislation. This is why the Greens are absolutely opposed to this exemption from the cut-off order.</span>

This process came into being so that this place had time to consider bills when they came in and to stop exactly what this government's trying to do, which is to ram this through this place before we can have proper consideration of this legislation and its implications. What is the government scared of in allowing this to get proper scrutiny by the community—in fact, by the very community that this government says that it is trying to help? Let them have a proper look at this legislation so that we know that they think it's the right legislation. Allow proper scrutiny of this so that a committee reviewing this can actually have advice from the community and from the experts in this area. And, as Senator Rice has just said, we have amendments. We'd be happy to circulate those as well so that people could have a look at those in the committee.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, no, the government's too scared of scrutiny. They just want to ram this through at a moment's notice, trashing the Senate's processes—which is what this is about. This process is in place to allow this chamber to perform its proper role. The Senate is the place where we review legislation, where we give it proper attention, where we find out if it's going to work, where we find out if it needs amendments and where we find out if it's actually going to do what the government says it's going to do. And, shock, horror; it wouldn't be the first time if we found that processes aren't going to work. We've found that many times in committee. Governments don't always take on board amendments, but very often they do.</span>

This is an abuse of the process. It should not be exempt from the cut-off order. It should go through the proper process in this particular house of our parliament. We are opposing this. It is an abuse of process.</span>

I've got to strongly object to the contribution of Senator Siewert. Any proposition that this is being rammed through this parliament is false. This legislation was first introduced into the House of Representatives on 28 November 2018. It had its second reading in this Senate on 2 April, and subsequently we had an election.</span>

So there has been expansive scrutiny by the community in relation to this proposal to establish the Future Drought Fund so that we can provide increased support for drought affected regional communities and farmers around Australia. This is something that has now been debated for eight or nine months. It has been through the processes of parliament for months, and it is now time to get on with it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill contains a robust and transparent governance framework, which has been augmented by amendments made by the previous Parliament in the House of Representatives, and I thank the current and former members of the House of Representatives crossbench for working productively with the Government on these. The governance framework is similar to the frameworks of other funds, such as the Medical Research Future Fund.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill requires the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance to issue directions setting out the Government's expectations as to how the Fund will be managed and invested by the Board, including setting a benchmark return for earnings. In setting the benchmark rate of return, the Government will consider the objectives to grow the fund to around $5 billion and make annual payments to the Agriculture Future Drought Resilience Special Account of $100 million per year to build drought resilience.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will develop and publish the Drought Resilience Funding Plan to ensure that a coherent and consistent approach is undertaken when considering and providing funding for drought resilience projects. The draft Funding Plan will be informed by expert advice from the Future Drought Fund Consultative Committee, which will be established by this Bill. The Consultative Committee will consist of a diverse range of experts in fields such as the agriculture industry, drought resilience and rural and regional development. The Funding Plan will also be informed through public consultation over a period of at least 6 weeks. </span>

To help inform these reviews, the Productivity Commission will conduct an assessment of the effectiveness of each Funding Plan before it expires, including having regard to the economic, social and environmental outcomes. The Productivity Commission will make recommendations and the report will be tabled in each House of the Parliament.</span>

The Regional Investment Corporation Board is a skills-based independent expert board with the knowledge and experience needed to oversee significant government investments in farm businesses and water infrastructure. All funding decisions will comply with the Commonwealth's established rules and guidelines on grants and procurements.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has been absolutely clear that use of the dormant Building Australia Fund to deliver the Future Drought Fund will have absolutely no impact on the funding of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which is fully funded through the Liberal-National Government's responsible economic and fiscal management that has delivered a strong and improving budget position, and a credible path back to surplus in 2019-20. Sustained responsible economic and fiscal management has ensured that the National Disability Insurance Scheme is fully funded, without the need to increase the Medicare levy or proceed with the previous Building Australia Fund measure.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLAGHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Shadow Minister for Finance, Shadow Minister for the Public Service and Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to speak today on these two bills, the Future Drought Fund Bill 2019 and the Future Drought Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019. Labor have made it clear that we are not going to stand in the way of a drought fund. This is a position we've made clear in the House, but there are some criticisms I'd like to make in this speech this afternoon. I'll touch on a couple of points.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first one is around the proper process for these bills. We do believe that this legislation is being rushed through without proper process. The debacle—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Senator Siewert:</span>
                    </a>  But you voted for the bills!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="ING" type="MemberContinuation">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator GALLAGHER:</span>
                    </a>  Could I just make my comments? I listened to yours. In the debacle that occurred in the House last night, every attempt was made by the Labor Party to ensure there was a proper process and proper passage of this legislation, including allowing the opportunity for individual parties to go through their own processes. It has long been the convention in this place that, when you introduce a bill into the parliament, debate on the bill is then adjourned and then there are processes that parties go through in their own organisations and then there are processes that follow in this parliament to have a bill dealt with appropriately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have placed on the record our concerns that that process has been abused and that those conventions have been thrown out. The only reason for this, it seems, is so that the government can play some political game, the politics of wedge. That is the only the reason this has been rammed through; there are no other logical reasons. This legislation was not introduced with the other legislation that was introduced in the first sitting week along with other bills that the government identified as priorities. This legislation was not a part of that. There was no mention of it. The earliest opportunity that money could flow from these bills is 1 July 2020. So, in that sense, the urgency around these funds flowing is not there either. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The substance of the bills is another area that Labor has raised concerns about. This is not a $5 billion fund going to farmers, as the government would like the headlines to read. This is a fund that's being established from $3.9 billion, which is held in the Building Australia Fund, which was a fund established to ensure that there were proper processes around the allocation of infrastructure funding to align with Infrastructure Australia and to ensure, in the national interest, that our infrastructure funding was aligned with those priorities. We are concerned about the abolition of the Building Australia Fund. It was an important microeconomic reform, in terms of the ability to work in the national interest, as opposed to the examples we've seen in working in the National Party's interest. Again, we would be monitoring this drought fund for evidence of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the urgency, what we've seen from this government—particularly in this Prime Minister's rather bullying and arrogant style, which is fast becoming the standard operating procedure of this government since the 18 May election—is that it is essentially looking at how it can prioritise legislation based on fights that they can pick with Labor. We've seen this from so many, including the Leader of the Government in the Senate, the Prime Minister and other senior ministers, who are constantly out and about, going, 'This legislation is a test for Labor.' It is not: 'This legislation is seeking to support farmers, seeking to ensure we have appropriate resourcing going into drought remediation and research.' It is: 'This legislation is a test for Labor.' That's why this legislation has been rammed through over the last two days. In terms of the money that's allocated, not one cent of this fund will flow until 1 July 2020, at the earliest. And it's not a $5 billion fund; only $200 million is allocated for this parliamentary term. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We think it is juvenile and arrogant of this government to use this legislation to play parliamentary games. There are only so many games they can play. Yesterday in this place, they ran out of work on the first real sitting day of the first sitting week since re-election. This third-term government, seemingly without an agenda, is dusting off legislation that it seemingly didn't prioritise in the last term. It was originally drafted and could have passed during the last parliament. The government is dusting off this legislation in an attempt to play a game and set a test for the opposition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government needs to start governing and it needs to start governing in the national interest. I think that's what the people of Australia want. They are sick of the conflict, the argument and the games that get played here in Canberra. It brings my home town into disrepute, I can tell you that. What they want to see is a government that's focused on the issues that matter to them, and those issues are significant and the drought is one of those significant issues. It is the worst drought in 120 years. When you travel around this country, you see the effects of it everywhere. The fact that the government would take a bill that, on the substance of the issue—a fund for drought remediation—should be something that has the unanimous support of this parliament and then use it in a way to try and wedge Labor is, I think, evidence of the fact that the government was not ready to be the government and is still scrambling around, looking at what its actual agenda will be over the next three years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor are not going to play the game. We are prepared to stand up, move amendments, explain our position, argue for good process, argue to ensure that the national interest is being met and argue to make sure that the priorities facing this country are being dealt with. But we're not going to get suckered into the game the government is trying to play with us. We will not stand in the way of this fund, but we don't believe it's going to do the things the government is arguing it will do. We don't know why the government doesn't have a drought envoy anymore. We don't know why it doesn't have a drought strategy. We don't know why it's making this fund wait a year for any application to be considered under the arrangements. We don't think it's enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition has made it clear: come and talk to us about an appropriation to actually support farmers and deal with the worst effects of the drought that is ravaging this country. Come and talk to us. At this stage, this is the best we've got to offer. We won't stand in the way of this legislation, but we are going to make it clear that we don't think this is the proper way to deal with legislation. We don't think it treats the parliament respectfully and we don't think it treats the conventions of this place and the other place as they should be treated—that is, as the parliament has operated for some time now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the other place, Labor suggested a 24-hour delay to allow its processes to occur and to allow for proper consideration of the bills. But the government wouldn't even allow that to happen. Faced with the majority they've got in the House, and the fact that they are emboldened after the election, the thought that they could deny Labor caucus members the opportunity to discuss these bills obviously really excited them, and that's the path that they took yesterday. They wouldn't allow our caucus members to go through our own democratic processes and have that discussion. At the same time that the government was ramming these bills through in the other place, we were left with a farcical situation in this parliament—this chamber actually running out of business and having to revert to the Governor-General's address-in-reply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fund isn't urgent. I mentioned the comments the Leader of the Labor Party made last week, when he made it clear that we will support drought assistance:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We'll support it not just for $100 million; we'll support it at every level you're prepared to put forward. We can bring it forward to the current financial year, not 12 months time. It could be more than $100 million, and we'd vote for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the government is not telling the truth when it comes to the facts about the fund. It continues to call it the $5 billion Future Drought Fund. The $5 billion won't be available for farmers. It's $100 million a year, $200 million over the life of this parliament, and the fund doesn't reach that $5 billion level until the end of the decade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the urgency of this legislation, the government had this legislation before the election but it didn't even put it before the Senate. Why wasn't it urgent then? The weather and the drought situation haven't dramatically changed in the last six months. Australia has been suffering through this drought for many years now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of support, we have played an important role in supporting government action to help farmers make their operations more resilient in the face of drought. We have supported all of the recent and immediate drought measures put forward by the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments, including: an additional supplementary farm household allowance payment of up to $12,000 for eligible FHA recipients; increasing the FHA extension from three years to four years; increasing the farm asset threshold from $2.6 million to $5 million; and increasing the farm management deposit scheme to $800,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think it's fair for those opposite—as they've been attempting to do—to play politics with this, ask Labor which side it's on and use all that poisonous divisive language that Australians are so sick of. When they look at the voting record, when they look at our position on this legislation today, they cannot run any narrative about Labor not being on the side of farmers. Our voting record proves it. This is the pragmatic position we have taken on this legislation today. Despite the attempts by the government to wind Labor up, we will not play that game. We are making our decisions on what's in the national interest and, in this instance, not standing in the way of this fund—despite our concerns about it—is the right thing to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the Building Australia Fund, the Future Drought Fund Bill not only sets up the new fund but also abolishes the Building Australia Fund and transfers the current uncommitted amount of funding, $3.95 billion, as in the 2019-20 portfolio budget statements, into the new fund. One of the arguments made by the government is that nothing has been drawn out of the BAF since 2012-13 and that it's been making small amounts of interest revenue. Let's have a look at that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of attempting to abolish the BAF on a number of occasions for asset recycling, and, most shamefully, attempting to paint Labor as being against the NDIS—those being just two of the examples—a serious government would not have let the BAF sit idle all this time. The Building Australia Fund actually assists people in regional Australia to get goods to markets, to make our roads safer and to build important infrastructure. This government has neglected that and is not talking about that side of the story at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the Building Australia Fund was not a political slush fund. And that's exactly what the government's problem has been with it. It was a major economic reform. It was sensible. It was a transparent means of allocating scarce resources to achieve maximum benefit to the community. It wasn't to allow individual politicians to lobby hard and to get pet projects or special projects in their electorate that didn't necessarily align with the priorities of Infrastructure Australia, who'd go through a rigorous and detailed analysis of the benefits and costs of each project. If, in the future, we were elected and had the honour of forming government, we would re-establish a fund like the Building Australia Fund because we do think it's important that there be a funding component that's linked to the work that Infrastructure Australia does, and we do believe that the Australian people, when they have a look at it, will support independent, at-arms-length decisions made about nation-building infrastructure in this country.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To sum up: Labor supports the bill. We don't want to be painted as a party that opposes support for farmers. As I've explained in my speech, our voting record, the work that the shadow minister for agriculture has done and the comments that the Labor leader has made have made it very clear that we want more assistance for farmers; we want more effort from the government into looking at drought remediation and at things like climate change and the impact that that is having on the agricultural industry and farming in this country. We think a lot more can be done. We don't think this is the sole answer. But if this fund dishes out $200 million—hopefully, to very worthy projects that will have gone through a process that will have been improved through the efforts of the member for Indi—then that will be a good outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as to the way that this has been handled by the government this week—without an agenda or any program, without any ideas on what they stand for, who they are and what they're going to do for the next three years—they have dusted off this bill and gone: 'You know what? This could be fun in the chamber this week. We could really try and put pressure on people if we bring this in and then ram it through the House and then put pressure on people not to support any delays in the Senate. That really could be fun.' That's the only reason we are standing here talking about this bill today—because it wasn't introduced by the government; it wasn't mentioned as a priority bill; it didn't get a mention in the first sitting week; it is not going to come into effect for another 11 to 12 months; no-one will see a cent of this—not one cent—next week, the week after nor the week after that; not for 11 or 12 months will any of this money flow.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do object to the closing of the Building Australia Fund. We do think the reform that was put in place by the previous Labor government to separate infrastructure funding decisions from parliamentarians and to have a better process for aligning a funding source with the decisions of Infrastructure Australia is a much better way to go when you're looking at the long-term infrastructure needs of this country, not short-term pork-barrelling interests. That is the difference. That's what we are walking away from with this bill today. We object to that. I will be moving a second reading amendment. It will in fact be identical to the amendment we moved in the House to make sure that our objections are recorded and clear and that we will, in government, seek to reintroduce this style of fund with this approach in order to make sure that the process for allocating infrastructure is very clean and clear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't believe the government's rhetoric for a minute. This is not a $5 billion fund; it is $100 million going out to projects yet to be determined in a year's time and only $200 million over the next couple of years. We think more needs to be done. When it becomes clear that this is the government's answer to some of these major issues, I think most farmers and most farming communities who are living through this drought will be deeply disappointed.

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:26</span>):  The problem of drought is not going to go away. It's no longer a rare or unpredictable occurrence, like tropical cyclones or tornadoes. It's a harsh ongoing way of life for many Australian farmers, and we need to deal with it. But we simply cannot ignore the elephant in the room. We cannot deal with the problem of drought without dealing with our climate crisis. If we ignore climate change and only throw money at drought, we might as well be putting a bandaid on a bullet wound.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The No. 1 thing that we need to do to support farmers and communities that are struggling with drought is to tackle our climate crisis; otherwise, droughts are going to keep on getting worse and worse and communities will suffer more and more as our climate gets hotter and drier. You only need to look at the news just in the last week. We've heard that the Murray-Darling Basin has had half its normal rainfall this year and the Murray-Darling is experiencing the worst drought on record. Across Australia, the first half of this year was the second warmest on record and we've had the second driest conditions in the 120 years that we've been keeping records. There's even evidence that Australia hasn't been as dry as it is right now for two to three million years. We are still on track for four degrees of warming. If that happens, the climate of our wheat-growing areas will become like the climate of the central deserts—and no drought fund can deal with that. That's what we're on track for by 2070, when these kids that are in the gallery today will only be as old as most of us in here are now. You cannot be bequeathing them that type of future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's domestic carbon pollution is the highest per person of any country in the world. When you add in the pollution that comes from our exports of coal, gas and oil, we're responsible for one tonne out of every 25 tonnes of carbon pollution into the atmosphere that's being released across the globe, despite being less than half a per cent of the world's population. In the carbon pollution stakes, Australia is a massive player. We really do punch above our weight, and we need to equally play a big role in tackling our climate crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of doing this is underlined by the fact that, sadly, we know that we are already in this climate crisis. Hotter and dryer conditions are already baked in. We're dealing with the consequent drought crisis that we have to be tackling, which shows that we must be investing in projects that support farmers in building resilience to face this climate crisis, that build agricultural systems, that work to regenerate our land and our soils, and that reduce rather than increase the water that's being taken from our rivers, our streams and our groundwater. What this means is not building big new dams to prop up unsustainable agribusiness. It means not delivering for the corporate vested interests that are sucking our rivers dry rather than delivering for struggling farmers who really need our help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, as it currently stands, is not what Australia needs. It's been rammed through. It's been used as a political football. But I'm not going to dwell on this, because the issue of drought is too important for us to be dwelling on the politics of how this is being misused at the moment. So I'm going to focus on what needs to happen to improve this bill and on the amendments that the Greens are going to move to this bill, which will make it a bill that can be supported and that will deliver for the struggling farmers of Australia. The problems with this bill start with the deep lack of accountability of the drought minister and the fact that the whole bill and the whole fund that is being invested in are leaving the door open to money actually being invested in fossil fuels, the sector that contributes to drought. There are huge changes that are needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are four issues that the Greens seek to amend, and we look forward to the amendments being supported across this parliament. I'm particularly looking forward to the support of the Labor Party, because many of the issues are those that Senator Gallagher just outlined about the Labor Party's concerns about the bill. Firstly, we must significantly increase the parliamentary oversight of the drought minister. This bill gives far too much leeway to the minister and his National Party mates to pick and choose which projects get funded. Secondly, we must ensure the integrity of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and of our national water laws. Thirdly, we have to make sure that this bill doesn't rip $3.9 billion out of the Building Australia Fund. Our cities and regions are already experiencing chronic underinvestment in transport infrastructure. Instead, the Greens are proposing that the moneys for this fund should come from the billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks that we give to the fossil fuel industry every year. They are the ones who should be paying to clean up their own mess. Finally, it needs to be crystal clear that the investment vehicle for this fund must not invest in fossil fuels. It would be the peak of cynicism to have a drought fund that's designed to help our regions adapt to the impacts of climate change simultaneously investing in the very industries that are causing that climate crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Cathy McGowan's amendments from the last parliament did improve this bill and the transparency and accountability of the remit of the minister, but they don't go far enough. As the bill currently sits, we've got a Future Drought Fund Consultative Committee which must provide advice on the Drought Resilience Funding Plan, and the minister must have regard to that advice. But, when it comes to advice on the design of grants or payments for individual projects, there is nothing. There's no need whatsoever for the minister to listen to the committee. The minister must ask for advice from the committee, but there's no requirement for the minister actually to listen to that advice. They can pick and choose whatever projects they like, as long as it can be argued that overall they comply with that drought resistance plan. So our first suite of amendments is building on and strengthening it to ensure that the minister actually must have regard to the advice of the committee on whether each individual grant or arrangement complies with the plan, as it would provide one further check on the minister's discretion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go to the consultative committee. We're setting up a consultative committee, but who do you think gets to pick the members of the consultative committee? Why, it's the minister. There needs to at least be some degree of proper community oversight over this committee. That's why the Greens would require, first of all, a public call for nominations to the committee, inviting the public to nominate people and then requiring the minister to take notice of the submissions that they receive. Then we would require the minister to publish written notice of their intent to nominate a member of that committee. There should be a submission period in relation to that nomination, and the final decision by the minister must have regard to those submissions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at other bodies that distribute money on this sort of scale, such as the Regional Investment Corporation, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, it's not the minister for energy or the minister for industry running around selecting individual projects to fund. By leaving these decisions directly in the hands of the minister, there is a much higher threshold of accountability that's required. That's why we think that each arrangement or grant should be disallowable by the parliament. We simply cannot afford to have a drought minister pork-barrelling projects across the country with such minimal oversight. Drought mitigation and resilience is too serious an issue for that. We're not saying that parliament should be disallowing hundreds of projects, but it does mean that in any egregious breach of good governance or in cases of clear corruption, which we have seen plenty of evidence of, there need to be safeguards in the public interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our second suite of amendments relates to preventing the Future Drought Fund from ripping billions of dollars out of our infrastructure budget. Yes, Minister Littleproud was correct in saying that the Building Australia Fund hasn't been used to fund projects for half a decade; but that's entirely the fault of the government. The government have chosen to work around the Building Australia Fund because that money actually requires a degree of oversight by Infrastructure Australia of where the money goes, and they don't want that oversight—another example of the Nationals trying to work around good governance and good process to deliver money for their pet projects. But we don't even need to make this compromise. You don't need to raid the infrastructure budget to pay for this drought fund. There are billions and billions of dollars on the table ready to be taken from the very companies who are causing the climate crisis and the water crisis and the drought crisis—the fossil fuel industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens propose that we can raise $4.9 billion over the next two years merely by applying a flat 10 per cent royalty on projects that are subject to the petroleum resource rent tax. This would mean that multinational oil and gas companies like Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell—not the taxpayer—would be funding drought resilience, and they should. It is the climate pollution spewing out of their operations that is causing and exacerbating drought. Right now the petroleum resource rent tax is the most rorted tax in the country. There are over $300 billion of tax credits ready to offset future payments, and they are growing at a higher rate than the bond rate. In its current form, the PRRT is absolutely useless. We are simply letting these giant oil and gas companies dig up and burn our resources for free. If you did fix the PRRT, this 10 per cent royalty would be offset against their liabilities under the PRRT and basically act as a floor. If they are making profits out of digging up our oil and gas, then 10 per cent of those profits should be taxed and go to pay for drought resilience. It's a policy that the Greens took to the election. But, even without changes to the way that the PRRT is calculated, this royalty would at least provide a baseline of revenue for the Commonwealth. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be moving amendments to keep the Building Australia Fund intact. And, yes, we understand the constitutional limitations of the Senate, so our initiative with regard to the PRRT is in the form of a second reading amendment. I foreshadow that I will move my second reading amendment that has been distributed in the chamber, calling on the government to properly tax those oil and gas super-majors to pay for the climate chaos that they are creating. </span>

We want some security that this funding isn't about helping out big corporate irrigators but is about delivering real water efficiency and real land rehabilitation, so we'll be moving amendments to ensure that the drought minister is properly consulting with the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and that the arrangements and grants from this fund are properly compliant with the Water Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we need to be very clear about what this proposed $3.9 billion is for. Yes, there's $100 million going to drought resilience, but that $3.9 billion will be invested in a suite of securities and financial assets. It would be so deeply cynical and ironic if that $3.9 billion, which is designed to generate a self-sustaining $100 million a year drought resilience fund, was in turn investing in the very companies and body corporates that produce the fossil fuels that create drought. The Greens have previously called for divestment from fossil fuels and the tobacco and arms industries across all of the Commonwealth's financial investments, but this is such a clear-cut starting place. How can you not support the concept? It would just be astounding if this Senate thought it appropriate for the Future Drought Fund to invest in fossil fuel companies. To supplement this we believe the investment mandate of the Future Drought Fund should be a disallowable instrument. We must counteract this trend that we're seeing—that is, more and more use of delegated instruments and taking power away from this parliament and putting it in the hands of the minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments are sensible; they follow the principles of accountability of the executive to parliament and proper community consultation. They make it clear that you don't need to lay waste to our infrastructure portfolio to fund drought relief. They ensure that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is protected from further wrecking by the National Party, and they make clear the principle that the very fund designed to ensure drought resilience should not be investing in the companies that are causing the climate crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hope that Labor support these commonsense amendments. But it's hard to hold much hope in them anymore when they seem to be rolling over for the government at every opportunity. They said they were against the government's tax cuts and then they voted for them. They said that Australia needs to act on climate change, yet they voted with the government on a motion supporting opening up the Galilee Basin. Labor says that Newstart payments are too low, yet they voted against the Greens motion to raise the rate of Newstart by $75 a week. Labor said they were against this bill but then they voted with the government in the House, and we just heard Senator Gallagher saying that Labor are not going to stand in the way. What has happened to Labor's principles? Where is their backbone? What is the point? Labor, it's not your job to facilitate the government's agenda. Yes, you lost the election, but millions of Australians voted for you to represent them. Millions of people voted for you in what is now obviously the vain hope that you would actually do something, that you would actually stand up and stand by your principles. Labor, you said that you weren't happy with the bill and that you didn't want the funding to come from the Building Australia Fund, so let's work together. Support these Greens amendments to fix the big problems with this bill and to get that money to the farmers who need it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say: yes, let's create a national drought fund but not a giant slush fund for the drought minister and the Nationals to continue to prop up their mates in big agribusiness, not if it means ripping out nearly $4 billion from our national infrastructure budget, not if it means ripping up the Water Act and the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and building giant new dams for the upstream cotton industry and not if it means creating a new investment stream for coal and oil and gas companies. We can do this; we can create a proper drought fund with proper oversight, and we can make the fossil fuel industry pay for it. Our amendments are sensible. They make important and nuanced  changes to the bill, and I call on the Senate to support the Greens in holding this government to account and ensuring that we don't exacerbate this truly awful drought blighting our country by once again handing the National Party a blank cheque.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  Once again we've been subjected to Senator Rice, on behalf of the Greens, deriding regional Australians, deriding our primary producers, our farmers, our fishers and our foresters, deriding people who are doing it tough in a drought. We are the nation of droughts and flooding rains. That is not just a part of our present and our future but it has always been a part of our past. The Australian Greens come in here as the ultimate hypocrites. They say they support farmers and farming, but the reality is they do not want to see us farming in this country. It is members of the Greens who promote civil disobedience as animal activists rush in to terrorise, intimidate, harass and steal from our primary producers. That is the reality of the Australian Greens and the view they hold of Australian farming families and their communities. The National Party have been in this place for 100 years, standing up for farmers and regional communities, not for some private slush fund, Senator Rice—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President. We fundamentally understand and know that our nation's entire wealth generation comes from regional Australia, from the blood, sweat and tears of our pioneers in the past and from the innovation and the hard work of our farmers going into the future. That's why we as a government are very proud to continue to support our farmers and communities to prepare for future droughts.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite—and we heard it with Senator Gallagher's contribution—complain about not knowing that the Future Drought Fund Bill 2019 was going to be debated this week. I don't know why they didn't hear that at the Bush Summit last weekend in Dubbo. I don't know why they hadn't heard. Maybe they don't read regional newspapers. But blind Freddy knew that this bill was going to be debated this week. I would have thought that any political party that was seeking to form government at this point in our nation's present would have a plan on how to deal with the drought, not just in the present—as we are doing, and I'll run through those initiatives—but onwards into the future, because this won't be the last time our farmers, our communities and our nation experience drought conditions. We need to have a plan to ensure we build resilience going forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a variable climate, and it continues to change. We'll continue to support our farmers to produce the best clean, green product but also prepare for ongoing droughts and climate contingencies. The politics being played by the ALP in the other place last night was absolutely farcical. At the Bush Summit run by <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Tele</span> in Dubbo last week, you would have heard the Leader of the Opposition talk a big game about supporting regional communities and drought-affected farmers and then say he was going to take the politics out of it. Well, all I've seen in the other place for the last two days, on issues that affect drought-affected farmers, is politics being played. There was vote after vote last night, as Tony Burke threw a tantrum around us trying to move this bill forward.</span>

                    </a>  So the opposition choose to play politics with drought and drought-affected farmers because of their inability to make decisions and their lack of understanding and appreciation of the issues affecting regional Australia, whereas we, on the other hand, have a suite of measures already that we've been delivering in government and that we will continue to deliver not just for the present but, as I said, to build the resilience in our regional communities and our primary producers to deal with the next drought.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since we were last here, I've travelled the country, meeting farmers, agribusiness owners, workers and families from rural and regional Australia, many of whom are suffering from the impacts of the drought. From Bowen to Dubbo, Mildura to Port Lincoln and right across the country, the message remains the same. Many of our regional communities are doing it really tough right now. For many, this drought is the worst they have ever experienced. It's long monotonous days of feeding cattle and sheep, of wondering how the next household bill or farm bill is going to get paid, of watching the horizon and the BOM radar results for a speck of cloud and pleasing data, and of praying for rain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our farmers are resilient. They're tough. They're used to the good and bad, but this drought has been tough and is testing even the best farmers out there. From day one, our government has prioritised backing our farmers. They not only feed and clothe our nation but help drive our nation's wealth, as they export 70 per cent of what they produce. The lifestyles of those living in the city are actually only possible because of the hard work of our primary producers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know as a government that, when regional Australia is strong and prosperous, our whole nation's economy is strong. Already as a government, we've provided $6.3 billion to farmers experiencing drought. Our support and assistance measures cover a range of areas, including financial assistance, investment in infrastructure, rural and regional mental health initiatives, combating pests and weeds, making information easier to access and improving existing services such as the farm household allowance and the Rural Financial Counselling Service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we're not only supporting our farmers now. We've always said we will support our farmers and their communities and hence our nation's future prosperity into the future, and that's exactly what this bill does. It is our government's commitment to supporting our agricultural sector into the future. The Future Drought Fund is a long-term investment to build drought resilience, including preparedness and recovery in our most drought-affected communities. It will enable farmers and their communities to fulfil their potential as productive and profitable contributors to the Australian economy by improving the performance of the overall agricultural sector. The Future Drought Fund will support research, development and innovation. We know that healthy farming landscapes created through innovative farming techniques will contribute to a drought-resilient and sustainable agricultural sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From the stump-jump plough to precision direct cropping, our farmers have always led the world in innovation. This fund will ensure the next innovations come sooner to help our farmers to continue to adjust. It will also support the delivery of infrastructure projects, promote the adoption of technology and deliver improved environmental and natural resource management to enhance sustainable agricultural practices. The Future Drought Fund will also provide farm and community support to bolster drought resilience across rural and regional communities. And, once established, the Future Drought Fund will provide a new, secure and predictable revenue stream to build drought resilience across Australia. This funding is additional to the funding already made available by the Liberal-National government to assist farmers during the existing drought and will not replace existing funding measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Future Drought Fund will be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians, and these guys have a proven track record of managing investment portfolios on behalf of the government and of maximising returns over the long term. In setting the benchmark rate of return, the government will consider the objectives to grow the fund to around $5 billion and make annual payments of $100 million to the Agriculture Future Drought Resilience Special Account to build drought resilience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Drought is a constant factor in our agricultural system. The establishment of the Future Drought Fund will provide new, secure and predictable funding streams for drought resilience into the future to ensure the potential of this vibrant industry is realised through resilience planning. Drought has been on our government's agenda from day one. Helping our farming communities face the challenges is a key focus of our government. We won't be playing politics on drought. We'll continue to back our regions, back our regional communities and farmers and fight for the issues they care about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard a lot of talk in some of the contributions about slush funds. I'm sure that, if the Greens held a regional seat—or, indeed, if the Labor Party had seats that were dependent on agriculture—they wouldn't be viewing this money as slush funding; they would be viewing this money as building the future capacity and resilience of those communities and providing more local jobs into regional communities of growing agriculture. For Nationals MPs and regional Liberal MPs, drought programs and future resilience are key not for a slush fund but in building and seeking to secure a safe, prosperous regional Australia and agriculture industry not just for them and their local communities but indeed for our entire nation. I support the bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  In the short time I have before question time I will also begin my contribution in which I rise to speak on the Future Drought Fund Bill 2019 and the Future Drought Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019 and support the amendment moved by Senator Gallagher. I want to make clear that Labor supports all and any actions being taken to support drought-affected farmers and communities. In fact we have supported all recent and immediate drought measures put forward by first the Abbott government, then the Turnbull government and more recently the Morrison government, but these bills are not putting forward any real solutions. The government has had plenty of opportunities to bring forward real funding to support farmers and their communities. Indeed Labor have said time and again that we will support a special appropriation for drought support. We actually want to see this government provide some real funding for drought support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But after six years of wasted opportunities this government is only making our farmers and our rural and regional communities wait even longer for investments. Despite all the bravado that these bills must be passed this week, guess when the money is actually going to flow from this fund? It will be at least a year. Not one cent can flow until 1 July 2020 at the earliest. This urgent fund to relieve droughts across Australia is so urgent that at the very earliest funds won't flow from it for at least 12 months—not next week, not next month, nor even January next year. So much for being an urgent drought package—the glacial pace with which this government moves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only on 1 July next year when we finally get around to the point that funds can actually be distributed from this drought fund, which we have been hearing over and over again is a $5 billion drought fund, guess how much money will be provided from this alleged $5 billion drought fund? It will be only $100 million first for the 2020-21 financial year and then only another $100 million available for the following financial year. That's it: a $5 billion urgent drought fund that won't kick in for at least 12 months and even then will provide only $100 million a year—all this rush for $200 million over two years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Morrison government were serious about assisting our farmers, real money would be on the table right now and real projects would be underway. That's what Labor would like to see happen. As the shadow minister for northern Australia and the shadow minister for natural disaster and emergency management, in addition to being a Queensland senator, I know well the effects of drought and have been devastated at what can only be described as the lack of action from this government over the past six years. Under a mirage of appearing to finally do something on the drought, this government is now rushing through these bills that will abolish the $3.9 billion Building Australia Fund, which is actually designed to build infrastructure in rural and regional communities, including those that are affected by drought, as well as in our cities, and which has been in place for many years since the last federal Labor government established it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That Building Australia Fund set up by Labor, which is now being raided by the government because it's not prepared to make a special allocation to support farmers and rural communities, has built infrastructure like the Ipswich Motorway in Queensland, the Hunter Expressway in New South Wales, the Pacific Highway Kempsey bypass in New South Wales and the Regional Rail Express in Victoria and has fixed NBN blackspots throughout regional Australia. They are the kinds of projects that have previously been funded through the Building Australia Fund under the last Labor federal government. The Building Australia Fund is a $3.9 billion fund that this government has failed to draw on, failed to access and failed to utilise, even though it can support projects in drought-affected communities across—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:00</span>):  My question is to the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Senator Colbeck. I refer to the minister's letter answering questions taken on notice in Senate question time yesterday in relation to the Earle Haven nursing home in Queensland, operated by People Care Pty Ltd, which recently closed with over 70 elderly residents evacuated to other aged-care facilities and a public hospital. The minister's response today confirms that, prior to the evacuation of residents, People Care had at least seven sanctions, including for failing to provide residents with a safe environment and failing to provide adequate nutrition and hydration. In addition, People Care had been the subject of 22 complaints since 1 January 2018. With this history of sanctions and complaints, how is it that People Care was allowed to keep operating the Earle Haven nursing home, putting the health of over 70 older Australians at risk?</span>

Quite simply, it is because, as sanctions, which are a function of the quality system that we operate in this country, are applied, corrective action is taken to deal with the sanctions. Sanctions aren't necessarily a mortal process in the quality system. They are actually a mechanism by which the quality agency goes in, conducts reviews of the activities within a service, says to the service, 'You need to take corrective action,' goes back, and assesses the corrective action that's been taken. Once the corrective action has been taken to resolve the issues, the sanctions process is closed. On each occasion in previous circumstances, that's exactly what happened. So the agency went in, corrective action was taken to resolve the issues and then the sanctions process was completed. That's what happens in all circumstances where there are issues that are found in aged-care facilities across Australia. That is actually how a quality system works.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The process is: an inspection is undertaken, defects or faults are found, corrective action is taken by the facility under the supervision and direction of the quality agency and, once those processes are completed, the sanctions process is closed. That's happened, as you've noted, on a number of occasions.</span>

As the events of 11 July unfolded, I did become aware of those matters. I wasn't previously aware of those issues that you've raised with respect to the subcontracting arrangements and also the directors who were involved. In fact, that's one of the reasons that I've instigated the inquiry that I had. It's those sorts of issues, through subcontracting processes, that I want to get the answers to because, as we have all agreed in the chamber, we want to prevent those sorts of things occurring. I wasn't aware and I don't think anyone was necessarily aware of all of the details that Senator Watt— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I also note how much I enjoy working with her on defence research and academic work in Tasmania. Thank you. Australia does have a longstanding defence relationship with the Pacific island nations. They're our neighbours and they are our friends. This is because Australia and the Pacific island countries recognise that a stable, secure and prosperous region is in all of our interests.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over many years we have made an enduring contribution for the security of the region through our defence cooperation. This contribution is clearly seen in the Pacific Maritime Security Program. This program, which builds on the success of the Pacific island boat program, has three main parts. It includes new patrol boats, 21 across the Pacific and Timor-Leste; it includes a program of region-wide aerial surveillance; and it includes enhancements to the way the region works together, through support for the forum fisheries agency.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This program will help Pacific island nations to protect their own sovereignty. By being better positioned to provide for their own security, they will be able to protect their natural resources and protect their prosperity. The Defence Cooperation Program broadly provides training and support to the security and defence forces in the region by engaging with our partners in the region.</span>

We're increasing our maritime and land presence to conduct training activities with Pacific island military and security forces. We're convening an annual joint heads of Pacific security event here in Australia, reinforcing alumni networks in the security sector and, most importantly, expanding sporting engagements, which I know my colleague will greatly appreciate.</span>

Australia's commitment to this relationship is shown through the strength of our Defence Cooperation Program. The Australia Papua New Guinea Defence Cooperation Program is our largest globally, standing at more than $40 million per annum. Under this program, the Australian Defence Force and the Papua New Guinea Defence Force conduct a significant program of activities together. These include exercises and operations, mentoring and training, maritime engagement, capability development, infrastructure development and also more general capacity building. Yesterday, I was greatly honoured to engage with my counterpart from Papua New Guinea, the Hon. Saki Soloma, their Minister for Defence. Minister Soloma and I discussed how we can drive greater defence cooperation together as part of the new comprehensive strategic and economic partnership agreed by both of our prime ministers yesterday.</span>

What we've agreed is that, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of our Defence Cooperation Program, Australia will provide a new package of initiatives to Papua New Guinea. This package is valued at $20 million and will continue to build on the breadth and depth of our enduring defence partnership. The initiatives will focus on building a minimum sustainable PNG capability. There will be four main components to this assistance. Firstly, we have committed to supporting PNG to build a balanced and sustainable aviation capability. Secondly, we have committed to an expanded maritime security partnership. Thirdly, we have committed to building an infrastructure investment program. Fourthly, we will support PNG's vision to build a force for the future. It is indeed fitting, in the 40th year of our defence cooperation, that we elevate our deep and enduring partnership together.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:11</span>):  My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. In the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet's report in relation to the application of the Statement of Ministerial Standards against former Ministers Pyne and Bishop, Dr Parkinson states that the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ms Bishop, 'did not have any contact with Palladium in the five years that she was Minister for Foreign Affairs'. A video filmed of Ms Bishop's then office, titled 'Australia’s Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop, commends shared values and Palladium’s business partnership platform,' was posted on 9 June 2017 on the Facebook page 'Palladium: make it happen'. What action has the Prime Minister or his office taken to verify the claim that Ms Bishop did not have any contact with Palladium in the five years that she was Minister for Foreign Affairs, given this latest revelation?</span>

After the arrest of four French journalists in Queensland yesterday, has the minister or her department been in contact with the French ambassador or attempted to assist the journalists concerned? Furthermore, what diplomatic steps would the Australian government take if an Australian journalist were arrested in similar circumstances in France or perhaps Hong Kong?</span>

The Australian government has also directly invited media organisations to provide direct submissions to government, and has engaged with those organisations prior to this, of course, on those key issues of concern to them, and the government is looking forward to working with them and continuing what is a constructive dialogue over the coming months. We are committed to ensuring that, in our democracy, we strike the important right balance between a free press and keeping Australians safe—two fundamental tenets of our democracy which Australians expect us to observe.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">From day one, the Liberal-National government has backed our farmers experiencing drought now and into the future. Our government believes in the productive capacity of our primary producers and the potential of rural and regional Australia and the seven million Australians who live there, because our government knows that when our regions are strong so too is our nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we've invested more than $7 billion in our drought response, which delivers ongoing, immediate and long-term support to our producers and their communities, including $266 million provided to over 11,000 farmers on farm household allowance; $40 million in additional farm household allowance lump-sum payments to nearly 6½ thousand farmers; $77 million invested in the Rural Financial Counselling Service, helping 4,000 farming businesses; $35 million to support more than 10,000 households in drought areas, delivering cash and vouchers from local charities; $131 million for the Drought Communities Program, to deliver local infrastructure and drought relief projects; $50 million for on-farm water infrastructure; $2.7 million for localised weather guides; $72 million on a special drought round of the national water infrastructure fund—and I could go on.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has always committed to helping our farmers in recovery after drought and allowing our farmers and communities to focus on the future. The Future Drought Fund is a long-term investment in the drought resilience that our communities need. It is now up to our chamber here to show they are also on the side of our farmers. This week, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the moon landing, we've seen one small step for the Labor Party; it's time to take the great leap and support our farmers affected by drought.</span>

The establishment of the Future Drought Fund will provide a new secure and predictable funding stream for drought resilience into the future. The government intends to grow the fund until it reaches $5 billion, while at the same time drawing down $100 million per year from July next year to build drought resilience across Australia. This will support R&amp;D and innovation and infrastructure projects and deliver improved environmental and natural resource management to enhance agricultural practices. From the stump-jump plough to precision direct drill cropping, our farmers have always led the world in innovation, and this will ensure the next innovation comes sooner. Our fund demonstrates government's commitment to supporting farmers and communities to prepare for the inevitable future droughts.</span>

Already wool production and sheep numbers have hit 100-year lows. Our horticultural sector is concerned about its ability to plant and harvest a number of crops. It is likely that without spring rain our grain production will take a huge hit.</span>

Bill Shorten was preparing to put his hands into the pockets of Australians who have worked hard and were saving for their retirement.

If only there was a bit more division on the Labor side when it comes to protecting people's superannuation savings. If only there was a bit less unity on the Labor side behind this proposition that there should be higher taxes on everyone that moves across Australia. The truth is: if Labor had been successful at the last election, Australians saving for their retirement would be $30 billion worse off right now. It's to the great relief of Australians right around Australia saving for their retirement that the Labor Party was unsuccessful and that we have been successful because taxes across Australia will be lower as a result, the economy will be stronger and, indeed, Australians will be safer and more secure.</span>

All senators, I'm sure, are looking forward to an outstanding first speech later this afternoon. We wish her well for that. I thank her for her first question, particularly as it focuses on the tourism sector—an industry so important to Senator Chandler's home state of Tasmania, as it is right across Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Wednesday the National Visitor Survey was released. It showed that Australians took some 109 million overnight trips and spent a record $75 billion over the last year, up some 14 per cent on the previous year. Australians are, in increasing numbers, choosing to holiday at home. The number of overnight trips to the state of Tasmania, I'm pleased to say, increased by some 12 per cent over that time horizon as well, as part of the booming tourism industry we're seeing in Tasmania.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, international tourism is also growing strongly, with international spending hitting some $44.3 billion. These are tourists, domestic and international, coming and spending up in accommodation providers, in restaurants and in attractions right across our regional towns and cities, and, in doing so, creating and underpinning vast amounts of employment. Indeed, around one in 13 Australian jobs relates to our tourism industry. That's testimony to the fact that so many hardworking tourism operators show initiative, drive and entrepreneurship across regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm delighted to say that these figures show that we have now met and surpassed the Tourism 2020 target that our government has been striving towards. We've done so ahead of time. I acknowledge the hard work and effort of the tourism industry right around Australia and the state, territory and regional tourism partners who work collaboratively with Tourism Australia, and I thank all of those partners for their efforts in getting us to the point where our tourism industry is supporting and underpinning so many jobs and so many small businesses right around Australia.</span>

These Australians, as well as Australians who are receiving tax cuts from the coalition government, will have more money that they can invest and spend in regional tourism when travelling around our country, supporting and underpinning those jobs. They will have far more than they would have had if those opposite had come along with their tax slugs on retirees and on people's savings, which would have hurt our economy and suppressed our tourism industry, which is instead growing strongly, thanks to Liberal-National policies.</span>

Last week, Senator Cash told a VET conference she was 'passionate about lifting the profile of vocational education'. What is the government's plan to support these young apprentices, many of whom are school leavers, to ensure they stick with their training all the way and actually emerge with a qualification?</span>

You are correct in saying that the government is providing significant support to help young Australians get into apprenticeships. It is a significant challenge to do that in our economy at the moment. While apprenticeship numbers have been down for some time, youth unemployment is also down over the past few years. The government is investing to help support new apprenticeships through our $60 million investment in the Australian apprenticeship wage subsidy trial. That builds on other initiatives the government has in place, which include an additional identified skills shortage payment of $156 million and the incentives for the Australian apprenticeships program of $44 million. These are new initiatives that build on the Skilling Australians Fund, which was established in the last couple of years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has announced a request-for-tender process associated with the Australian Apprenticeship Support Network. That was announced in June by Minister Andrews. The process will ultimately lead to an RFT which will outline the kinds of services and support that service providers would provide to help apprenticeships, not just to fill those positions but also to make sure they have the requisite training and, as the senator outlined, make sure they continue in their apprenticeship and ultimately to get support. That is in the process of being developed with service providers and those interested in this space.</span>

It was established in 2017. It was always a time-limited program, due to finish on 30 June this year, which it has done. According to my notes, it has assisted 30,000 apprentices, which is a great outcome. The program provides in-training support and mentoring in particular to help apprentices stay in their program. While the program has ended, the government intends to ensure that, going forward, all Australian Apprenticeship Support Network contracts will require providers to facilitate mentoring as part of their in-training support—it will be taken into an existing program. The government recognises the important value that mentoring has in supporting young Australians through their apprenticeship. This of course is in addition to many of the other investments I mentioned, over $500 million in skills and our skills package, which is a $3 billion investment in vocational education. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I refer you to my answer to the previous question and that is that no debt recovery has occurred in Townsville. But if there are any particular instances the senator is aware of where somebody who has been impacted by these absolutely devastating events in Townsville, where we saw people displaced from their homes and extreme amounts of damage as a result of the floods that happened earlier this year, I would be more than happy to take on any information. Obviously I am not prepared to discuss in this chamber specifics of individual cases, but I would be more than happy to take on any individual issues that you believe have occurred, because, to the best of my knowledge, there has been no debt recovery commenced in Townsville.</span>

We on this side of the chamber also believe that a sustainable welfare system is not only important; it should also help the people who rely on it. That is why this government rolled out the cashless debit card trials in four sites across Australia. But we rolled them out in sites where the communities actually volunteered, put themselves forward and asked for these particular trials to occur, because they believed there was an opportunity to make real change in their communities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These communities are reporting exceptionally positive results to us from these trials. Last month I had the pleasure of being able to attend the Goldfields, in Senator Brockman's home state of Western Australia, and I learnt firsthand from a number of people—people in the business community, police, health workers, local business owners—about the impact that the card has had in their communities. And there was one clear, strong and uniform response. The people told me the card was making a difference: the streets in their towns were quieter and they felt safer. The police said to me that the number of call-outs had reduced significantly, from every night of the week to maybe only once a fortnight. There was a significant decrease in the number of incidents of domestic violence and mental health being reported. There were significantly fewer presentations to our emergency services. </span>

I'd like to tell you that Nicole told me she's just bought a car, and she credits the fact that she was able to buy a car to the cashless debit card. She said if she hadn't had the cashless debit card she never would have been able to do so.</span>

There have been over a dozen pieces of research done into the trials of the cashless debit card and income management programs that exist around Australia. Most recently the baseline report into the Goldfields has come back with some particular findings. The key ones that have come out of this are: a decrease in drug and alcohol issues; a decrease in crime and violence and antisocial behaviour; an improvement in child health and wellbeing; improved financial management by those on the card; and an ongoing, and even strengthening, community support for the card. But these findings aren't new. These are the findings that we have seen from previous research. In fact, we had an independent evaluation that came out and said: 'the considerable positive impact of the card'. The consistent themes that come out across all the research are improved child wellbeing, reductions in drug and alcohol use and gambling, and improvements in financial literacy and financial management.</span>

The fundamental changes that have occurred with the cashless debit card have been about making it easier and more streamlined so that when people who are on the cashless debit card, or other income management systems, use the card it's much more simple. We've been working with the banks around Australia to make sure that EFTPOS machines in the maximum number of locations are able to use the card. We've also been working with major retailers to make sure that their EFTPOS is connected with their point-of-sale systems so that the card operates no differently from any other debit or credit card that anybody in this chamber would use. That is why we believe that the continuation of the trial sites across Australia, as announced on 25 March this year, is tremendously important. We believe the continued investment in technology will make this program better, as we believe investment in technologies will make the lives of all Australians better as they interface with their government.</span>

Last week the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority released a position statement recognising that climate change is the greatest threat to the Great Barrier Reef. It says:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Only the strongest and fastest possible action on climate change will reduce the risks and limit the impacts of climate change on the Reef.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It also said that 'there is an urgent and critical need to accelerate actions to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions' and that that must happen in parallel with resilience-building actions. Are you going to listen to the pleas from your own agency for genuine, swift action on climate to protect the reef, or are you just going to cut their funding again or give it to some other body to do the job?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Waters is quite incorrect when it comes to funding in relation the Great Barrier Reef. The government have proudly provided record levels of funding to support the Great Barrier Reef—to ensure its resilience, to invest in its future—and we do that in partnership, where we can, with the Queensland government and other authorities. This government is also proud of the fact that, as a nation, we continue to be on track to meet and exceed our 2020 emissions reduction target. We're confident that we will meet and, we hope, exceed the 2030 emissions reduction target that Australia has committed to as part of the global effort.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's often overlooked when the Greens ask questions on these topics, but addressing climate change issues requires a concerted global effort. Australia is but one nation in relation to that. We, however, are one nation that can be proud of our record of meeting and exceeding the commitments that we made, and we can be proud of the fact that we will continue, where we make commitments, to meet and exceed those targets. Indeed, our work, in particular our work on Australia's emissions per capita and emissions intensity across our economy, means we are at the lowest emissions level in 29 years, as a result of a range of policy efforts that have been made, and that contributes towards Australia's efforts to meet our overall emissions reduction target.</span>

The reef narrowly avoided a World Heritage in danger listing in 2015—it's up for reconsideration by the World Heritage Committee next year—and we've also just seen one of the world's most respected naturalists, Sir David Attenborough, describe Australia's failure to act on climate as 'extraordinary'.

Our commitments and our actions are those of just one country. In relation to climate action, Australia cannot address this issue in isolation; we do it in partnership, through the Paris agreement. We will meet the targets that we've made in the Paris agreement, which are significant targets in terms of reduction by between 26 per cent and 28 per cent in relation to Australia emissions targets.</span>

We address issues in addition to those climate change issues that we work on globally, through the Paris agreement, and we work instead on the resilience issues around matters such as soil run-off and emissions that you get in other ways in terms of the nutrients that flow into the reef that can be of harm.

Can the minister confirm a company in which Mr Taylor has an interest, Jam Land Pty Ltd, is now being investigated by the Department of the Environment and Energy in relation to the alleged illegal land clearing of critically endangered grasslands?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Northern Australia and Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:52</span>):  I thank Senator McDonald for her question and know about her passion for supporting the development of North Queensland. You need to have reliable and affordable energy to develop any part of the country. As I know Senator McDonald would know well, in North Queensland there is not a reliable baseload form of power supply. The northernmost power station of that kind is west of where I live in Rockhampton, and Susan lives up in Townsville. There's nothing in between or, indeed, further north of Townsville, so it was very exciting that the government was able to announce a couple of weeks ago that the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility had approved a loan of $610 million for a proposed power station to be built in an old gold mine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Genex Power's Kidston pumped hydro project would provide reliable and affordable power for North Queenslanders, protect jobs in North Queensland, help families in North Queensland and bring down electricity prices in North Queensland, and it would also have benefits across Queensland, given electricity prices are averaged for households across the state. The project itself would also, of course, have a lot of direct benefits. Five hundred and ten people are expected to be employed in its construction, and in an ongoing fashion there will be 30 full-time jobs. Overall, Deloitte estimates that it will provide a $235 million economic benefit to the Queensland economy, and part of those benefits include electricity price savings of around $500 million from this project alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These investments and other investments that the government is making are directly helping to bring down power prices, because the way we bring down power prices is to invest in more power supply. If we have more power supply, that will help take the pressure off power prices, and that's why we support all types of power generation. That's why we support the ambition of North Queenslanders to have the same types of reliable power supply that the rest of the country has, and that's why this investment from the NAIF is such a game changer for North Queensland.</span>

As I have alluded to, the government is supporting all types of energy investments across the country. The Genex power station is a very exciting project, but the government is also supporting a proposed high-efficiency, low-emission coal-fired power station at Collinsville in North Queensland. That's a great project—a fantastic project—that is being proposed by a company called Shine Energy, owned and operated by traditional owners. It is owned and operated by Indigenous Australians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ashley Dodd is the managing director. He is a person of the Birri Gubba nation. He and his people want power supplies, just like the rest of the country. So, guess what? Our First Australians want reliable and affordable power to provide jobs for themselves, just as much as we have access to it in other parts of the country. So I applaud Ashley Dodd and the Birri Gubba nation for bringing this proposal forward. The government is supporting it through funding a business case and I wish them all the best in development of their great proposal.</span>

We just have to look over in the corner of this chamber to see exactly what will happen if we oppose power supply. Over there we have a mob of Greens who are opposed to coal, opposed to gas and opposed to nuclear, and they're opposed to their wind farms as well! I don't know how we're going to generate power in the country if these guys ever have the levers of power. They're opposed to all types of power supply, basically, in this country. They don't support solar—they'll find a reason to oppose solar as well at some point!</span>

                  </a>  The opposition are a complete joke on this. Here's the issue on this issue of air arrivals: when people arrive illegally by boat they rarely have identification documents. We have no information on them, and that means an extended protection claim and legal process. In addition, these people also risk their lives on a perilous journey.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, in contrast, when people arrive by airplane we have their passports, as well as any other relevant travel documentation. We know who that person is, and that allows us to take a quick consideration of their protection claim. In addition, a plane flight is considerably safer than a boat journey. So here are the facts, which those opposite either ignore or don't choose to look at: between 2014-15 and 2017-18, 64,362 people arrived by air and subsequently applied for protection. In the same four-year period, 7,615 people were granted a protection visa. This is a refusal rate of approximately 90 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who are rejected are expected to return to their country of origin. So you might be trying to get some easy press on this, but the reality is we have a growing number of international students and tourists coming to our country, and that is a great thing. We want all of those numbers to increase. As numbers increase, of course you will get an increase in all sorts of categories of people arriving and making claims to stay, and so you would expect that number to grow merely by the fact of the number of people who come here by air. But the government is taking appropriate steps to deal with this, including through the use of airport liaison officers in Dubai and in major hub ports so we can offload people where we know there is a threat.</span>

Let me provide you with facts about air arrivals. If the information I provided to you wasn't enough, let me provide some more facts. Between 1 January and 31 May this year, there was a 32 per cent decrease in protection visa applications lodged by Malaysians compared to the same period in 2018. Between 1 January and 31 May 2019, there was a 20 per cent decrease in the number of protection visa applications lodged across all nationalities. These declining figures are noteworthy—</span>

It was you who opened all of the detention centres, offshore and onshore. And it was under your government, when last in government, 1,200 people died at the hands of people smugglers, so I have got to say it is the height of cheek and hubris and deception to try to draw that bow to the side of the government, because we are extremely proud of our record of fixing up your mess and stopping the deaths that you caused.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians (Senator Colbeck) to a question without notice asked by Senator Watt today relating to Earle Haven Retirement Village.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had another pretty ordinary performance today in question time from the Minister for Aged Care, Senator Colbeck. Yesterday, his performance on these important questions could be best described as 'bumbling', and we've moved on today to 'hopelessly deluded'. Yesterday Senator Colbeck was unable to answer the most basic questions about this terrible incident at the Earle Haven nursing home, where about 70 elderly residents had to be evacuated to other aged-care facilities. He came back to the parliament earlier today to answer the questions he was unable to answer yesterday, revealed that, in fact, the situation at Earle Haven was even worse than we all realised and then had the hide to argue in question time that all of these sanctions issued against Earle Haven amounted to corrective action—that that was the system working and protecting older people, that things were all okay despite sanction after sanction being issued against the operators of this nursing home, a company called People Care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've learned today from the questions that Senator Colbeck has now answered is that, in fact, in the years leading up to the evacuation of residents, there were at least seven sanctions issued by Senator Colbeck's own agencies against People Care for their inability to run the nursing home properly or in line with legislative standards. In addition to those sanctions, there have been 22 complaints made about People Care since 1 January 2018, a bit over a year ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These sanctions that were issued against People Care by Senator Colbeck's own agencies were not for small matters like the lawns not being mown properly or a lick of paint being needed on some of the buildings or the gates; they were for very serious matters. The seven sanctions that have been previously issued against People Care by Senator Colbeck's own agencies are for things like failing to provide elderly residents with a safe environment. Does it get more basic than that? This operator was unable to provide a safe environment for elderly residents. Senator Colbeck's agencies knew about that and issued sanctions against People Care, but they've continued operating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People Care were also judged to have not provided adequate nutrition and hydration to elderly residents in the time leading up to the incident a bit over a week ago, and they've also been sanctioned for not providing the required financial reports. The limited facts that we already have indicate that there's been some sort of financial dispute; either someone was unwilling to pay the staff and the operators or someone didn't have the money to do so. I would have thought that not lodging financial statements might also be a sign that things aren't really working out. As I said, in addition to that, there have been 22 complaints made about People Care in a bit over a year leading up to the evacuation of residents just over a week ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than coming in here and saying that this is disturbing, that it does appear that there's been a failure of the system and that the regulators have failed to do their job and have let down these elderly residents, their family members and the staff at this nursing home, Senator Colbeck instead says that that amounts to corrective action, as if everything is fine. I would have thought corrective action meant actually doing something to fix this or to stop this operator from continuing to not provide adequate nutrition and hydration to residents. It might amount to stopping them failing to provide a safe environment. That's what corrective action looks like, rather than handing out a sanction one year, letting things roll on, handing out a sanction another year and this series of events accumulating and getting to a point where a nursing home has to be evacuated and emergency relief has to be found to look after these elderly, vulnerable people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't say that I'm at all satisfied with what Senator Colbeck has had to say so far. It suggests that he doesn't take this seriously, in the way that many people on the Gold Coast do and many people around the country who are concerned about aged care do. He needs to do a much better job of answering questions that Gold Coasters will have about this incident in the future. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Northern Australia and Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:09</span>):  I do welcome the questions that Senator Watt has put on the record these last two days. This is an extremely serious matter, and I applaud him for bringing it forward. It should definitely be subject to appropriate scrutiny here in this chamber. It's nice to see that question time is used to investigate what are very important, weighty matters—matters that have clearly affected individuals very severely—although I am a little critical, as I think at times Senator Watt moved into more of a political mode. I think he did himself a disservice when he said that the minister's been bumbling and things like that, as what we really need to focus on is not the minister involved but the 71 residents who've been impacted by this unfortunate set of events. We also need to learn the lessons and make sure these sorts of things do not happen again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While Senator Watt has said that a number of actions have taken place, I do think it's important to have on the record exactly what those were. Certainly it is not true to say that somehow People Care Pty Ltd, the operator of this centre, was not subject to scrutiny or action from the Commonwealth department. Indeed, from the advice I've got from the Department of Health in Queensland, I believe the sanctions include ones as recent as 13 July this year, 11 May 2017 and 3 June 2016 and go back to 30 April 2007.</span>

                  </a>  I'll take that interjection, Senator Watt. The logical consequence of some of what you seem to be suggesting is that, any time there is a sanction, a centre should be shut down. We've got four sanctions over an extended period of 12 years. I don't have in front of me exactly what those sanctions were or are, but I don't think the logical consequence of any—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator CANAVAN:</span>
                  </a>  I've got four written down here, but it might be seven. I don't agree with the logical consequence that you seem to be suggesting—that is, any time there is some kind of sanction, we should shut down the facility—because, obviously, that would have a very big impact. What we need to have is appropriate regulatory action, depending on the severity of the breach. That is good regulatory practice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given this event has occurred, the right thing for the government to do is respond expeditiously to help those impacted, and that has occurred. Both the Commonwealth government and the Queensland Department of Health acted quickly to ensure that a level of care was provided to those impacted. That included the appointment of two nurse advisers. We've mobilised departmental staff to assist nationally. We've established an emergency hotline and we're now undertaking an assessment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once that initial care is provided, the next most important thing to do is to make sure that anything that has not been done correctly by the department or the regulatory authority is properly investigated. That's why I do welcome these questions. The government has already announced a full inquiry, to be led by Kate Carnell, into the circumstances leading up to the collapse of this facility to make sure we understand why it happened and, if anything has gone wrong here, to make sure appropriate action is taken and, of course, to put in place measures to ensure it does not happen again. That is what the government is focused on doing now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, the government here, in this space, is taking the issue of aged care incredibly seriously. It's been a strong focus of the Liberal-National government for the past few years, and it has been a particular focus for Prime Minister Morrison in his term. One of the first decisions he made as Prime Minister was to establish a royal commission into aged-care facilities and aged-care services. Even before the findings of that commission are released, we will be increasing funding for the aged-care sector by $7 billion over five years. That will make sure we deliver more home care places and develop the skills that are needed in the workforce to provide a safe environment and a quality service to our older Australians. This is much more additional funding than was delivered by previous governments. It is right and proper that we make these decisions, given our ageing population and the clear requirement that we treat the older people in our society with the respect and care they deserve. We are never going to get everything to be perfect, but the most important thing here is that we provide assistance to the people impacted and ensure that, as a government, we do things better every day and provide a better service to our older Australians over time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  I too rise to take note of the questions that Senator Watt asked Senator Colbeck, the minister for aged care. I agree with Senator Canavan that we need to take care of our elderly Australians. We need to respect them. But we need to make sure that they're living in a safe environment. This government is in its third term. You are in your third term. You cannot pretend that these things just happened yesterday. You guys need to step up to the mark and actually make sure that aged-care facilities are run in the way that they should be. There have been seven sanctions, as Senator Watt mentioned, for basic issues, including not supplying a caring environment or a safe environment, and a sanction around nutrition and hydration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I don't know how many aged-care facilities people on that side have been in, but I've been in quite a few over my lifetime. In fact, I worked in an aged-care facility for two years when I was a student nurse, to subsidise my student-nurse income. I've seen it firsthand. That was some time ago, I will admit; that was a number of decades ago—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator BILYK:</span>
                  </a>  Thank you, Senator Watt. I'll remember that you were kind to me. It was a number of decades ago, but I think things have gotten worse. We've got waiting lists as long as your arm for people going onto home care packages. We've got a government that doesn't take this issue seriously. Senator Canavan said you do. You're in your third term. All you do on that side is blame Labor for things. Honestly, there comes a time when you've got to draw a line in the sand and take some responsibility for being the government. I'm calling on Senator Colbeck to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Senator Colbeck was answering the questions, I've got to say he left me feeling quite concerned, because I didn't feel his answers were suitable for other senators in this chamber or acceptable to the general community, and certainly not for our ageing Australians. In the minister's home state—we both come from that beautiful state down south, Tasmania—there's a total of 2,142 Tasmanians just waiting for a home care package. They haven't even been offered lower packages than they're entitled to. This includes 63 Tasmanians awaiting a level 1 package, 665 awaiting a level 2 package, 918 awaiting a level 3 package and 496 awaiting a level 4 package. This is not good enough. Sadly, I think the Earle Haven issue is a sign of what we'll probably see more of. I think that is horrifying. It should be horrifying to all of us. It was distressing for the clients and it's distressing for the staff. And there are issues around whether the staff are going to get their due entitlements. I know that staff up there are very concerned about what has happened to the clients as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's this whole thing about what we came into politics for. What do we come into politics for? People say, 'I came into politics to leave a better society for the next generation, a better community for the next generation.' I'm certainly one of those people that have said that on numerous occasions. Also, I came in because I care about the vulnerability of all Australians, especially our elderly, who often don't have family that can advocate for them. I'm wondering how much advocating had actually happened for people in Earle Haven and other areas around the state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to make sure that, as a government and parliament, we care about these older Australians. Lacklustre answers by the minister are not good enough. There's a crisis in aged care. On this side we have been pushing and pushing for changes in the aged-care area for a number of years. In fact, Julie Collins, the member for Franklin, for whom I'm the duty senator as the shadow minister for ageing and seniors, has talked for years about what needs to happen. We're banging our heads against a brick wall. But you know what? It's up to you guys. You guys are in your third term. You need to sharpen your pencils and get on with the job. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The welfare of older Australians is of utmost importance to this government, and the characterisations by those opposite of the minister's response are—and I'll put this mildly rather than strongly—grossly unfair. I have spoken to Minister Colbeck about this issue and I know he cares very deeply about it. Those opposite need to be very careful that they don't seek to politicise this issue in this way. They know that the sanctions imposed on the facilities concerned were not the cause of the evacuation. It followed a contractual dispute, and Senator Watt, in particular, knows this, because, in paying tribute to everyone involved, he stated, as recorded in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I'm sure that when those people turned up to work that day they weren't expecting that they were going to be part of some mass evacuation exercise. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And that's true. If staff on the absolute front line of this very sad situation weren't expecting it, how would anyone else have been? </span>

                  </a>  The sanctions, as you very well know, Senator Watt, were not related. This government and this minister have taken swift action. This minister has instituted an independent inquiry, which will look at everyone, including the department, to learn what we can about how we can operate better into the future—and, obviously, the aged-care royal commission will also be a very important part of informing where policy in this area goes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government with a very, very strong track record in supporting older Australians, particularly older Australians in aged care. The Morrison government is increasing funding in aged care by $7 billion over the period 2017-18 to 2022-23. That will deliver more home care places, keeping people in their own homes for as long as possible. It's about continuing to develop a skilled workforce so that those who are looking after our older Australians have the skills that they need to do so in a safe, effective and efficient manner. We also are looking at improving the systems to provide safe and quality home care and residential care. This is an ongoing process. There was the More Choices for a Longer Life Package in the 2018-19 budget and More Choices for a Longer Life in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013, when Labor was last in office, funding for aged care was just over $13 billion. In the next financial year it will be around $21.7 billion, and that will grow to over $25 billion by 2023. According to reporting in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span>—I don't know how much credence we should place on that—in Labor's election costings there was no additional funding for residential aged care or home care places. So we have a situation where we have a government that is responding to the needs in the sector. We understand that older Australians are vitally concerned about their future, how long they can live within their own homes and what they're going to do after that is no longer possible. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2019-20 budget allows 10,000 additional home care packages to be released across all levels. That's at a cost of $282 million to the budget. This was announced in February of this year, and it recognises the increasing demand for home care packages. People do want to stay in their own home as long as they possibly can. In March 2019, the government announced the largest ever expansion of residential aged care in Australia's history, with 13½ thousand new places at a cost of around $907 million a year, plus $60 million in capital grants to grow residential aged-care services. There are issues in this industry, but this is a government that's delivering.</span>

The answers to the questions today focus not on the immediate movement that should have occurred, but also on the immediate movement that should occur still across the country in terms of the care of our seniors. In the Northern Territory, there are 34 people in the Royal Darwin Hospital alone who should be in aged care. The lack of home care packages and funded aged-care beds is impacting on our public hospital system, with bed shortages and overcrowding. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I certainly want to see the current minister go to the Northern Territory to see for himself how older Territorians die waiting for packages and appropriate care. I'd certainly like to see him out in our remote communities, the remote regions of the Northern Territory, where there is an acute shortage of aged-care services, so that he can get a clear understanding of where this government is failing. He needs to talk to the Indigenous elders. They want to live out their lives caring and being cared for on country—passing on songs, their gudjiga, their map, their songline and their stories to the younger generation. But they can't, because there are no aged-care facilities in some of these communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd certainly like to see this government properly fund our aged-care services so the unacceptable waiting list for home care packages is reduced so people don't die waiting. In the Northern Territory, the Council on the Ageing has long called for a good look into the aged-care licensing system and how it is operating there. COTA NT, who do a fantastic job advocating for older Territorians, want to see the appointment of an aged-care quality and safety commissioner who could do spot checks on service providers to ensure that people are getting the services and the packages they qualify for. Such a position could go a long way to making sure the situation at Earle Haven in Queensland isn't replicated anywhere else in Australia and, in particular, in the Northern Territory. In any year, 16,000 Australians die waiting for a home care package that meets their needs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">National Seniors Australia have been very clear about the impact of the chronic shortage of home care packages across the country. They've described this government's neglect of seniors as a form of elder abuse and a national emergency. National Seniors Australia's chief advocate, Ian Henschke, called for urgent action again this week. As this government has shown today by their responses to the very valid questions raised by my colleagues, there is a disrespectful lack of urgency to create change and ensure that vulnerable Australians are well looked after. Yes, there is a royal commission underway. But that cannot be used as an excuse not to act immediately on the day-to-day issues that are impacting on this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We shouldn't have to remind this government that at the end of 2017 the waiting list for home care packages was 104,000. When the royal commission opened in January this year, it was 128,000 and was described as cruel, unfair, disrespectful and discriminatory by the counsel assisting the commission. Six months on, the waiting list has blown out by more than 1,000 older Australians. They know that 1,000 Australians turn 80 each week. These are our loved ones, people at a fragile stage of life who want to remain in their homes under the supported care of their families. Yet this government refuses to prioritise the care of our elders. They take their eyes off the ball, and even those who do receive packages can end up on the street.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment (Senator Birmingham) to a question without notice asked by Senator Waters today relating to the Great Barrier Reef and climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked about the really powerful position statement that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the government's own authority, had issued last week, begging for urgent acceleration of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, not just this focus on resilience, which the government likes to trumpet frequently. Of course we need to do resilience work, but here is the reef authority calling on and begging the government for action on climate change to reduce emissions to give the reef any chance of survival. I put that to the minister and asked him, 'Would the government genuinely listen to this advice from their own body—from its own expert scientific body?' and I'm afraid I didn't really get an answer. I had included a quip about whether they would just cut funding for GBRMPA instead of listening. I'm afraid the government has form in this regard. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has been subject to those efficiency dividends that every other department has also been subject to. They have had cuts to their funding. And it is not only that; we saw that a rival private charitable organisation got almost half a billion dollars of funding, allegedly to protect the reef, rather than that money going where it naturally belongs: to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. I didn't think my assertions were unfair, but of course it gave the minister a lovely premise to ignore the bulk of my question entirely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He then tried to assert that, actually, Australia can't do much to protect the reef anyway; we're just one nation amongst many. Do we run that argument when we are talking about our chances of Olympic gold? No, of course not. We talk ourselves up when it suits us, and this government talks down our ability to show leadership when it matters when it's inconvenient for them and when it shows up their absolute obsession with new coal thanks to the many millions of dollars that they receive in donations from the coal and gas companies every year to fund their own re-election campaigns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister then ran that old trope that the government likes to trot out: that we'll meet our emissions reduction target, so therefore everything is fine. Well, the scientists have been saying for many years now that those targets are inadequate. They will not save us from extreme weather events; nor will they save the reef from losing the coral cover that it's already lost 50 per cent of in those two successive bleaching episodes in 2016 and 2017. That is exactly what the marine park authority was drawing your attention to by saying we need this urgent action to accelerate greenhouse gas reductions. It is saying that your existing climate policy is not good enough to save the reef. I don't know what about that advice is unclear. I know you've got a tin ear to science and I know it's blocked by the dollars that flow in from the coalmining companies, but what more can the scientists do to try to beg for action? They are doing their utmost. They are your own people—independent scientists.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is not a lack of scientific consensus here. We all know what needs to be done to save reefs globally, including our beautiful Great Barrier Reef, which supports 67,000 people in work. You love to crow about how the best form of welfare is a job. Well, what are you going to say to those people whose very product is being damaged thanks to the policies and the lack of action by your government? The minister didn't really have a very good answer to that at all. Instead, he then blamed the Australian Greens and said we're the threat to the reef, as if reflecting the scientific concern and begging for action is somehow the problem and somehow what's wrecking the reef. No, it is greenhouse emissions that are wrecking the reef, and it is your government's continued useless policies to tackle climate change that are wrecking the reef. I thought it was just a little bit rich to turn the finger on our party and blame us for the death of the reef. We have been here, working for many years in concert with scientists to try to get some action out of you and your government, and we will not stop doing that, because we care for the 67,000 people relying on the reef, we care for that $6 billion that's propping up our economy and we care for the amazing biodiversity that is in that reef. It is not for us to destroy the seventh wonder of the world. We do not have that right. Just because you get a few million bucks from coal companies, you then write your own climate policies. What a cheap date you really are. You are selling out the reef.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm afraid I got no decent answers to my reef question even when I cited Sir David Attenborough's call and his description of Australia's climate policy and our failure to act as 'extraordinary'. If you won't even listen to your own agency, if you won't listen to the likes of Sir David Attenborough, if you've got a tin ear to the marine park operators who have finally spoken out—and they've been very worried for a long time, but they're worried for their product and haven't spoken out; they've had the guts to do so now and you're still ignoring them—I don't know what is going to get through to you. But we're not going to stop trying.</span>

Lawmakers will be less able and inclined to curtail or remove freedoms and only dare propose to—let alone succeed in doing so—if the rationale is explicit, unavoidable and compelling.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Why is it now necessary to better prescribe and protect what was long implied?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since Federation, our Constitution, lawmakers and common law practitioners have implicitly upheld these Australian freedoms; treating them as default positions to be keenly defended and protected. They were considered inherent and unalienable; unable to be taken away or transferred, and pre-existing of the state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In fact, many of our predecessors—or founding fathers of the liberal-democratic West—considered that the nation-state only arises to better ensure, via a constitution, the protection of those unalienable freedoms (and maybe very little more).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unfortunately, these freedoms—long-considered implied and existing by default in our Constitution and common law—can no longer be taken for granted. As myriad new rights are defined, with new laws enacted and new legal and corporate precedents set, these unalienable freedoms are being gradually whittled down, crowded out and competed away. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In this postmodernist politically correct (PC) era of identity politics, new rights, laws and interpretations are proliferating; ones that reward or appease certain interests and divide humanity into groups, often based on identity. Human and other rights are being increasingly contrived for certain groups or agendas which intrude on and undermine the inherent freedoms, dignity and sanctity of the individual. This in turn unpicks the fabric of liberal-democratic society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In fact, more—not fewer—anti-discrimination Acts, commissioners and enforcements are being proposed by many, and not always from one side of the political aisle. Moreover, in law and in practice, the term "discrimination" has worryingly broadened. In many circles—both legal and social—it now seemingly also includes criticism, critique and anything other than endorsement, celebration and praise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Will we one day have to overtly and eagerly applaud certain things as do North Koreans in front of their President?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Tepid tolerance or mere acceptance—that may trigger discomfort, hurt feelings or offence—can be construed as borderline discrimination and grounds for sanction. As such, anti-discrimination laws can become useful weapons to ostracise and suppress criticism of certain positions and views, driving opponents out of the public space and eroding fundamental freedoms of speech, expression, association and conscience. By doing so, it also prevents us from considering, describing and solving problems that a liberal democracy is so good at and exceptional for, relative to the socialist, tyrannical or developing world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To counter this trend of new PC rights and anti-discrimination law eroding our unalienable freedoms, piecemeal Acts are being proposed to protect very specific freedoms. For example, a freedom of religion Act has been proposed to protect the views and practices of the religious from the relatively new, but burgeoning, rights of the LGBTIQ+/rainbow community; one that has become quite imperialistic and aggressive since winning the same-sex marriage debate in 2017, as many predicted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unless handled very carefully—both legislatively and in subsequent interpretations and practice—such a response gravely risks a slippery slope towards blasphemy laws, which certain religions and their adherents will eagerly exploit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Another trend eating away at our unalienable freedoms is the rise of a disturbing form of PC corporate fascism. Increasingly, large employers and organisations are requiring their employees to sign employment contracts that place myriad PC prohibitions on the private lives, expressions and conduct of those employees; either due to pressure from sponsors, Twitter and social media or from the PC busybodies increasingly nesting in their own human resources or communications branches.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The typical justification is that it helps prevent employees from tarnishing the good name of the employer or brand and risking bringing it into disrepute. This has the effect of employers increasingly owning the lives of their employees in totality; not just the work that they do or the roles and tasks they perform. Without restoring some balance and common sense here, many unalienable freedoms of these individuals will be stripped away as they become, in effect, wards of their employers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Such freedom-sapping terms in these contracts should not be enforceable, let alone drafted in the first place. However, in this era of Twitter and social media they are becoming the norm and employees feel that they have no choice but to accept and live by them. Whilst this Bill does not directly limit corporate fascism, it will help curb new laws being made that enable and encourage it. It also opens a potential avenue for the examination of existing anti-discrimination laws and practice which, in turn, could help identify and address their freedom-sapping effects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, certain anti-discrimination law and practice can give rise to policies of "diversity and inclusion" in a workplace or industry sector. However, when activists are allowed to drive these policies and their enforcement to the extreme, unwanted views, ideas and people can be conveniently nobbled or even driven out of the public sphere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is another justification for an Act that seeks to prioritise the unalienable freedoms of all Australians and helps to remind us of our liberal-democratic roots and better selves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the United States, they at least have a Bill of Rights—comprising the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution—to counter these assaults and forays on basic freedoms. We do not. Sadly, it seems, we can no longer rely on our lawmakers, judiciary and corporations to uphold the freedoms that made Australia so free, expressive and prosperous. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These freedoms need to be reasserted—not through a US-style Bill of Rights, which would be overkill—but through a change to the law which makes it far more difficult for the Parliament to ride roughshod over our unalienable freedoms with so little justification when passing laws conferring new rights on certain citizens or groups (or examining existing laws that are shown to gratuitously crimp these freedoms).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australian freedoms (and sovereignty) are being eroded by forces both within and beyond our borders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The United Nations (UN), through its myriad treaties, conferences and compacts, seeks to undermine the sovereignty of liberal-democratic nation-states. These UN instruments and agendas also deliberately curb the liberties of the citizenry of these states to determine their own outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Last December, the UN held migration and climate conferences in Marrakesh, Morocco and in Katowice, Poland respectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Thankfully, the Australian Government was sensible enough to reject signing the Global Compact on Migration in Morocco; designed to lay the foundation for open borders through a "right to migration". However, concerningly, the UN's other migration compact—on refugees—has yet to be as keenly rejected by our Government and so remains very much in play.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The UN climate conference in Poland further pushed signatories to the Paris Climate Accord—like Australia—toward a "right to sustainable development". These conferences and their outcomes empower radical green ideology on climate change and till the soil for all the redistributive taxes and stultifying regulations that are intended and will inevitably flow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Last month's conference in Bonn, Germany, saw the UN climate agenda co-opting rainbow and indigenous politics to further unite globalist, left-wing causes and undermine the freedoms of the individual in favour of "woke" identity groups.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On another domestic front, over the last decade, we have seen the atrocious free speech cases around section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act (RDA). These involved Queensland University of Technology students, the late Bill Leak (and in a similar scenario Herald Sun cartoonist, Mark Knight), Andrew Bolt, Sonia Kruger and Samantha Armytage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In each of these cases, someone was able to take offence at what had been either said, drawn or written, file a basic complaint to the Race Discrimination Commissioner of the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) —either openly or anonymously—and have that complaint enthusiastically taken up by the Commissioner. The respondent was then dragged through copious lawfare often without the complainant further impacted (even known).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under section 18C of the RDA, the process imposed on the respondent has become the punishment. Such capacity for hit-and-run offence-taking invites vexatious, effortless complaints that target and silence political opponents. Any PC identity group protected by such legal rights and processes can weaponise the system to take out its opponents as well as shield other groups from that opponent's scrutiny and criticism (for example, Andrew Bolt).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The section 18C cases have had a chilling effect on speech and expression in the indigenous, immigration and multicultural space. So much so that real problems, valid criticisms, necessary critiques and likely solutions cannot be freely discussed as the threat of lawfare—for commentary which falls far short of defamation, libel and incitement to violence—looms large.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is why we, as Australians, need to more explicitly define and protect our unalienable freedoms in law; to stop the encroachment of other rights being defined and enforced, particularly those favouring PC identity groups and their activists.</span>

                    </a>  The government is committed to ensuring our democracy strikes the right balance between a free press and keeping Australians safe—two fundamental tenets of our democracy. That's why the government has asked the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to conduct an inquiry into law enforcement and intelligence powers in relation to the freedom of the press. The PJCIS is well placed to conduct this inquiry, given its responsibility for and experience in handling issues concerning national security information and legislation. The PJCIS has already commenced its inquiry and will report back to both houses of parliament by 17 October 2019.</span>

                    </a>  Unlike the Morrison government, Labor believes in freedom of the press and the public's right to know. We believe this inquiry is essential because it will be carried out by a committee that the Morrison government does not control. That the Morrison government opposes this inquiry tells the Australian people all they need to know about this government's contempt for freedom of the press and for the Australian public's right to know what this government is up to with their money, including the litany of policy disasters and personal scandals that the Morrison government is always trying to hide from the Australian public. A strong and independent media is vital to holding governments to account, and Labor will continue to fight to defend and strengthen press freedom through this inquiry.</span>

                  </a>  Labor co-sponsors this motion, acknowledging that across Australia the age of criminal responsibility for a child is 10 years of age. This is too low and impacts on First Nations communities and families, and it's devastating. The National Children's Commissioner recommended that the age be raised to at least 12. The Don Dale royal commission in the Northern Territory recommended increasing the age to 12. This is yet to be implemented. On 23 November 2018 the Council of Attorneys-General established a working group to review raising the age of criminal responsibility, with the requirement to report back in 12 months. The government must work with all jurisdictions to raise the age of criminal responsibility.</span>

                  </a>  We should be ashamed of the cruelty that is allowed to go on in animal agriculture. Many farms do not use cruel practices, but many do—especially industrial factory farms. Dehorning and castration of cattle and debeaking of chooks goes on without any pain relief. Chickens are locked up in cages for all their lives; they can't even flap their wings. Pigs are in pens where they can't even turn. Australian people love animals; they want animals to be treated with kindness. Yet this government, rather than improving animal welfare laws and practices, is obsessed with attacking people who actually expose this mistreatment, cruelty and abuse. Shame on you! You are on the wrong side of history.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0U" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON-YOUNG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:59</span>):  I stand today to speak in favour of this MPI put forward by my colleagues. What we saw yesterday in Queensland was a disgrace—an attack on the freedom of press in this country. It was an attack on the freedom of everyday Australians to have their voices and their concerns heard about what goes on—the decisions that their government makes. Australia is a wonderful democracy; we are a free and open democracy. Transparency should be at the heart of all of this. The idea that protesters are being intimidated from being able to peacefully show their discontent with government decisions or company actions—let alone the police crackdown on journalists who are simply doing their job and reporting on these protests! What is the government afraid of? What is the government afraid of that they don't want the rest of the country or, indeed, the world to see?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than shutting this down, what we've seen is that Australians are very, very wary. The moment a government comes in and tries to silence people, you know something's actually going on. The moment a government comes in and says, 'We are going to send in the police force to shut down the protests and to shut up the journalists,' you know there is actually a real problem. This is in a long line, of course, of erosions of press freedom in this country over the last number of years. Thankfully, just moments ago here in the Senate, we've seen this chamber establish an inquiry into press freedom in this country. Thank goodness, because we need to get to the bottom of what's really going on and what laws need to be in place to ensure journalists can do their job without fear or favour. But of course this is much bigger than this, because what we saw yesterday in Queensland is a demonstration of the heavy handedness of not just this government but the Queensland government and what is to come if decent Australians don't stand up and demand their rights to have their voices heard and to protest peacefully. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is happening at a time when our television screens at the moment are full of footage of what's going on in the streets of Hong Kong, where everyday citizens are putting their positions on the line, their lives on the line, for democracy. They are fighting for democracy, and they are fighting for the right for a free and open press and the right to dissent peacefully without the fear of retribution. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here, in Australia, I hear my colleague, Senator Canavan arguing that there was an election. Well, yes, there was an election and yet many, many people—millions of Australians—did not vote for the policies of this government. Many, many Australians are very concerned about the policies of this government, particularly when it comes to the issues of climate change and approving one of the world's largest coalmines—which is, of course, Adani. This is what's wrong with this government. As I stand here defending the rights of everyday Australians, whatever view they hold, to protest without the fear of arrest and intimidation, as I stand here today in support of journalists being able to just do their job, I can hear the screeching from members of the government who think that because they won an election it should be a free-for-all. Because they won an election, they are so arrogant that they think nobody else's view should matter. That is how these people rule. They are a group of self-entitled grubs. They think no-one else should be able to have their own opinion, protest peacefully or report on these protests, because they hold the keys to the Lodge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the arrogance of this government, the hubris of this government. We can see it all over the place. Even the Prime Minister has had to tell his own colleagues in the party room today to pull their heads in because the arrogance is getting out of hand. You've now got members of the government arguing that we should have nuclear power in Australia; that we should change the government's policies on super; and that we shouldn't have members like Senator Dean Smith, who stood up yesterday in this place with his own voice and his own conscience and argued that Newstart should be lifted. But what's happened? No, the Prime Minister wants to rule with an iron fist. The result is that it trickles down to individuals right around this country, everyday citizens and Australians who should have the right to stand up for what they believe in and to stop dangerous projects that they see are going to impact on the future of their kids.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Adani coalmine is an issue that affects every Australian. It's not just for people like Senator Canavan over here to say, because he's now on the front bench, that it should be his way or the highway. It shouldn't just be that this government can intimidate individual citizens to stop them voicing their opinions and send chills through media agencies across this country and indeed overseas, because they shouldn't report on protests, they shouldn't report the facts of what's going on and they shouldn't ask questions of the government without fear of being charged, locked up and arrested.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't live in a police state. I know Senator Canavan might want us to, but we don't. We don't live in a police state; we live in a free and open democracy, and our citizens have the right to stand up, to have their voices heard and to protest peacefully. I call on them to continue to do that, because, at a time when we are facing such a crisis when it comes to our climate; our environment; and, as we're seeing the erosion of freedom of the press, the freedom of everyday Australians to have their own opinions and voices heard, this is a moment to stand up and stare down the government, who think it should be their way or the highway. Well, no, we're not going to stand here and let the government run roughshod over everything. We're not going to stand here and allow the government to intimidate everyday people to stop them from having their own opinions and standing up for their own land. Of course, this government doesn't even think that farmers should have the right to say that they don't want mining operations in their own backyard. This government doesn't believe that everyday Australians should be able to stand up and protest against spending billions of dollars to prop up the coal industry. This government doesn't think that journalists should be able to report the facts without fear or favour. That is what is going on here today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can hear the hubris from the other side. Senator Canavan thinks it should be his way or the highway. That is the arrogance of this government. That is the arrogance of the Morrison government. They think it should be their way and nobody else's. What they're doing is putting at risk not just our environment and climate but also our democracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier today during question time, I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Payne, what she is going to do to help relieve anxiety around the erosion of press freedom in this country. We've had four French journalists held for several hours, arrested and charged all because they were simply reporting on a peaceful protest—a peaceful protest that happened to be against a project that this government is in love with. This government—members in this place—has taken donations from the company that wants to set this project up. No wonder they don't want anyone either in Australia or overseas knowing about what's going on. This is a danger not just to our environment; this is a danger to our democracy. Unless we protect the rights of people to protest, to dissent, to ask questions and to report the facts whether or not the government like them or not, then we are on a slippery slope towards the type of arrogance and iron-fist rule that this government think they already have the capacity to do. Well, you don't. We're all watching and we're going to call it out.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Northern Australia and Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  Well, that was 10 minutes of wind and straw. There was nothing of any substance there. There were certainly no accurate representations of positions that anyone is putting in this debate. No-one that I've heard from in the government—indeed no-one really anywhere in society—is saying that people shouldn't have the right to protest or have their voices heard, or that journalists shouldn't have the right to report. No-one has that position whatsoever; no-one at all. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, I think I was more welcoming of the Bob Brown convoy to Queensland than anybody else around. I embraced the Bob Brown convoy. I am happy to go on the record that I welcome law-abiding protests in Queensland and I hope we have many more of them in Central Queensland soon. Since the election I have invited Bob Brown back to Central Queensland many times. Alas, he hasn't taken up my invitations yet; but hope springs eternal, and I do hope that Mr Brown—and maybe Senator Waters will join him this time up in Central Queensland—will come, and they can all express their democratic right to put their position to the people of Central Queensland, as they were welcome to do during the election. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are against is people who break the law. What we are against is people who trespass on private property. What we are against is people who interrupt law-abiding citizens going about their average day and life. We are against people who potentially put lives at risk by unnecessarily and insensitively holding up traffic in a major city without knowing who might be in these cars or what they've got to get to. There might be people with a doctor's appointment or people who need to pick up children. They don't care. They are showing gross disregard for all Australians through the illegal activities that are occurring in Queensland right now. That's what we stand against. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How absurd is it for the Australian Greens to come into this place and compare those that are supergluing themselves to street corners, that are swarming traffic lights in the CBD, that are putting other people's lives at risk by trespassing in dangerous environments in ports and rail lines—how absurd it is that they would compare themselves—to those around the world campaigning for greater democratic rights? As I pointed out in interjections, how absurd is it that the Australian Greens are complaining that these people represent a pro-democracy movement when we have just had an election in this country that resoundingly supported the policies of the government which were to support the development of the Adani Carmichael mine? I do think the Australian Greens need a dictionary, because that is the definition of democracy. We've had an election. We had a vote. There was a majority in favour of one set of policies and a minority against them. That was decided. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, no-one is saying that that minority—clearly they were in the minority—who were opposed to the Adani Carmichael mine are not entitled to their views. No-one is saying they shouldn't be listened to. No-one has suggested that they should now stop putting their views in the public domain in any way, shape or form. But it is a contentious issue. It has been a contentious issue. We have a way in our society to resolve contentious issues peacefully and respectfully. That most important way is through the ballot box in this country. That is what we have done. We have done it. You couldn't have had more resounding support for the Adani Carmichael mine from the people of Queensland and the people of Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed someone sent me the other day some analysis that shows there is a statistically significant relationship between the swing to the government and the distance of a polling booth from the Adani Carmichael mine site. It was very clearly supported. There were swings to the LNP of 10 per cent and more in Central Queensland. I know the Labor Party are reflecting on that now—what went wrong for them. Clearly, one of the things that went wrong is that people in Central Queensland didn't think the Labor Party was supporting their jobs, their futures, their children's futures as much as we were this time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that a result as emphatic as this will see the Labor Party reflect on that—there have been some good signs already that they may have done that—and we can marginalise the Australian Greens here. They are welcome to their views, but sometimes in this place they like to speak as if they represent a vast majority of the Australian people, when their vote, when you look into it, is around 10 per cent. They are lucky to crack double digits. All those people are welcome to their views and they are welcome to their votes, but they are nowhere near a majority of this country. The majority of this country want to work and have a future for their children where they can actually provide for themselves. The majority of this country have no problem with making sure we supply essential resources to the rest of the world through our coal, iron ore, gas and other resource industries. We are very proud of that. It's a fantastic industry, which we should be proud of, and most Australians have no problems in doing that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I indicated, I am a little torn on this motion, because in some ways I do want to promote these protests. I haven't seen better advocates for the mining sector in this country than those supergluing themselves to the streets of Brisbane. I try my best as the resources minister. I have been trying to fight to get this Adani Carmichael mine going for years, and Bob Brown turns up in Queensland and has it going within weeks. It is a bit frustrating for me how hard I'd worked for years to deliver this result, and Bob Brown came in and swept away and took all my thunder and within weeks this thing was going. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then, unfortunately, Bob Brown has not been back to the sunshine state, but those that are applying superglue liberally to themselves at the moment are continuing his good work. There is no doubt about that. They are demonstrating exactly why mainstream Australians reject the narrow, dismissive, negative policies of the Australian Greens, who do not seem to want to build anything anywhere. These guys wouldn't support a footpath being built at the moment. They do not want to support any kind of development in our nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The hypocrisy of these protesters is clear as well. That was clear in the convoy that came up to Queensland, who were powered by diesel and petrol. They were happy to come all the way from Tasmania to lecture the good people of Central Queensland about how immoral and evil they were, but of course they were allowed to fill up at every petrol station along the way to make sure their convoy could continue to go. That hypocrisy is continuing, as well, with these new protesters. I noticed one of the first group of people, a group of two people who superglued themselves to Queen Street in the middle of Brisbane the other week. I can understand why supergluing yourself to a hot bitumen road would be uncomfortable in Brisbane. These two protesters had thoughtfully brought along some of those rubbery mats that click together—the jigsaw ones you can get at the hardware store. They had brought along some of them to lay down to superglue themselves to those. That was thoughtful and took a fair amount of planning in their case. However, I don't think they realise that those mats are called EVA foam mats. EVA stands for ethylene-vinyl acetate. The feedstock for that, the way you create that, is from a product called ethane, which is derived from petroleum products. So they were laying themselves on fossil fuels for their own comfort. They couldn't even, in their own protest, not rely on the uses and benefits of fossil fuels in our modern society. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It gets worse for them, though. I was doing a bit more research. The modern superglues themselves are also derived from petroleum products. How hard it is to be pure when you are a Green activist in this world! There are fossil fuels all around us. It is very hard to deny yourself the convenience of these modern products. Unfortunately, it is extremely hard for these protesters. It is just so unfortunate that we could not power our country through hypocrisy, because it would truly be the ultimate renewable power source. We would never have another blackout in this country if we could just harness the extent and significance of hypocrisy that comes from the Australian Greens and their like in our society and community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It just continues on and on. Unfortunately they can't seem in any way to have a level of self-reflection about these matters. You would think that someone who faithfully—I give to the Australian Greens that they faithfully took a particular position on the Adani Carmichael mine—you would think that, having had that position so resoundingly rejected by the Australian people at an election just two months ago, they might want to reflect. They've asked us in this debate to listen to their protesters. I say I do. I've got no problem with their views, but I would like the Australian Greens to pay us the same courtesy and try to respect and listen to the people of Central and North Queensland and maybe understand what they are trying to say to the Australian Greens—what people who may not be on social media, who may not be on their Facebook feeds or their Twitter feeds might think and like for their own future. There has been no self-reflection from the Australian Greens since the election. There's been no understanding of the views of the Australian people and, unfortunately, that's unlikely to change any time soon.</span>

It's actually not about the people of Queensland. It's actually not about people's jobs. It's not about the environment. It's actually just something that's being used as a tool by both of the extremes in politics—the Greens on the far left and the National Party on the far right—to whip up their vote at the expense of most Queenslanders. Frankly, I'm getting a bit tired of this just being used as a culture war</span>

              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WATT:</span>
                  </a>  I will come to you in a moment, Senator Waters; don't worry. I'm getting a bit tired and I think most Queenslanders are getting tired of being the tools, the pawns of the Greens on the one hand and the National Party on the other—coming down here constantly and coming into elections using coal and communities as a tool to get their own votes up rather than actually thinking about the real future of Queenslanders. We've seen it here again. I'm not going to waste too much time dealing with this culture war that is going on between the Greens and the National Party other than to say I do think that it is important that the Greens be held to account for their incredibly self-indulgent behaviour through the most recent federal election campaign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, it's not often that I agree with Senator Canavan, but I will agree with him on one thing today, and that is that the only people who benefited from the Bob Brown convoy during the most recent federal election were the Greens on the one hand and the National Party on the other. It actually wasn't about the environment. It wasn't about the people of Queensland. It wasn't about jobs. It was about getting Senator Waters's bum back on the seat where she is right now. That's what it was about. It was exactly the kind of behaviour you would expect from the Greens. We have all come to understand that what the Greens are about is stunts. Bob Brown convoy stunt? Got a big tick there. They are also about self-indulgent behaviour. That's what we see from them every single day down here. Bob Brown convoy? Self-indulgent. Tick. It is incredibly insulting behaviour towards most people who live in that region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are genuine issues about the future of coal and they are issues that deserve reflection, deserve rational debate and deserve facts rather than this kind of overheated rhetoric that we see from both of the extremes in Australian politics as we continue to from the Greens and the National Party. We have seen it here again today with Senator Hanson-Young having a crack at Senator Canavan and Senator Canavan having a crack at the Greens. Senator Waters is up next, and I'm sure she'll be having a crack at Senator Canavan. We don't move the debate forward whatsoever. And of course they will take us out on the way through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the matter of the convoy, there were a lot of people—Labor supporters—that I spoke to in both Central Queensland and across Queensland after the federal election who said to me: 'Jeez, wasn't that convoy a disaster? Didn't that hurt us?' And it did. It hurt Labor, but, more importantly, it hurt Central Queenslanders. A lot of these Labor supporters who raised this with me said: 'Jeez, the Greens didn't know what they were getting up to, did they? They've ended up delivering another Liberal-National Party government.' You know what? That's exactly what they wanted.</span>

                  </a>  And, as I say, you can see the glee on the Greens' faces at that outcome. They're having a giggle to themselves right now because they actually don't care about progressive reform that takes this country forward, that actually helps poorer people in the community and that delivers real change to the environment. That's why they voted against the CPRS when Kevin Rudd was in government. That's why they're putting up stunts about Newstart in here that have no practical effect whatsoever. They are all about self-indulgent stunts, and the Bob Brown convoy was the best example we could have possibly seen of that. The Greens did not care one iota what impact their actions through the federal campaign in the form of the Bob Brown convoy or anything else had on the election result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw arrogant, self-indulgent behaviour from the Greens before the election—that is, they went around saying they wanted to be a coalition partner and part of the future Shorten Labor government. If you want to talk about people who were measuring up the curtains, it was the Greens. Having lost the election worse than anyone else, they now have the hide to term themselves the official opposition and christen themselves shadow ministers. Well, maybe start by getting a few more members into the House of Representatives let alone the Senate before you start doling out shadow ministries to each other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sick to death of self-indulgent behaviour from the Greens. They have no respect for Queenslanders, for the environment, for jobs, for progressive reform. If they actually cared about those things, they wouldn't have been doing silly stunts through the federal election—and which they continue to do after the election—because all those stunts did was to make sure that that mob over there, the blue team as we call them in my house, stayed where they are. That's why all of us have to stay over here and watch the damage that the blue team—the Liberal and National team—is inflicting on the Australian people and the environment, something you say you care about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People said to me after the election, 'Oh, gee, the Greens were really upset about that.' They were ecstatic. All they really cared about was getting their primary vote up in the state of Queensland. They managed to secure Senator Waters spot back in here and they managed to hang onto all their other senators in the other states across the country. They were very happy with the result of the election. They didn't care what the consequences of their actions were. They never do. All they care about is stunts. They're not actually serious about getting the job done and about driving progressive reform. Sometimes you have to make some compromises along the way in order to get the job done. The reality of winning an election is that you have to get the majority of people to vote for you, not just one small section of the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sooner the Greens wake up to themselves and stop pulling silly stunts that all but guarantee the Liberal and National Party remain in government the better. If you're actually serious about getting a better environmental position, maybe think about getting this mob out of power and maybe think about directing some of your energies at them rather than always at Labor. If you want to keep running people against Labor candidates, as you continue to do, then don't cry about the fact that the Liberals and Nationals win. We are the ones who are taking on this mob and who are putting real, progressive ideas forward that can actually deliver while you're off running silly stunts just to make sure you can continue to draw your salary. That's all the Greens are about. I think most Australians are awake to you. It would be a really nice change if the Greens got in behind some real policy that could actually work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about Newstart momentarily. If the Greens were serious about that, why didn't they get Adam Bandt, the member for Melbourne, to introduce a bill over there? We all know that's where a change to Newstart can actually happen. If you want to bring in a bill to change the rate of Newstart, it's got to start on the other side of the building, in the House of Representatives. You've got a member of parliament over there. His name is Adam Bandt. I know most of you don't like him, but I can introduce you to him sometime. If you were serious about lifting the rate of Newstart, then you would actually have introduced a bill over there rather than pulling another one of your silly stunt motions, like you do every single day. As you very well know, moving a motion here to increase Newstart has no practical effect whatsoever. You get to go and do your silly 'we did it' stunts and memes that you put around the place, but you know what? You don't actually do anything.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only thing you've done is guarantee that the crowd over there is going to keep Newstart low, is going to keep pillaging the environment, is going to keep pushing on the coalmines that you say you don't like and is going to keep discriminating against the people you say you stand for. Well done! 'We did it. We did it. We made sure this government got re-elected.' Well done! Great work! How long are you going to keep up these kinds of stunts that ensure they stay in government forever? I didn't come here to remain on the opposition benches. I know that all of you have no prospect whatsoever of being in government and that you're happy being a little rump up there on your own, passing your silly motions, getting your little social media memes out and having a bit of a giggle amongst yourselves, but the rest of us are actually here to do a real job—to move Australia forward and get wages lifted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know you don't like unions and you don't know many working people, but there are working people out there who actually need a pay rise. You're not doing anything to help them by keeping the Liberals and the Nationals in power. We on this side of the chamber have come here to drive progressive reform, to win government—that concept is a bit alien to the Greens—and to get a majority of people to vote for us so that we can lift wages, reverse penalty rate cuts and bring in real changes that will impact on climate change, lift Newstart and do all the things you say you want to do but which you're completely inept at getting done. The only thing the Greens have demonstrated any ability to do is to ensure the Liberals and Nationals stay in power and to ensure that all the causes they say they care about get nowhere. I hope that they take this onboard. It's probably the best advice they've had for a while. They should have a good listen to it and wake up to themselves.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="192970" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  I want to start by acknowledging that we've got some schoolkids watching today. I want to say hi to them and let them know there are some folk in here who have read the climate science and are actually excited about looking to a clean energy future which has prosperous regions and workers that have sustainable jobs that are going to last.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I'm sorry that the people in here are acting like pork chops. We're on broadcast today, so the whole nation just heard that. It did look like you were enjoying yourself, Senator Watt, and that's nice; we need more joy in all aspects of our lives. But I really don't think people elect us just to stand in here and insult each other. Senator Watt, as a fellow Queenslander, I'm sorry that you used your 10 minutes that way when we could have been talking about the growing police state and the creep of surveillance powers that not only this federal government is pushing through but the opposition in Queensland is also now pushing through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was actually really affronted by the fact that the Queensland police arrested a journalist. They didn't even ask him to move on or give him any warning; they arrested him and his three colleagues yesterday and locked them up. That disturbs me as a Queenslander. It disturbs me that the Queensland police appear to have been hired by Adani. I don't think our police force should be for sale. It wouldn't be the first time that this has happened. I've been seeking clarity on whether money has changed hands for this, because I don't think our police force should be able to be hired by private companies, especially not when they were defending a mine site for which the traditional owners—the Wangan and Jagalingou people—have not given unanimous consent. I was disturbed by that, and that's why our party put forward this MPI today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead we've seen a pretty unedifying pile-on. Again, it's great to self-reflect, and we're happy to listen to your criticism. But we had a minister, the resources minister for the Commonwealth of Australia, spend 10 minutes fixating on the Greens. I don't know about anyone else, but I thought it was a little embarrassing that someone who is in charge of the resources sector just wanted to attack the Greens for 10 minutes. That's great that he thinks we're all-powerful. Word to him: we've got more connection to the community than he evidently has. I also want to take him to task on a statement he made: 'I've been trying to get this coalmine up for years.' So says the regulator, and that tells us everything we need to know about what is wrong with this government. We have ministers who are meant to be regulating an industry, and instead they are just shills for the industry. It's not the first time Minister Canavan has mentioned such matters; it's perfectly clear that he considers himself a representative, a voice, for the mining industry and not a regulator of it. In fact, he said that himself when he resigned from cabinet because of the section 44 issues. I find that very challenging, as someone who believes in a democracy that's meant to work for people, that's meant to be guided by evidence and science, and that's meant to protect the planet going forward. I find it challenging that the resources minister thinks it's his job to promote private interests—in this instance, a multinational coal company that doesn't pay any tax but does donate to the Nationals and previously donated to the Liberals and One Nation. I find it very challenging that the minister thinks that's his role, so I want to take him to task over that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Watt then spoke about the future of Queensland. I'm glad he raised that, because I think that is a useful issue to discuss. I'm really proud that, in the election campaign, my party took to the people. I went many, many times throughout regional Queensland and spoke to many people, including coalminers who spoke to me about their concerns for their health and the long-term future of their industry. They know that the transition is happening, they know that their colleagues are getting sick from black lung disease and they are distraught that no-one else is reading the writing on the wall and planning for that. I was really proud to advocate for our 47½ thousand clean energy jobs, including for those existing coalmine workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want those people to have good, prosperous, long-term, sustainable and healthy jobs. We want to take them hand in hand, as the government should in fact be doing, as the transition occurs. We don't want them to be tossed on the scrap heap as the economy changes and those coal companies just sack workers overnight. Let's be honest: they don't really care about the workers. They're a private company set up for private profits. It's their job to generate money for their shareholders. The workers are clearly not their top priority, but they are the top priority for us. It is our job to care for the safety of our climate for us, our kids and all the other species that we share this planet with and the future of those communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do take a bit of umbrage at the assertion that that is not something that the Greens care about, because, patently, our policies and our campaign were focused around that. I also find it a bit disappointing when people choose to blame election results on random factors, rather than reflecting on their own decisions and their own lack of firm decision on what is quite a divisive issue: the Adani coalmine. I think it's really disappointing that the folks on this side of the chamber, the Labor Party, really did try to have a bet each way and then had the audacity to get cross at the Greens when people who want strong climate action voted for the Greens. I don't want to say anything more pointed than that, because I think we've had enough poor behaviour over this last little bit, and, again, I think people really expect better from us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming back to the MPI today, it's centred around the fact that we saw some really confronting arrests of members of the French press—not even our own media. We've now created an international diplomatic incident because the police force—as I said, I'm checking whether they were paid by Adani, as previous fossil fuel companies have hired the Queensland Police Service before—have arrested members of the free press for simply covering a peaceful protest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to now come to the purpose of those protests, because they came under quite some criticism from the Minister for Resources and Northern Australia, Senator Canavan, who said he's been trying to get the Adani coalmine up for years. He really demonised people who are actually working for the public interest to protect the climate that we all rely on, and I think that's very disappointing—perhaps it's not surprising, given the $5 million in donations from the coal and oil sector that the Liberal Party, the Labor Party and the Nationals have received over the last four years. It seems that money does, in fact, talk. But scientists talk, and this government doesn't listen. The community talks, and this government laughs at them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm afraid these people participating in the protests are going to outlast you, and history will look favourably on their actions. They are taking action to protect our climate, to protect the future economic prosperity of regional Queenslanders and all of our regional economies around the nation, and to protect all of the other species that we inhabit this planet with. They're not doing it out of some sense of private aggrandisement or because of any private profit motive; they are doing it in the public interest. I think they're very brave and very gutsy, and they're now, effectively, being targeted by Adani and the Queensland Police Service for peaceful protest action. History will judge them kindly, and it will reflect on the absence of strong climate policy.</span>

                  </a>  I'll take that interjection by Senator McGrath. I'll take that interjection because this is the same party who have done nothing to give farmers the right to lock the gate to coal seam gas companies and other coal companies. I say that with great dismay because I thought the Nationals were meant to be the party for farmers, and yet they've voted against the landholder rights bills that I have brought into this place since 2011—I think it's been five times now. They've been voted down every time, including by the coalition government and, sadly, by Labor. I really think that you should reflect on your perhaps new-found concern for the sanctity of property rights when you won't even give these lands managers the right to protect the sustainability of their land from rapacious fossil fuel companies. But, again, the fossil fuel companies do make very generous donations, don't they? Maybe they're paying more into your coffers than the agricultural sector previously has? That must be it, because, unfortunately, those people aren't getting the representation they deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't wait to hear what the next speaker's got to say, but I think that we've raised some really important issues here today. We are unapologetically in support of the climate protests that have been underway globally—led by young people and led, often, by young women, which makes me very happy—and that are now coming to our shores, brought by our young people who feel so disenfranchised by this political process and are so aware that so many of the parties in this place have been bought by vested interests and corporate donors. They are taking to the streets, and I think that's incredibly brave of them. History will look upon them as absolute heroes who, at the last minute, tried to do everything they could to make their government aware of what was at stake and to protect their futures. So to the kids who are up there in the gallery, I want to say: please keep your activism up and keep your hope up. We in this place have a duty to represent you, and many of us are trying to do just that.</span>

                  <a href="237920" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STOKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  I rise to speak on the matter of public importance that has been put forward by the Australian Greens party here today. It's their second matter in a row, and it feeds into their propaganda and, as usual, ignores all the facts. But there are bonus points for them today, because not only do they get to stand up and virtue signal on an issue, as they often do, but they have also managed to do a two in one. Today they're going to virtue signal on Adani and on their contrived conception of free speech. They might even get a third one in there if they can manufacture some accusations of police brutality. Shame on the Greens for using this chamber as a vehicle to perpetuate falsehoods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest Adani protest in North Queensland isn't remotely a breach of press freedom, nor is it a return to the days of protests being banned in Queensland. If anything, the Queensland police protected the stopadani.com crowd and ensured that they had a voice and that they could protest safely, despite the fact that they were engaged in dangerous behaviours. These protestors have got a history of doing things which are dangerous. Last month, two of them glued themselves to a crossing on Queen Street in inner-city Brisbane. It is a pretty busy road; police had to stop traffic for hours until the protestors were removed. Who would have thought that inconveniencing pedestrians and commuters was the way to win hearts and minds?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Later last month, another one glued himself—in a canoe, no less—to the Victoria Bridge, a bridge that links inner-city Brisbane to the other business area of South Bank, which gets 11,000 cars a day passing through it. And yesterday the anti-Adani squad showed they're not just reckless but also that they have run out of glue. I couldn't quite believe it when I heard that anti-Adani protesters had locked themselves together and had sat on the rail line leading into the Abbot Point coal terminal. I had to find out if it was true, so I went to the statement put out by the police. It said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Queensland Police Service … arrested seven people following protest activity at a port facility near Bowen this morning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Just after 6am, police responded to reports up to 40 protesters were impeding road and rail access to the Abbot Point Road facility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I'm reading this and thinking, 'Well, it's just another day in paradise for stopadani.com.' The statement went on:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A 28-year-old Victorian man and four male French nationals aged 29, 30, 32 and 39 were charged with one count of trespassing on a railway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Two Victorian women, aged 20 and 22, were charged with one count each of trespassing on a railway, obstruct railway and contravene a police direction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The four French people filming the protest, including a person by the name of Clement, were released on bail on the condition that they didn't go within 20 kilometres of Adani's Carmichael mine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, none of this would have played out as well if the matter of public importance that had been submitted by the Greens today read a little bit more truthfully, along the lines of 'the actions of the Queensland police, in doing their jobs and arresting people and foreign nationals with a video camera, saved people who were trespassing on a railway and potentially going to die if they were left in the way of the train drivers, who were unlikely to see them in time'. I could go on. Are we really surprised that the Greens are turning a blind eye to the issues at hand? This isn't even remotely about press freedom. As far as I know, Mr Clement didn't even have his footage confiscated. So what is important? Jobs are important. So is upholding the letter of the law, and that means not laying false accusations against Queensland police for doing their job and keeping people safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also important to let people go about their business. In Brisbane yesterday, just around the corner from the federal member for Brisbane's office, the anti-Adani protesters blocked a concrete plant's gate and prevented that business's concrete trucks and other vehicles from exiting and entering their own private property. Their plan was to stop trucks from entering or leaving the site until they were arrested. So they willingly broke the law, as their brethren up north had done, and yes, they were arrested after a two-hour stand-off with police. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What earned Meales Concrete Pumping this honour? It was because the company had been contracted to work on the Abbot Point coal terminal. Somehow, in the minds of Greens senators, that gives protesters the licence to ignore whatever laws they please, to stop a business from operating, forcing contract workers to lose valuable income and inconveniencing other businesses who are waiting for concrete to pour for slabs for houses and commercial building and so on. It's hard to imagine that you can sink much lower than these protesters, who forced police to have to ask them to let trucks out because they were needed to get to a nursing home to complete urgent work. There is no level to which they won't stoop. The group later put out a statement saying they had been pressuring Meales Concrete Pumping for weeks to drop their contact with Adani. So it wasn't just a few hours of a media stunt or inconveniencing them for a day; it was bullying them out of their livelihood for weeks. And if they had succeeded they would have ended the livelihoods of every single one of their workers. What a shameful display of behaviour! And these protesters call on other Australians to target other Adani contractors and disrupt their operations, too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So shame on the Greens for endorsing these protesters who think they can take the law into their own hands and take away people's jobs and livelihoods. Shame on the Queensland Premier, too, for her silence on the issue. For weeks the CBD and mining towns have been laid siege to by these extreme climate activists. There hasn't been so much as a raised eyebrow from Premier Palaszczuk. Good on Queensland opposition leader, Deb Frecklington, though, and all of the LNP team, for pushing a bill that will see the book thrown at these people, who conspire to deliberately sabotage legitimate businesses like Meales Concrete Pumping.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a trend from the hard Left to believe that their extreme views are more important than the rights of ordinary Australians to run a business or to live in their home safely. Indeed, it is the increasingly militant actions of animal activists, their invasion of private property in the name of animal rights and their theft and damage to property, that has forced the coalition government to draft legislation to stop extreme animal activists from misusing digital technology to incite other activists to invade private property, trespass and cause disruption and distress to the adults and children working on farms. The Criminal Code Amendment (Agricultural Protection) Bill 2019 introduces new offences for the incitement of trespass, property damage or theft on agricultural land, punishable by up to five years imprisonment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will continue to support Australian farmers, their businesses and, importantly, their families, just as we will continue to defend the right of Australians to work in industrial and mining jobs if they wish to, whether that's on a mine itself, in manufacturing or, indeed, driving a concrete truck. It's a shame that the legislation is needed at all. You'd think these activists would have as much compassion for people as they do for animals. But it just isn't so. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Luckily, Australians are much too switched on to buy this nonsense. For as long as the Greens stand in the way of people's right to earn a living, the coalition will stand up for their right to get to work, to earn a wage, to start a business, to run their farm, to provide for their families, and to do it free from harassment from this antiprogress mob. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:49</span>):  Freedom of press and freedom to protest are fundamental tenets of our democracy. But they are being increasingly trampled on and squeezed by this government. If Senator Stoker is actually interested in facts, these are the facts that you should be really concerned about: that our democratic rights are being trampled on by your government. Yesterday's arrest and charging of a French journalistic team who were filming—that's all they were doing—a protest at the entrance to Adani's Abbot Point facility in North Queensland should be chilling for anyone who supports free and independent press.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea that Queensland Police can issue an order forbidding journalists from going near a mining site is deeply, deeply worrying, but I guess we shouldn't really be surprised. This is the direction that this government and state governments around Australia have been heading down for some time. The level and extent of influence that big business and corporations have on this government and the laws that they make are truly frightening. Thank God for these journalists, who are the constant thorn in the side of powerful industries and corporations that are using and abusing the community and the environment. Whether it be mining companies like Adani, the racing and gambling industry or big businesses that commit wage theft, it is most often brave journalists that shine a light and provide transparency on issues that have been hidden away, that these big corporations don't want anyone to see and that the government is working in partnership with them to put a cloak over.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it should be deeply concerning to all of us that Australia has slipped to 21st position in the 2019 World Press Freedom Index. Reporters Without Borders have noted that migrant detention centres run by government contractors on the islands of Manus and Nauru are in practice inaccessible to journalists and have become news and information black holes. Last year, the government enacted laws that threaten anyone who passes on classified information received from a federal public servant, including publishing it, with jail for up to five years. These are the facts. Recent AFP raids that we have seen on the home of Annika Smethurst and the ABC offices are a blatant, brazen attack on democracy and press freedom. They are an attack on our community and they are an attack on the community's right to know and the community's right to protest. If these unprecedented acts and raids don't ring alarm bells for us then nothing will. And, whether or not they were designed to do so, the result is the intimidation of whistleblowers, of journalists, of news organisations and of the public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that wants to do its dirty work without any scrutiny whatsoever. For whistleblowers in particular, these specific raids are a clear and chilling message that, if you dare to speak up, if you dare to speak to a journalist in the public interest, if you dare to reveal information in public that the public have the right to know, the AFP is going to come after you. And it is the government which sets the direction of the agencies. It is the government that has vastly expanded the reach of police and intelligence agencies. More and more federal and state governments are making us a police state where our freedoms, our civil liberties and our human rights are curtailed, where our democracy is being stifled, where our activities are under surveillance, where our police and intelligence agencies have been given more and yet more powers and where fear and intimidation are tools and tactics that are regularly used to shut down transparency, to shut down questioning and to shut down protests. This is lamentable, this is appalling and this is unacceptable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have always stood for strong freedom of speech, press freedom and the right for the community to protest. We have refused to support laws that expanded the power of intelligence agencies and we have opposed new offences for journalists and whistleblowers for disclosing information. We have warned of the consequences of opening the door to building a surveillance state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Journalism is not a crime. We will not stand by while journalists are attacked and arrested for doing their job. We cannot allow them or their sources to be silenced by a police state, by undemocratic laws, by threats and by intimidation. We must speak up and we will speak up. We must fight for the protections of journalists, for whistleblowers and for our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  I've been in here for the last hour listening to the debate about the protests that have been occurring in Queensland. Regardless of whether you believe they are breaking the law, or you find them abhorrent or frustrating, if you ignore the underlying causes of those protests then you do so at your own peril.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bitter frustration, especially that younger Australians are feeling, towards institutions like this that they feel have completely let them down is manifesting itself in ways that we are seeing—when young Australians feel that they have to glue themselves to a pavement to be heard. It is a sign of desperation, yes. It is a cry for help, yes. But I warn the opposition and Senator Stoker and others who have so easily batted this off as some kind of radical annoyance: this is just the beginning. This is just the beginning of what is coming down the line.</span>

                  </a>  And for you, too, Senator. This is just the beginning, because young Australians and young people all around the world are rising up to have their voices heard, whether it's the Extinction Rebellion or a 15-year-old Swedish schoolgirl who has led a revolution, a global revolution, that has got hundreds and thousands, indeed millions, of mostly young people out to protest about their future and to ask us to do our bit for their future. That's what this is. You can argue all you like about whether it's legal or illegal. You can talk all you want about the surface characteristics of these kinds of movements, but you are ignoring the underlying groundswell of frustration that is coming your way. It is just beginning and it is just building.</span>

I remember being in the bar with the original protesters, and the police and politicians who locked up the protesters and sent them to jail. I saw them all slapping each other on the back, having a beer and just celebrating how bloody good it was that a group of people stood up and fought for that wild river—the area that was then declared World Heritage and voted the world's No.1 whitewater rafting experience. It is a global tourism attraction. And no-one, 30 years later, disagrees that it was the right thing to do. You are on the wrong side of history on that side of the chamber—</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <a href="123072" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator </span>
                </a>
                <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">McDONALD</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:59</span>):  It is with much pride that I stand before you to make my first speech in the Senate. It is an incredible privilege to be elected by Queenslanders to be their voice in the Australian parliament in the Senate, the house that makes the ultimate determination on the passage of legislation. I take my seat in this chamber not because of any quota and not because of any faction. I do not believe in identity politics, because that leaves behind people who do not share that same identity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been elected as a senator for Queensland courtesy of a party that preselects on merit, and courtesy of Queenslanders who endorse that principle. I thank Queenslanders for entrusting me with the ultimate responsibility of representing our state, from Camooweal to the Cooper and Cooktown to Coolangatta. I will work tirelessly returning the faith they've placed in both me and the Liberal-National Party. Like so many in this chamber, I've been selected by a party—in my case, the LNP—to stand on its behalf. I chose to stand before its membership, and I asked for the opportunity to be their voice as their candidate on the Senate ticket. They entrusted me with that privilege, and for that I say to all the LNP members: thank you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is an island nation, and I am from the big country. I'm a Cloncurry woman. I'm moulded from the red dirt of north-west Queensland. The minerals run in my veins and the blue sky fills my eyes. I've grown from two families that have given their lives to the north of Australia. On my mother's side: from my grandmother comes the practicality of a bush nurse and a long line of organising woman; and a grandfather who started his mining career with candles and finished by building the most modern mine known in the world at Mount Isa. Tough but fair, my grandfather's proudest achievement was ensuring affordable housing was accessible to workers so they could make their home in Mount Isa, because people matter. People from 43 different nations came from all over the world and, with a tough-minded optimism, forged a new life in north-west Queensland. On my father's side: from my grandmother came harbourmasters; and my grandfather's line of generations of cattle production, from Tasmania to South Australia—and, finally, in the 1860s they called Queensland home.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian agricultural industry will always remain close to my heart, and in this place I'll continue to promote the industry's credentials, particularly around the right to farm and sustainability, and protect it from poorly informed activism born from the growing city-country divide. I come from the land, from a family that prioritised the importance of being a part of our community and understanding the land we live on; that balanced business commitments and our family commitments. I've lived the life of a child, a student, an accountant, a butcher, a mother, an employee and an employer. Thanks to my father, I can block up a bullock, crack a stockwhip and strain a fence. Thanks to my mother, I can cook for a stock camp and balance work with family, and know the value of being a community volunteer. I was educated by School of the Air and distance education and boarded at a school that was founded by the Sacre Coeur society in the 1800s to educate young women. I have degrees in commerce and economics from the University of Queensland.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">But as a child I walked through the cemeteries of ghost towns like Kuridala and Kajabbi, Ballara and Selwyn, and I read the gravestones of children who'd died of disease and young men killed in accidents. With a strange blend of sadness and admiration, I marvelled at how tough their lives were. My grandfathers taught me that the difference between these country towns and the cities was not that great. Both had the modern facilities of their times: ice-makers, generators, hospitals and hotels. They taught me that families like my Scottish forebears, like the Chinese miners and market gardeners and the Afghan traders and camel drivers, all came to the regions because the opportunities were the same or better than those of the cities. Opportunity was available and there was a fair go for those that had a go.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">For if the cities are the head and the nervous system of our national body, regional, rural and remote Australia are the heart and the soul, the guts and the arteries of that body. It is regional, rural and remote Australia that provided our uniqueness that shapes our character and culture; that gave us Anzacs marching off to war from country towns; of laconic farmers and dusty fettlers; of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians being joined by men and women from every nation on earth, and being joined in a common purpose: to build a future for them and their families. Not only is regional and rural Australia the heart and soul, it's the economic backbone, with just one-third of our population contributing more than 30 per cent of our GDP and often on an uneven playing field. Imagine if that playing field became more fair. Realising the true bold potential of the regions is in all Australians' interests, and I pledge to be unashamedly relentless in pursuit of this goal. From the regions we generate energy, harvest our food and fibre, extract our resources and grow the young people who go on to lead our nations in sport and companies and urban communities, and these bright and impressive people are our sorely needed dreamers—they see the challenges but also the opportunities. I will use my time in this place to ensure our regional and rural young people receive their own opportunities to benefit Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Challenges are a good thing. They give us the most innovative thinking in the world, driving scientific achievement and world-leading advances in agriculture, mining, medicine and communications. Qantas was born when two men, Hudson Fysh and Paul McGinness, were surveying air strips for the first England-to-Australia air race in 1921. They helped local grazier Fergus McMaster fix the broken axle on his car on the banks of the Cloncurry River. Together, they dreamed of an aerial service that would beat the tyranny of distance and connect regional Australia. At the age of 87, Alexander Kennedy, another Cloncurry cattleman, was the first fare-paying passenger when Qantas flew from Longreach to Cloncurry in November 1922. The ashes of this man rest at a memorial at Devoncourt, the place that would become my childhood home.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Qantas was established to liberate regional people from the tyranny of distance, to embrace the new technology of flight, to make regional Australia an easier place to live, and to provide for opportunity to the businesses and families living away from the capitals. In the same era was Reverend John Flynn, whose Australian inland medical team established the first flying doctor base in Cloncurry, with the first flight taking off in May 1928. In doing so, our huge remote island nation was provided with arguably the largest mantle of safety in the world.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1960, again in Cloncurry, the first School of the Air lessons were broadcast by Miss Bridget 'Bid' O'Sullivan to provide education to the children of our remote communities. She laid the foundations for Mrs Seccombe and Mrs McGrath, two of my School of the Air teachers, to teach everything from debating skills through to how to play the recorder, all over the air—and for one of those skills I am grateful!</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">These inventions and institutions survive and flourish today because they have in their hearts something unique and important—a connection to our remote and regional spirit of ingenuity and innovation—and they have at their core that people matter. Through these services as a child, I benefited from the imagination and foresight of others and, as an adult, as a senator, that imagination and foresight will inspire me, it will guide me and it will drive me.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't come to this chamber viewing governance through the prism that Australia is or ever should be two parts—the cities and the smaller regions—and both subject to different standards; instead, I come into this chamber knowing that a successful Australia is one big country. The federal party room I sit in, the Nationals, is the greatest champion of Australia being one big country, a big country where all people need secure, reliable and affordable water, electricity, services, communications and transport.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This big country needs dreamers, giants who imagine more, not less, who understand that a great place to live is where people are successful and where communities are prosperous. Successful communities are resourced to look after their environment and their people because people matter. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, these opportunities—the evenness of advantage between bush and cities, between regional and urban—began to diverge somewhere, by my best reckoning, in the 1990s. It was a time of productivity commissions and user pays. It was the time that the ground cracked, and the chasm that divided regional communities and urban places began. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">That gap has widened to the point that something dramatic needs to happen to revitalise the heart and the soul of our nation: to draw our people home. We need a whole-of-nation approach, a genuine partnership between council, state and federal government that restores the services, the infrastructure and the people back to our regional, rural and remote areas. We need bold economic policy, including taxation zones and rebates, that incentivises businesses and people to escape the urban congestion of our cities and build successful, people focused businesses in our regions. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In one big country, decentralisation shouldn't just be a policy of government. It should be the business of government, entrenched across the political divide as the natural way of government. I've seen governments remove services and justify it with the argument of falling populations: a maternity service closing, railway sidings pulled up and words like 'mothballed' introduced to the government vocabulary. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, when it comes to the cities and there is an inadequate population to ensure public transport is affordable, suddenly billions of dollars in annual subsidies are provided. And that's good. That shouldn't be begrudged, because that is the role of government. But when it comes to rural health services, to the education of kids and to building significant infrastructure, government must not turn around with the calculator and a balance sheet in hand and say that an inadequate population makes these crucial growth services uneconomical. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing this week, and we mustn't forget that in the lead-up to 1969 this too seemed too bold an idea, too impossible a task, but look at where we are today—the space sector in Australia is worth $3.9 billion and employs more than 10,000 people and we're looking at using space data to map water in agriculture. To our people in 1969, I'm sure this seemed an impossible task, but we in this place must remember we are masters of our own destiny—not chained to the past, but invested in the future. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We must walk the talk on decentralisation—we must place government services and vacancies for transport and water, for mines and environment, for health and education in places close to these activities and ask ourselves not 'Why?' but 'Why not?' By focusing on genuine decentralisation, we can deploy investment in infrastructure to drive the diversification of enterprise to the regions. We must work in partnership with local and state government and with industry on the roads, the electricity web, the telecommunications technology, the aviation networks and the rail connections that unify all Australians in one big country. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In the regions, we rely on roads and airports. And there is no moral reason why it should cost more to fly from one of our capital cities to one of our regional towns than it does to fly overseas. In our big country, it is timely that we review our aviation industry and ask, 'Why does it not flourish?' </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We can build the water infrastructure. Water is the building block of life—human, agriculture, food production and community. Without water, frankly, we die. But Australia is unique. We have many great river systems but, unlike other continents, they only run with water seasonally. It is time we focus our ingenuity on capturing some of these flows. Because if we do not capture water, we cannot manage water and manage it to smooth the climate variations of our land. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many water projects that are available to us that provide water storage and management close to suitable land, to communities and to transport. To my mind, these are the development of a network of micro dams at Big Rocks Weir, Charters Towers, Emu Swamp Dam, Stanthorpe, Hughenden Irrigation Scheme project, Cave Hill Dam, Cloncurry, Rookwood Weir, Rockhampton, Lakeland Irrigation Area Project and Hells Gate in North Queensland. It is beyond comprehension that any town in Australia should run out of water in this day and age. I'm committed to seeing well-paid regional jobs in water science for our young people to keep them and bring them home, and to seeing mining engineers educated in Australian universities. Last year saw only 10 mining graduates from the University of Queensland, and our mining expertise is now being grown overseas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we're living through the greatest period of change ever seen in this world. The rate of innovation and digital capacity, both in hardware and software, is putting extraordinary pressure on people to adapt, but at the same time it is opening the greatest ever opportunities for more skills and more services to be delivered remotely by remote dwellers. In Australia we have a wonderful 'unfair advantage' in this space. As a nation used to enormous climate variability, to huge distances and to the challenges of being an exporting nation in a region and a world hungry for our produce, Australia has batted well above its weight in the introduction of modern technology based solutions to extreme challenges. We can better utilise the capacity of the CSIRO for critical investment, both publicly and privately, in science. Research investment is currently underprioritised, and many of our brightest are forced to search for research funding every year. We can unleash the capability of the regions. Better internet connectivity will make living and working regionally both possible and affordable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">One of Australia's greatest female leaders, Mary MacKillop, said, 'You teach more by example than by word.' So in this term I will be regionally focused in my actions and in my words. I will seek innovation and will support legislation that provides a framework for opportunity and growth for our people, because it is people that matter. For I believe in Australia, in our regions and in our people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I must turn to those who believed in me. I've had the joy of working with butchers and the broader team at Super Butcher and of meeting families of every description that I am honoured were our customers. As a retail business operator with the perfect job, of providing the best of Australian meat and meals to families, I do know the sleepless nights and the daily competition of competing for the ever scarce dollars of discerning and busy Australians. I know the responsibility and, often, stress that comes with ensuring your employees get their weekly pay cheques and with paying your bills, often to other small-business owners who share the same stresses. But, better, I know the satisfaction of building and developing a team of exceptional people. To Danny, Lisa, Simon, Dallas, Mat, Chanel, Mitch, Teagan, Bryce and Scott, to Joel, Joe, Jagath, Warren and Jaden and all the team at Super Butcher: I will miss you. You each taught me something important that I will bring in to this chamber.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">My style and personality may be vastly different, but I also follow in the footsteps of outgoing LNP senator Barry O'Sullivan. Like the current Nationals Senate team in this chamber, he has taught me something about the importance of keeping a laser focus on the policies and actions that affect the daily lives of regional Australians, such as his relentless championing of the royal commission into the banks and the practices that it exposed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">But the people who have taught me the most, moulded me the most, championed me the most, believed in me the most and, alas, on occasion, had to chastise me or console me the most are my family. Like others giving a first speech, I am blessed that so many of my family have joined me in the gallery. I can't put into a single speech what each and every one of them means to me. No length of speech and no number of glowing adjectives would do them justice. My mother and father have been extraordinary in their support, and for that I am very grateful; your example has been an inspiration to me. This year they celebrate 50 years of marriage. My two sons, Hamish and George, are here today. My daughter, Lucy, can't be here today—it's the first day of a new semester of university for her. I'm proud that they have listened when I have told them that they need to show up every day, work hard and be ready to put their hand up for opportunity when it comes. We need more women in leadership in business and politics, and I believe the pathway is preparing and training a new generation so they are prepared, confident and chosen for their skills, not for their gender. My children know that they mean the world to me, and on every bill I vote on I will be mindful of what it means to their generation. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">To my brothers, Zanda and James, we grew up together in an isolated place. We were classmates and workmates. We played together as kids and adults. You are my best friends. I love you and thank you both. Jim, I'm so happy you can be here today, along with my cousins Sophie and Marijke. Zanda, although you're not here to see me make this speech today, you still continue to guide my actions as I hear your voice. To Julie, Zanda's wife, thank you. Like all my family, you are an inspiration and a source of strength. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">To the Queensland LNP Senate team of Paul Scarr, Gerard Rennick, Ian Macdonald, Amanda Camm and Nicole Tobin, the campaign meant many hours on the road, speeches and late nights, and your good humour, support and hard work made the last year a pleasure. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">To the many members of the LNP who volunteer their time over countless hours, thank you. As a party member for 30 years, I value your commitment of time and energy to our shared values enormously. There are too many people to name you all, but a special thank you to Jane McNamara, Ron Bird, Beth Honeycombe, Vicki Howard and Rod Johannsen for being particularly helpful. To Tim Fischer and Lawrence Springborg, thank you for your leadership. Thank you for being here for this first speech. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The time is now to realise the full potential of this country for all Australians. It is the time to bridge this divide and secure our nation's future prosperity. Like Pastor Basil King, I urge that we go at it boldly. You'll find unexpected forces closing round and coming to your aid, because Australians matter. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <a href="264449" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHANDLER</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:28</span>):  First of all, I would like to congratulate you, Mr President, on your re-election to your position in the 46th Parliament. The chair in which you now sit is one that has a proud history and, particularly, a recent history of being occupied by fellow Tasmanians. While you don't quite fit that moniker, given that you hail from the great and neighbouring state of Victoria I suppose I can accept that's the next best thing!</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In making my first speech today, I wish to put on record what an honour and a privilege it is to be standing here in the Australian parliament as a senator for Tasmania. In coming to this place I intend to be a fierce advocate for my state, which has already provided me with so many opportunities in life. I wouldn't be here if I weren't passionate about my state and my country, and today I hope to avail upon honourable senators just what drives and motivates me to create better outcomes for both Tasmanians and Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania may only be a small island but it is certainly a diverse one, with more than 60 per cent of our population living outside the capital city of Hobart. To put this in perspective: Queensland is the only other state where more people live outside the capital city than in it, and even then it's still a narrower split. Representing both of these regions—the city and the country—and, in doing so, ensuring that Tasmania as a whole becomes stronger, is a challenge that a Tasmanian senator must undertake with enthusiasm.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Standing here today, I must attest I feel well equipped to deal with this challenge because my parents, who are both here today, represent a harmonious pairing of both. My father, Robert, grew up in Hobart, where my grandfather worked as a stockbroker. The Chandler family has lived in and around Hobart for generations, ever since my great-great-great grandfather, William Chandler, planted the first garden at Tasmania's Government House. Meanwhile, my mother, Michelle, was raised in Oatlands, in the heart of the agricultural Midlands, where her family owned a farm at Parattah. When it came time to start their own family, my parents chose to give my sister, Sophie, and me the best of the two worlds that they'd both experienced, settling at a hobby farm in the Huon Valley, a rural area only half an hour south of Hobart. Dad worked locally, at a regional office of the Tasmanian department of primary industries, as an animal health officer, eventually branching into aquacultural health as the local salmon industry boomed. Mum, on the other hand, was a midwife at the Royal Hobart Hospital.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Growing up in the Huon, I learnt what it was like to live in a small but resilient community. That resilience was put to the test only a few months ago when the hills around the valley were alight with bushfire. I spent time in the Huon during this period, including with our Prime Minister, surveying relief efforts and speaking with locals about how they were coping in the face of tragedy. It was inspiring—although not surprising to me as a Huon girl—to see this community come together so positively at a time of adversity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">My upbringing wasn't a particularly political one. Perhaps it was because both Mum and Dad were public servants and viewed impartiality as fundamental to their professional livelihood that, at the age of eleven, when I inquired with them who they'd voted for in the 2001 federal election, they responded that it wasn't polite to ask such a question or even talk about politics too much. Clearly, I didn't take their advice on that point.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">What my parents did instil in me, however, was a sense that it's important to know what's going on in the world and to have perspectives on those issues. Dinnertime was spent watching the news across three different TV channels, talking about what was reported and, usually in my case, asking questions about what it all meant. I doubt there are many other 29-year-olds who remember as vividly as I do Paul Keating as Prime Minister or the republic referendum or the introduction of the GST.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Having a somewhat precocious awareness of current affairs was one thing, but it wasn't until my year 6 Canberra trip that I become truly enchanted with the history of the great representative institution that is this place and the power of our Australian democracy. At my old school, St. Michael's Collegiate, this visit to our nation's parliament was an annual tradition, the culmination of many weeks of civics education, led by the wonderful Mrs Beth Darcey. We were taught about the House of Representatives and the Senate, and our lessons were even so technical as to explain the different voting systems used for each. It was undoubtedly quite a feat for Mrs Darcey to keep 12-year-old girls interested in such complex subject matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It might seem a little cliche to mention the profound impact a primary school excursion had on my political bearings, but I tell this story for a reason. In providing us a robust civics education, Mrs Darcey recognised the need to explain to my class that political parties exist, that at that point in time the Liberal Party was in government and that at other points in time the Labor Party had been in government, but never did she feel a need to impose upon us her own political views. In this country, I believe we've shied away from educating young people about our democracy because we're afraid we won't be able to teach them without being inherently political. My experience, however, is that it is absolutely possible to provide the next generation with a comprehensive civics education that maintains an appropriate level of impartiality. As a person who was inspired through my own education to learn more about our parliament and our democracy, and who has eventually ended up elected to serve my state in this place, I think we owe it to the future success of our democracy to ensure children understand and value our political institutions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">While this history explains my interest in politics generally, it was the defeat of the Howard government in late 2007 that specifically drew me to the Liberal Party. So much of the spirit and vision of Howard and Costello resonated with me—a sense of pride in our country, the idea of reward for effort, responsible budget management, equality of opportunity, growth and prosperity. I remember feeling so disappointed to see that spirit and vision relegated to the history books, I thought, at least, before its time.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It wasn't long after this, while studying law and political science at the University of Tasmania, that I first became involved in Liberal politics. I joined the local liberal students club in my very first week of university and the Young Liberals not long thereafter. I'm proud to stand here in this chamber today still just young enough to qualify as a member of my local Young Liberal branch. Through the Young Liberals, I was afforded countless opportunities to meet other like-minded people across the country, a number of whom are here observing this speech today, a couple of whom I now have the privilege of serving with in this chamber and many of whom I hope one day will join me as colleagues here or in another parliament.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It was in the Young Liberals that I made the political friendships that I know will last a lifetime. Through these friendships, I was eventually elected President of the Tasmanian Young Liberals at the age of 24, and President of the Federal Young Liberals at the age of 25. I cannot understate the profound impact the Young Liberals had on my political development, both in terms of exposing me to different ideas and perspectives grounded in our liberal and conservative philosophies, and also in terms of the support I was given and the confidence I found as I took on more senior roles within the party. The Young Liberal movement has an integral role to play as the philosophical conscience of our party, both supporting elected members but also keeping us true to our values. Having made the evolution from Young Liberal to Senator, I look forward to those tables now being turned!</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Given my involvement in youth politics, it is perhaps not surprising to anyone in this chamber that my overwhelming motivation in running for the Senate was to fight for the best opportunities for future generations—for all Australians, but particularly for young Tasmanians. On almost every key indicator, Tasmania is a stronger, more prosperous, and confident state since the election of federal Liberal governments in 2013, 2016 and now in 2019. These results were complemented, and outcomes for our state greatly enhanced, by the election of state Liberal governments led by Will Hodgman in 2014 and 2018. Despite these improvements, the unfortunate reality is each year we see too many young Tasmanians leaving our state to study or in the early stages of their career. Sometimes they do so in order to broaden their horizons, and that's certainly not something I think should be discouraged. But more often than not, they leave to pursue opportunities interstate which they can't enjoy at home; and many, who would have had so much to offer Tasmania, don't return.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I consider myself so fortunate to have lived in Tasmania all my life. After university, I commenced my career in the private sector at Deloitte in Hobart, where I was still working until my election to this place. I want all young Tasmanians to have the same chance I had to remain on our island, build a career and stay close to those all-important familial and social connections. To do this, we need to embrace the industries in which we have a competitive advantage and grow these industries to provide more local employment opportunities. I am confident that our government has a strong plan to achieve this. For example, there is still significant room for growth in the Tasmanian agricultural sector, and I'm thrilled that our government has committed $100 million to invest in new irrigation schemes across the state. It's often not appreciated by non-Tasmanians that many parts of our state often do and currently are experiencing drought conditions. Just like everywhere else in the country, new irrigation schemes offer greater security for farmers and will support many to increase production or branch out into new crops. With Tasmanian produce highly regarded both nationally and internationally, this is a sensible, job-creating investment for our government to be making.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also a strong supporter of our tourism industry, particularly the opportunities it provides to regional parts of Tasmania. Even more exciting is seeing the significant number of young people setting up tourism ventures in our state. Again, our government is supporting tourism in regional Tasmania with significant investments in visitor infrastructure at Cradle Mountain and the Freycinet Peninsula—both critical assets for key tourism destinations on the north-west and the east coast respectively. We're also expanding the potential of our offshore aquaculture industry with a $70 million investment in the Blue Economy Cooperative Research Centre, to be based in Launceston, and delivering a new forestry hub in northern and north-western Tasmania as part of our $12.5 million investment in nine hubs across the country. And for me, the most exciting prospect for investment and job creation in Tasmania is the plan supported by this government to expand Tasmania's long heritage in hydroengineering through the Battery of the Nation pumped hydro plans. This project has the potential to employ thousands of Tasmanians and create billions in investment, while also delivering lower power prices and enhanced energy security for the state and the nation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania is truly the turn-around state. Our economy is growing, more people are in work, and Tasmania's global reputation as a premium tourism destination and producer of fine food and wine has never been stronger. I am confident that with increasing investment in our state and governments that are supportive and encouraging of that investment, perhaps the next generation of Tasmanians after me and the generations after that will have the best of opportunities at home rather than having to move to the mainland.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it is of great concern to me that as soon as Tasmania begins to do well in any industry there are forces from vocal minorities—usually, the green Left of politics—that move in to shut down progress and chase away investment. We need more jobs but we have green groups harassing tourism proponents who put forward plans for new developments and experiences. We need more housing; but the local council in our capital city consistently refuses to approve new housing and accommodation projects, on the basis of aesthetics.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Even our traditional industries—the industries for which Tasmania has an internationally renowned reputation, which have supported hardworking families for decades—are not immune from this hypervigilantism. Our aquaculture industry, which has contributed significant jobs and investment in the Huon Valley, where I grew up, is constantly under attack by the green movement. Our forestry industry is still attempting to rebuild after being deliberately decimated by the former state and federal Labor-Green governments. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">To top it off, earlier this month I picked up the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercury</span> newspaper to see an opinion piece by Bob Brown, opposing a wind farm planned for Robbins Island in north-west Tasmania. These supposed champions of renewable energy are opposed to wind farms, just like they were opposed to hydrodams, because there might be dollars and jobs in it for Tasmanians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems that wherever there is opportunity and success in Tasmania, the anti-everything brigade are quickly on the scene, determined to stop progress at all costs. Ironically, it's those who like to call themselves 'progressive' who are always at the forefront of these efforts to prevent progress. And their weapon of choice is always misinformation and hyperbole; for expressing my support for new tourism opportunities in our regions and wilderness areas, I am sure at some point in the near future I'll be accused by the usual suspects of wanting to build casinos in national parks, turn Hobart into New York, and transform Freycinet into Majorca.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Growing up in the beautiful Huon Valley, nobody appreciates more than I do what makes Tasmania special and unique, and a great place to live. But it's a completely false dichotomy to pretend that the only way to protect our lifestyle and our environment is to oppose all forms of development and progress. The quiet majority of Tasmanians understand that, and that's what they have consistently voted for since 2013. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why it is so pleasing that for at least another three years—and I hope many more—we have Liberal governments, both in Canberra and Tasmania, who will stand up against these efforts to stop progress, and support sensible and necessary economic growth in Tasmania. I certainly look forward to doing my part to advocate to that effect, for my state, in this place.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming from Tasmania, where our education outcomes have historically been the lowest of any Australian state, it is perhaps not surprising that education is a policy area particularly close to my heart. Ten years ago, less than half of our children were completing year 12 with a Tasmanian Certificate of Education. Fortunately, since the election of the Hodgman Liberal government in 2014, our state's key education indicators have improved substantially, not the least because that government has commenced extending every public high school to include year 11 and 12. This policy has corrected a historical anomaly in our education system which no doubt has contributed to many children over the years ceasing their education entirely when finishing high school at the end of year 10. Education is the foundation upon which we build our lives, and I believe every child, in Tasmania and across the country, should have the opportunity of a great education. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond attainment rates, I believe the next challenge for our education system in Australia, and particularly in Tasmania, is ensuring that our education and training providers teach our young people the right skills to support them in gaining long-term employment. Education should be holistic, and not solely focused on the theoretical, but also the more practical skills that equip students for the workplace. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">While the basics of literacy and numeracy are incredibly important, I worry that our next generation of educated jobseekers will be capable of writing perfectly eloquent and rigorously researched essays but might struggle to solve the complex problems our society faces with a practical, human, commonsense approach. I'm not saying a tertiary qualification is pointless, but I do believe government has a key role to play in ensuring our universities are providing a quality, practical education to our young people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Another challenge that faces our educational sector, and particularly our universities, is the steady decline of academic freedom and diversity of thought on campus. When I was involved in campus politics while at university, I was acutely aware of the contrast my views presented to the majority of students, and indeed lecturers, around me. I recall in one political science tutorial, my lecturer expressed disbelief when I pointed out what I thought were the drawbacks to union power in collective workplace bargaining. Worse, perhaps, was the dismissive response I received from a fellow student, who rejected my perspective on the basis that I was 'just a Young Liberal'. Surely universities should encourage the consideration and debate of a range of views—not dismiss certain perspectives out of hand while endorsing other views without scrutiny.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I consider my experience as a conservative on campus was an intellectual challenge that only strengthened my beliefs in the liberal cause. Since my time at university, however, it appears that left-wing activism and groupthink has only increased at the expense of genuine and free academic inquiry. We are living in a country where universities are shutting down debate—for example, by charging exorbitant security fees when certain speakers, generally with viewpoints that differ from predominantly left-wing academics, wish to share their perspectives on campus.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This progressive shutdown of academic freedom, at least to my mind, is at best not in the spirit and at worst in complete contravention of the Higher Education Support Act, which seeks to 'support a higher education system that promotes and protects free intellectual inquiry'. Indeed, the act dictates that universities should implement policies to uphold such inquiry. More must be done to ensure that our higher-education institutions are complying with these basic requirements, if only because no student's views should ever be dismissed in class purely on the basis of their political affiliation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be no surprise to honourable senators that I come to this place feeling so strongly about personal freedoms, because as a Liberal they form the fundamental tenets of our ideology. As a Liberal, I believe in the innate worth of the individual, reward based on merit and the encouragement of personal responsibility for one's actions. I believe in small and responsible government that doesn't overreach its influence in our everyday lives and that clearly defines its limits where it might infringe on the rights of its citizens, keeping in mind that such infringements should be few and far between. I believe in a federal system of government that decentralises its decisions to the local level wherever possible and that distributes the economic benefits of government spending and employment throughout regional areas—something I would like to see more of in Tasmania. I strongly believe that every Australian should be free to voice their opinions and engage in the marketplace of ideas in a respectful manner, free from government interference.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I outline these beliefs here today not only because they are beliefs which will guide my decision-making in this place but also because they are beliefs worth fighting for, right now more than ever. In the last decade we have seen example upon example of personal freedoms, and particularly free speech, being stifled in this country. Everyday Australians want to be free to live their lives without anyone, and particularly not government, policing them in terms of what they should think, say or believe.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">True freedom of speech means the right to express your views, and the right of others to respond and say that they find your views ridiculous, but not to run off to some authority and take action against you on the basis of disagreement. The vitality of our democracy and our success as a nation are contingent on maintaining a population that is free to express, to work and to achieve. If we as a government impede those freedoms, we do so based on a false premise that we know better or, worse, that we distrust the very electors who put us here. As elected representatives, we should never be so arrogant as to assume we are best placed to determine the direction of people's lives. Our role, I believe, is to work wherever possible only to create the conditions where individuals can flourish for the betterment of our nation.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">As I'm sure my colleague senators would appreciate, the journey to this place is neither easy nor straightforward and never possible without the support, friendship and encouragement of others. There are a number of people here today and back home who have all helped in some way towards my own personal journey here, and, while I cannot possibly list them all, there are some I would like to mention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I wouldn't be in this place if it weren't for the endorsement and encouragement I've received from the Tasmanian Division of the Liberal Party, and for that I am continually grateful. Thank you particularly to our party's president, Geoff Page; treasurer, Rod Scurrah; and state director, Sam McQuestin. Our organisation is stronger for your leadership. To the rest of the Tasmanian federal Liberal members and senators, our staff and particularly my newly formed team: I look forward to working alongside you to achieve great things for our state.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">To all those I've worked with at Deloitte in Hobart, and in particular to my amazing former boss, Elizabeth Lovett: thank you for the professional challenges and encouragement you've provided to me over the last five years. I've been so fortunate to have a number of mentors who have all helped and encouraged me in my political endeavours, and I would like to thank Premier Will Hodgman; the member for Boothby, Nicolle Flint; Senator Jonno Duniam; and Senator James Paterson for their invaluable advice and guidance.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I must also thank the many current and former Young Liberals who have been so integral in supporting me on my journey to this place—Simon Breheny, Mark Briers, Candice Burch MLA, Lauren Callahan, Josh Manuatu, Adam McKee, Evan Mulholland, Raylene Pearce, Alyssa Royters, Liam Staltari and Jocelyn Sutcliffe.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to make special mention of my two longest and greatest friends in the Liberal Party, Christian Street and Bec Dunham. I wouldn't be standing here today if it weren't for you. To Katherine, Rhiannon, Victoria and Alex: thank you for keeping me grounded and giving me a taste of normality. I suspect I will be needing that in even stronger doses now. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">To my family—my parents, Robert and Michelle; my sister, Sophie, and her husband, Keaton; my grandmother Jan—and my extended family, the Chandlers, Bakers and Edwardses: thank you for listening to my political monologues at the dinner table and, more importantly, for challenging those monologues at the opportune time. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">To my husband, Chris Edwards: there aren't many couples who spend their first six months of marriage on the campaign trail. I'm so appreciative of your love and support. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">To the people of Tasmania, who have elected me as their senator, I save the greatest gratitude for last. You have bestowed upon me an immense honour, one that I promise today that I will never take for granted. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In his Forgotten People speech Sir Robert Menzies said: </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">If the new world is to be a world of men, we must be not pallid and bloodless ghosts, but a community of people whose motto shall be, 'To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.'</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last six years Tasmania has flourished to become a state that I believe is truly emblematic of the motto. I look forward to promoting that sense of achievement and endeavour and proudly seeing Tasmania progress from strength to strength in this place. I thank the Senate. </span>

This model closely resembles provisions in the United Kingdom’s TEO scheme. The Government considers this approach appropriately balances independent oversight of the scheme with operational requirements in an international and dynamic threat environment. The new provisions will provide that the Minister can make a TEO which comes into effect immediately and without a reviewing authority’s permission if the Minister reasonably considers it necessary due to the urgency of the matter, provided that: the reviewing authority reviews the TEO as soon as reasonably practicable, and if the reviewing authority decides the decision is flawed, the TEO will not be valid. The reviewing authority will not review the conditions set out in a return permit.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a lacking response from the government, and in particular from the Minister for Home Affairs. The Labor Party and the Liberals have already come together in agreeing to support the temporary exclusion laws subject to the 18 substantive recommendations made by the bipartisan Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. We need to remember that this is a Liberal-dominated committee chaired by Liberal MP Mr Hastie. Given this, the government have always had the final say and control over what the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security are going to be. Labor has respected this fact because the committee has worked in a collegial fashion with the shared aim of improving legislation. This is what we as parliamentarians are expected to do, and it is in fact what we are paid to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's response shows that of the 18 recommendations made by the bipartisan committee the government has implemented only 16. That's the government's response. I contend, and Labor contends, that that is not the case, but I am going to come back to that in a moment. By the government's own standards, that they have only implemented 16 of the 18 recommendations, they have failed to implement two of the bipartisan committee's recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an unprecedented move by this government. Since 2013, the government has not explicitly rejected a recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. The PJCIS has operated for years to achieve bipartisanship on national security legislation. We have worked together, as parliamentarians should, to improve national security legislation. Labor has strived to work in such a fashion since Bob Hawke established the first iteration of the committee to oversee Australia's intelligence services in 1986. The cooperative value of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to reach consensus and improve national security legislation has afforded significant benefit to our national security agencies and Australians alike. It is a record of which the parliament should be proud.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given their response, the government has rejected the recommendations of its own members, including in this place Senator Abetz, Senator Fawcett and Senator Stoker. The government's own response says that they have not accepted recommendations from a Liberal-dominated committee. Committee members in this place, Senator Abetz, Senator Fawcett and Senator Stoker, have had their recommendations explicitly rejected by their government in their government's response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government would have you believe that they have implemented 16 of the 18 recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, that is not the case. Instead of agreeing to and implementing all 18 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's substantive recommendations, the government has in fact rejected four of them, only partially implemented another six and ignored one recommendation completely—to produce Solicitor-General's advice that shows and assures Australians that this legislation is constitutionally valid. Further to this, there are now new provisions in this legislation which the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security has never considered. The government has opened up a Pandora's box of loose legislative drafting by jeopardising and politicising the work of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The revised temporary exclusion order legislation before the parliament is substantially different to the legislation introduced in February, substantially different to the recommendations made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, and substantially different again to the United Kingdom legislation to which Mr Dutton, the Minister for Home Affairs, so frequently refers. This, in fact, includes new questions about the bill's constitutionality as well as loopholes which could result in a legal challenge. To address these concerns, last night I wrote to the Minister for Home Affairs asking for this legislation to be referred back to the PJCIS to consider these matters. I want these concerns to be addressed, and I believe and Labor believes they can be addressed swiftly. This referral is not a delaying tactic or politicking; it is to ensure that we have a temporary exclusion order regime that works, that keeps Australians safe and that is constitutional.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to highlight that this legislation, which is due to come before the Senate this week, applies to a small cohort of people overseas. The government has not been forthcoming with the public about the number of people to whom this scheme will apply. I have seen members of the government, including the Liberal chair of the PJCIS, Mr Andrew Hastie, claim that there is an operational imperative to pass this legislation. While I agree and Labor agrees with the intent of this legislation, one has to ask, given that the United Kingdom has had a similar scheme in place since 2015, why the government has not explained why it has taken the Minister for Home Affairs four years to introduce a similar scheme in Australia. Yesterday, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Cormann, said that the government was 'working through national security legislation as quickly as possible'. When he was asked why the government has taken four years to replicate the UK scheme here in Australia, he said, 'We are working through this legislation as quickly as possible.' Given the threat of foreign fighters returning to Australia, given that 40 people have already returned to Australia, given that the UK implemented this scheme in 2015, how can Australians look at a four-year delay by this government and say, 'That is as quickly as possible'? Is that actually working to keep Australians safe? Would the Minister for Home Affairs or his representative in this chamber be willing to say he was working as quickly as possible when it has taken them four years to introduce the temporary exclusion order legislation?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the government has done previously, on many occasions, the government should release the Solicitor-General's advice to assure all Australians of this bill's constitutionality. Labor wants a temporary exclusion order scheme that works, that is constitutional, that keeps Australians safe and that can withstand High Court challenges. Yes, there is an imperative to pass this legislation, but not any legislation and not sloppy legislation; it should be legislation that accords with the bipartisan recommendations of the bipartisan Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, a committee that is dominated by Liberal MPs and chaired by a Liberal MP. This Liberal government should take note of those recommendations and should endorse and accept, as it has done previously since 2013, the recommendations of this bipartisan committee. The government should refer the TEO legislation back to the PJCIS to ensure that we have legislation that works. If they do not, they will be jeopardising and politicising national security legislation. If they do not, they will be voting against the recommendations of Senators Abetz, Fawcett and Stoker. They are choosing to play politics with national security legislation and they are breaking the commitment—the compact, if you will—to a bipartisan approach through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government does not refer this back to the PJCIS, Labor will do in the Senate as we are doing in the House right now: moving amendments to give effect to the full recommendations of this bipartisan committee. We have always supported the intent of the temporary exclusion order legislation. Given this lacking response tabled here today by the government, we want to do what the Minister for Home Affairs has failed to do, which is uphold the bipartisan approach to national security legislation and give effect to the recommendations supported by Liberal members on a Liberal dominated committee—unanimous recommendations to improve national security legislation, supported by both Labor and Liberal parties—to ensure that we have a temporary exclusion order scheme that keeps Australians safe, that is constitutional and that works for the benefit of the Australian community.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This annual report into the Surveillance Devices Act 2004, as well as another report tabled today, the annual report into the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979, demonstrate clearly the dangerous path that this country is on. In the last 20 years, we've had over 200 pieces of legislation come through state and territory parliaments and this Commonwealth parliament, all of which erode fundamental rights, freedoms and liberties in this country. These rights and freedoms are amongst those that we used to send Australians overseas to fight—and in some cases, tragically, to die—to defend. We are now giving away these rights and freedoms, hand over fist, as rapidly as possible because the current federal government has done everything it can to scare the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In giving away those fundamental rights and freedoms, we are sleepwalking down the dangerous path to an authoritarian police state in Australia. Make no mistake, that is the ultimate destination of the journey that we are on—becoming a surveillance state, becoming a police state and becoming subject as citizens to invasions of our privacy and, ultimately, to Australia becoming an authoritarian regime. We so desperately need a charter of rights in this country so we can protect and enshrine those fundamental rights and freedoms that actually are amongst those things that make Australia such a great country. Those rights and freedoms that so many of us take for granted are now being taken away, hand over fist, by a combination of the major political parties in this place, the LNP and the ALP. They do that because they stitch up cosy deals behind the closed doors of the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security, a committee that operates often in total secret, without public scrutiny, and which denies any crossbench representation and input into its decision-making process. What we get because of that collusion is the ongoing giving away of fundamental rights and freedoms in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The crossbench should be on the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security; there's no doubt about that. I want to give a couple of examples of issues that have arisen in the last year or so in Australia. The first is  the leaking, which I have no doubt came either from Minister Dutton or from his office, to Simon Benson, a journalist at <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>, of classified ASIO information, a leak which was condemned by Mr Lewis, the head of ASIO, when it happened but which inexplicably the Australian Federal Police have declined to investigate. When you superimpose that onto the recent raids by the Australian Federal Police of prominent media outlets in this country, including News Corp and the ABC, you can understand why there is nervousness starting to emerge amongst our media, amongst journalists, about the intimidatory nature of those raids.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to our media that in fact the issue here is far broader than just press and media freedom; it's about the freedoms of ordinary Australians to go about their day-to-day business without unnecessary spying and intrusion into their personal privacy by intelligence agencies in this country. It's time we had a charter of rights to protect a broad range of rights, including our rights to privacy. It's time that we had an informed conversation in this country about the ongoing erosion of rights and freedoms in the name of national security and an informed debate about whether or not giving away those rights and freedoms is necessary or, indeed, whether giving them away makes us any safer at all from the threats that no doubt exist today. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:16</span>):  I'm continuing my remarks, having spoken on these bills a bit before question time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to further outline the opposition's position: I was saying before that Labor absolutely supports the government's desire to provide additional support for farmers and rural communities who are experiencing drought. All of us want to do that. This is about whether what the government is putting forward is the best way to do so. When I was speaking previously, I was particularly focusing on the fact that, by setting up this Future Drought Fund, the government is raiding an alternative fund which is still very important in rural and regional communities, and that is the Building Australia Fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Building Australia Fund, which was established by the last federal Labor government, is a $3.9 billion fund that this government has failed to draw down on, failed to access and failed to utilise, even though the fund can support projects in drought-affected communities across transport infrastructure, like roads, rail, urban transport and ports; communications infrastructure such as broadband; energy infrastructure; and water infrastructure—all the kinds of things that rural and regional communities are crying out for! Why is it that the government has failed to spend money from the Building Australia Fund, has left it intact, has not drawn on it and is not building any of that infrastructure that is needed, whether it be in rural or regional communities or in urban communities? Now it wants to raid it for an alternative purpose. The reason is that the government fundamentally does not like how the Building Australia Fund is set up and the level of probity that is required to make sure that the money is well spent. Since being elected six years ago, the government has tried on four separate occasions to dismantle the Building Australia Fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've mentioned, the Building Australia Fund was established by Labor in 2008 under the Nation-building Funds Act 2008. Labor established this fund with the explicit purpose of being free of politics. Under the Nation-building Funds Act criteria were developed which must be applied by Infrastructure Australia before projects, other than broadband projects, can be recommended for funding. The fund is built on four key principles. Firstly, projects should address national infrastructure priorities. Secondly, they should demonstrate high benefits and effective use of resources. Thirdly, projects should efficiently address infrastructure needs. Fourthly, they should demonstrate they achieve established standards in their implementation and management. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is these key principles around independent, transparent decision-making that the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison Liberal-National governments so despise. Their problem, when it all boils down to it, is that the Building Australia Fund has four principles around transparency and independent decision-making and making sure that projects are actually needed and will provide value to the country. The Liberals' and Nationals' problem with the Building Australia Fund is that it doesn't have a fifth principle—one that allows for pork-barrelling to win seats in marginal Liberal and National areas of the country. If it had that fifth principle, I reckon we'd get the support of the coalition, because we know that that's the way they have always used these types of infrastructure funds and various other regional funds that they have established. It is this inability to pork-barrel for their mates that those opposite hate so much about the Building Australia Fund. While these bills set up consultation processes for the new Future Drought Fund, the minister can ignore them—just like the health minister so often ignores expert advice with respect to the Medical Research Future Fund. The member for Ballarat made that point yesterday in the House. We've got this series of funds that have been established by the government, theoretically with expert advice processes to help shape the decisions, only to be ignored by ministers within this government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be frank, under the bills as they're being put forward the minister will be able to support his favourite communities, to pork-barrel funding into his preferred seats for the benefit of the National Party at the expense of so many drought-stricken parts of rural and regional Australia. Having visited Darwin twice now since my appointment as shadow minister for northern Australia, and becoming more familiar with the extent of the drought that exists in the Northern Territory, which is really crippling the cattle industry and many other communities across the Northern Territory, I'll be very interested to see how many projects will be funded out of this Future Drought Fund in the electorate of Lingiari, held by Labor, covering a drought-affected area. Let's just wait and see how many projects in that area get funded compared to projects in seats that the National Party have a direct interest in. The seat of Gilmore on the South Coast of New South Wales is another area that's badly affected by drought at the moment. It's held by Labor. Let's wait and see how many projects in the electorate of Gilmore get funding out of this fund, or whether, mysteriously, all the funds flow through to electorates held by the National Party. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have is the government abolishing a fund that was established to provide a strategic, transparent approach to infrastructure investment, led by the independent Infrastructure Australia. This is particularly important at a time when the Reserve Bank is highlighting the need for infrastructure spending to support Australia's flagging economy. Indeed, the very fund the government is abolishing, the Building Australia Fund, could be used in these current economic conditions to help stimulate and support the very communities that are affected by drought. It does not make sense that they are not drawing down on the Building Australia Fund now for projects that have been recommended by Infrastructure Australia to get investment into the economy now in communities across the country. It is pure politics at the expense of rural and regional communities that are doing it so tough right now. These communities need help from the federal government now, not in three months, not in six months, not next year—now. Instead, what they're getting from this government is a fund that will only start distributing funds more than 12 months away. It's not going to give rural and regional communities the support that they need right now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government were to choose to not utilise the Building Australia Fund, there's absolutely no reason that the government can't make an appropriation for drought funding right now. We have been calling for that to happen. There's no reason that the government couldn't decide today to make an appropriation, to make funding available for drought-ridden communities now, not in over 12 months time. I make the point that there's nothing that stopped the government from having made an appropriation at any point over the last six years for drought funding. Of course, they haven't done so. Labor has said time and again we stand ready to support that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe action should be taken now, not in over a year's time, to alleviate the social and economic costs in drought-affected communities and a strategic plan developed for future droughtproofing Australia, including through substantial investment in infrastructure, but these investments must be transparent and made on the best available science and the best available advice to government about what will work in the long term to support our regions. But the hurried introduction of these bills only demonstrates that they have been asleep at the wheel for the past six years—asleep at the wheel on the drought and on water reform, asleep at the wheel on utilising the Building Australia Fund to build infrastructure, leaving regional communities to suffer for far too long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rural and regional Australians need support and action now, not more years spent in consultation. Instead, this government is offering $100 million in about a year's time and another $100 million a year after that, not the $5 billion that they go around using as a headline figure of the fund. In fact this fund won't even reach $5 billion in size for another nine years. It's another furphy that's being put around by this government. It is just $200 million, with not a cent to flow for about a year. It is the removal of the $3.9 billion Building Australia Fund for just $200 million in this term of government for drought funding. As the Leader of the Labor Party said in the House last night, you don't even have to count all the zeros to know that $3.9 billion out and $200 million in is a pretty bad deal. As Labor has repeated time and again, we support greater investment in our rural and regional communities at this time of drought, but the maths are pretty straightforward and the politics are even clearer. The new Future Fund will be a pork-barrel vehicle for the National Party just as we've seen so many other times from the National Party, and it will be to the detriment of communities right across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party will not oppose these bills. We support the additional resources to our rural and regional communities, but, when we return to government, we will restructure Infrastructure Australia and make it a strong body once again. We will ensure that this is a genuinely independent board of experts, making sure that it can do its job in driving microeconomic reform and having proper cost-benefit analysis and rigour in terms of infrastructure. We will establish in the future a fund like the Building Australia Fund because it is essential that there be a funding component to support Infrastructure Australia's rigorous, strategic work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I repeat that there is absolutely no reason that government cannot make an appropriation for drought funding right now. They could have done so at any time during the last six years. Labor has stood ready to support rural and regional communities right across the country, but, for this government, it's all about the politics. You've even seen it in the run-up to the debate today. All the media has been full of government ministers and government backbenchers out there describing this bill as a test of Labor. It's very clear what this government is about. It's all just about politics. It's all about finding wedges for Labor. It almost feels like they haven't realised that they just won the election. They can actually get on and govern in the best interests of the country rather than trying to run around constantly finding wedges with which to test Labor.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:28</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise to support the Future Drought Fund Bill 2019 and Future Drought Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019 despite substantial reservations. Australia's hardworking farmers are suffering desperately in this drought, an entirely natural phenomenon that is part of our country—but that doesn't make it any less difficult for the farmers. Drought support for the land is not just about infrastructure, because there are many on-farm measures that can be taken. This bill places the attention where it needs to be: on the soil. Droughtproofing Australia is in part about regenerating degraded soil to retain more water and, from that, to use less fertiliser and chemicals. The ultimate goal is profitable, stable and sustainable agriculture. Regenerative agriculture, known as regen ag for short, stores water back in the soil. It captures and stores carbon, a natural element that is essential for all life on earth and that is in every living cell of every living organism. I want to compliment the One Nation member for the state seat of Mirani in Queensland for the work he has been doing with farmers, and will continue to do, on this matter. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After pushing for many years, One Nation is now very pleased to see soil regeneration being included in this bill, and we will hold the government accountable to that clearly stated intent. Yet this is not a $5 billion drought bill. The bill provides $100 million each year to be put into a special fund for grants to farmers. But here is the problem: that money does not start to flow until 1 July 2020. In fact, the Future Drought Fund has a full 12 months after 1 July 2020 to put all of the money into that account. This scheme may not be in full swing until mid-2021 and, after processing grant applications, it could be 2022 before farmers can get their hands on their money. So why did Senator Cormann earlier today take to Twitter soon after announcing this bill to declare that the bill would support farmers and drought-affected communities straightaway, when that is not the case? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill provides for fund management expenses to be taken from the special account. Let me say that again: the bill provides for fund management expenses to be taken from the special fund account. Many questions remain around how much will be taken out of that $100 million for expenses in managing the fund. The bill lists page after page of expenses, including the cost of the Future Drought Fund as well as the special fund. One Nation is concerned that this is not a $5 billion bill and it's not a $100 million bill; rather, this bill may well turn out to offer funds in a trickle, not the flood that is needed. In many ways, this seems to be yet another Liberal facade that's going to be sold. One Nation will hold this government accountable to the promises it is making with this bill to provide drought relief. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We go further, though. Why does the government continue to ignore the need for substantial nation building—for future-building and infrastructure projects that could droughtproof much of our nation, particularly our state of Queensland and our neighbouring state of New South Wales? That is a cost-effective and seemingly affordable project that would prevent forever the cost of recurring flood damage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We go further, and ask the government to address Liberal and Labor policies and actions that are crippling Australia's productive capacity. In southern and Central Queensland, farmers are not planting fodder because the electricity prices are absurdly and artificially high. In a drought, farmers are not planting fodder. Electricity prices are high due to unfounded and dishonest energy policies complying with the UN's Paris pseudo agreement and various UN policies and advices. There is a drought, yet farmers are not planting fodder. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After listening to the loony and antihuman Greens, who falsely claim that droughts are due to hydrocarbon fuels, I must address their falsities. They have never, never provided the hard data for their claim and they contradict the empirical scientific evidence that proves hydrocarbon fuels do not and cannot affect climate. The UN initiated this lie, the Greens push it and the Labour-Liberal duopoly drive it in policy, aiming to get Greens preferences. The Greens, I repeat again, have never provided data as proof for their absurd claim. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Banks are also crucifying farmers. That brings them to the edge, and then you get a drought and they go over the edge. Farmers are crippled by banks that have unfettered oligopoly powers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's take another Labor-Liberal policy. How can farmers survive the Howard Liberal government that colluded first in 1996 with the then Borbidge National Party government, and then in 1998 with the Beattie Labor Queensland government and the Carr Labor New South Wales government to steal farmers' properties rights as a way of complying with the UN's Kyoto Protocol? That was repeatedly stated by the then Prime Minister, Mr John Howard, on behalf of his government and echoed and confirmed by Bob Carr and Mr Peter Beattie. I have been calling on the federal government to comply with section 51(xxxi) of the national Constitution and either restore farmers' stolen property rights or compensate them in just terms for the theft—restoration or compensation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to single out Mr Dan McDonald; his lovely wife, Katrina; and their children, James, Ebony and Reece. They are taking on the whole of the Queensland government by standing up for their right to clear their land to provide mulga for their cattle that are starving. They bought that property near Charleville in south-western Queensland particularly because it had mulga and could be cleared, because that then provides natural droughtproofing, and yet he's not allowed to clear the land now. He has lost his property rights as a result of Liberal and Labor governments at federal and state levels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the support from farmers has been slow to come. While wanting faster delivery, we are nonetheless pleased that farmers will be getting support sometime in the next three years. We urge the government to get out and really listen across our wonderful nation and then change its energy and water policies while building vital droughtproofing infrastructure to restore Australia's productive capacity. That is what we in Pauline Hanson's One Nation advocate for: restoring our country's productive capacity.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  I rise to make, for the sake of future speakers, a fairly brief contribution today. I just need to address some of the falsehoods put out there by Senator Watt as to what the government is doing. Senator Watt, and to a degree Senator Roberts, talked as if the Future Drought Fund Bill before us here today is the only thing this government is doing for drought-affected farmers. As my colleague sitting here near me Senator McGrath would know very well, in Queensland and New South Wales this government has put a lot of support towards drought-affected communities in a variety of ways—grants to local governments, farm household allowance, grants for fodder et cetera. The idea that we are waiting for a future date to assist farmers is just an absolute falsehood. It's a nonsense, and it's something that should be condemned in the strongest terms possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this bill does is it sets a path for the future. It sets a path to build the resilience of our farming communities. I grew up on a family farm, a family farm that's been in our family for quite a number of generations now; worked for rural bodies, in particular the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia; and have looked into the eyes of drought-affected farming families—very, very good farmers who have been on the land for generations and who are facing the loss of their property and the loss of their ability to pass that farm on to the next generation thanks to, in this case, the 2006 drought in the eastern Wheatbelt of Western Australia. What this bill will do over time is it will continue to build the resilience of our farming communities. Its initial investment of $3.9 billion grows to $5 billion over the decade. Over time, obviously, this will provide a source of funding to enable on-farm drought-resilience projects to be undertaken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Farmers are resilient. Farmers have got through droughts in Australia for more than 100 years. Even though I saw droughts make it impossible for some farmers to continue, others kept going and they battled their way through the hard times. Families that have been on the land for generations found a way to fight their way through. What this fund will do is provide an opportunity, an option, to continue that process of continually building the resilience of our farming communities, allowing them to proactively adopt new technologies and new opportunities to droughtproof properties and droughtproof agricultural in their particular region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's vitally important that we provide communities with hope for the future. It's certainly not the only thing we are doing in this space, but this is a very important component. It's a vehicle that will be there over the long term. It's a vehicle that will provide to rural and regional Australia over a long period of time a consistent, stable and growing source of funding that will allow regions to undertake significant projects to protect them against future drought events. It will provide farming communities and farming families with a degree of certainty and stability that they perhaps currently don't have. So I do commend the bill. I commend the work that's been done in this space by a number of ministers. This is not all that we are doing to assist drought-affected farmers and drought-affected communities, but it is an important part of that jigsaw.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:41</span>):  I rise to speak on the Future Drought Fund Bill 2019. At the outset, I will just foreshadow that I will be moving my second reading amendment—which is on sheet 5817—to this bill. I want to start by saying that it is kind of insulting, really, to have a bill that sets up a fund to try to help desperately afflicted farmers in drought—and in my state of Queensland almost two-thirds of our entire state is now drought declared, so there are many, many people who are now facing desperate situations—while you continue to ignore the impacts of climate change that are of course driving, worsening and deepening that drought now and will continue to do so in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My colleagues will make a range of contributions—and, indeed, we have a range of amendments that we will be moving to this bill—but our fundamental point is: what is the point if you are not going tackle what is causing the deepness, harshness and cruelty of these droughts? If you continue to have your head in the sand on climate change, you are not faithfully representing or helping those people. Of course, we want to see farmers in drought receive the financial support to try to tackle this, but we also think that they deserve a decent climate policy. This government, sadly, is not going to give them that reality check.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might also bring to mind the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, which was a similar sort of National Party-led slush fund that was meant to have great promise and barely has had any dollars get out the door. It sounds to me as if this fund is going to be pretty similar. It's not starting for ages—it is being rushed through today even though it doesn't kick in for a good 18 months or so—and then it is going to dribble out a little bit of funding each year. Surely you can do a bit better than that. People actually need assistance now. They need a genuine climate policy now, and they shouldn't have the whims of the likes of Minister Littleproud—or perhaps Barnaby Joyce will be minister again by then—dictating what little pet project gets funding. That's why I'm pleased that there have been some amendments that establish some level of accountability, transparency and oversight—though not quite enough, in our view. My colleague Senator Rice has run through the amendments that we will move to try to further tighten that process. This parliament shouldn't set up another slush fund for the National Party to administer while that party continues to abrogate its duty to tackle climate change and genuinely represent its members. That's the first point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also concerned, as I believe my colleagues on the Labor benches are concerned, that this money would strip needed funds from an infrastructure fund. Yes, the government haven't spent anything from that infrastructure fund in recent years, but it was set up for good reason and has meritorious projects that could have funding allocated. But of course the government just want to score yet another political point and have decided to grab that money and try to spend it elsewhere. If they were genuine about wanting to alleviate the drought, not only would they have a better climate policy but they would decide that this was worthy of some funds that were not stolen from some other decent project but instead came from consolidated revenue or, as my colleague has proposed, from a levy on the fossil fuel resources industries. As you've probably heard us say before in this place, we know that coal and coal seam gas are driving climate change, which is furthering, worsening and deepening the drought, and yet all of our policies under this government are yet more subsidies for the mining industry, yet more free rides. The mining industry don't pay the appropriate amount of corporate taxes and they get many thousands of public subsidies for the privilege of taking out what are meant to be publicly owned resources. This is why we want to make it crystal clear that none of the investments made by the Future Drought Fund should further fossil fuels, and nor should the money come at the expense of an infrastructure fund when it could come from the fossil fuel industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me to the substance of the second reading amendment that I will be moving, which is:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It makes a bit of a mockery of this plan for a drought fund and alleviation of drought through financial contributions when you've got state and territory governments giving free water to big mining companies and to coal seam gas companies. I want to go into a bit more detail about that. There's a little project that you might have heard mentioned sometimes—certainly it exercises the mind of Senator Canavan, who earlier told the chamber he'd been trying to get this mine up for years. It is of course the Adani mine. They're on a pretty good wicket when it comes to their water entitlements. In fact, the farmers in the region that they share are pretty cross about it. For the record, Adani have an associated water licence granted to them by the Queensland state Labor government which is for 60 years. It's got no volumetric cap, so they can take an unlimited amount of groundwater.</span>

It is 9½ billion litres of groundwater, which is almost as much as all of the other local users—most of them agricultural and farming—combined. They don't have to pay. It's free. It's unlimited. That is precisely why we are in the predicament that we are in. You cannot say that giving free water to a big coalmining multinational company, while the region is drought declared—and the minister wasn't here; I remind him that 65 per cent of our state is drought declared—is a good decision. That is exactly why we are moving an amendment to point out that the decisions to give a free ride to the fossil fuel industry—not just on their taxes, on subsidies for cheap diesel and on accelerated depreciation but on free, unlimited water, which nobody else gets—fundamentally undermine the utility of this so-called Future Drought Fund. I hope that, on that basis, we will receive support for our second reading amendment when I move it. And I'm sure the minister also knows this, although it predates his time in parliament: in 2011 an irrigator had their licence application rejected in the very same region where Adani have now had a 60-year unlimited groundwater entitlement given to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to move on to the surface water that Adani has also gotten a very nice, cushy deal on from our state Labor government. They've got a surface water licence of 12½ billion litres per year to extract water from the Suttor River. That licence was actually granted without public consultation, because again our state government gave Adani a free ride. Even though it was tightening up the water laws for everyone else at the time, it made an exception for Adani. So 12½ billion litres of surface water from the Suttor River—again, that region is suffering from crippling drought. How can you stand here and say that you are trying to tackle the drought when you have no climate policy, when you're giving subsidies to fossil fuel companies and when other government regimes—I acknowledge this is the state government—are giving free water to those same fossil fuel companies that are not only depriving the farmers of that water but also, when their product is burnt, exacerbating the conditions that will worsen the drought, not to mention all of the other climate impacts? These are impacts that not only our land managers but not all of us have to face. The sheer hypocrisy of this situation is really getting a bit boring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that we found quite concerning was the approach that was taken with this bill. I accept that an earlier version of this bill was tabled—when was it?—in November last year, but it has been significantly changed since then. Of course, it has been expunged from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>and reintroduced—we're in a new parliament; we've had an election since it was introduced—and yet this bill in its current form, with those changes that have been made, was only introduced to the House yesterday morning. It was rammed through the House yesterday—I understand Labor were a bit cross about that yesterday, but apparently they've changed their position on that today—and it's been brought to us today. And here we are now; we're talking about it. It has been just over 24 hours, and yet this government expects this bill to be passed without proper scrutiny. I'm sure they won't even consider any of the amendments that we'll be moving, even though our amendments go to actually tackling climate change, which could help us to reduce the severity and devastation of future droughts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It just feels to me like this government is trying to be very performative—it's desperately trying to wedge the opposition—and it seems to have forgotten that it's actually here to govern the country. Now, we have very different views about how it should be doing that, and that's fine, but you've actually got a job to do. It would be useful if you started to pay attention to that, rather than just scoring political points off your opponents: making them squirm, ramming stuff through and making them backflip. They're always going to backflip; we see that time and time again. We kind of expect that now. We get that. It's very damaging when you treat this institution with such little regard. The cut-off order exists for a purpose. The rule that you can't ram a bill through in a sitting chunk exists for a purpose, and yet you've just thrown it out of the window. This bill was rammed through the House yesterday, and now you want to ram it through the Senate. We think that's not good process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've put up amendments that we think would strengthen this bill. They go to having a proper climate policy.  They go to not giving a free ride to those water-guzzling fossil fuel companies. They go to the greater transparency measures that my colleague outlined, which would actually give this chamber more oversight over the particular projects that were to be funded from this fund, but we don't have a terribly good track record of getting support for our sensible, measured, well-thought-through amendments. I don't expect we'll get a lot of support for them this time around either, so there is all the more reason to have a proper process for this bill, so it could be scrutinised, so the opposition party could at least have a proper chance to send it through their caucus. They were rightfully concerned yesterday that they didn't have a chance to do that. I'm not quite sure why they've changed their mind and why they didn't object to exempting this bill from the cut-off order this morning and ramming it through. I think there was an abrogation of process there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But here we are. We have a bill that will hopefully provide some support to farmers, but it won't start flowing for 18 months, it won't tackle climate change and it won't tackle the deep unfairness of mining companies getting free water while farmers in that very same region are struggling. Farmers are having to tighten their belts and are wondering where their water is going to come from while Adani gets a 60-year groundwater licence and a 12½-billion-litre licence for surface water. Seriously, what more can we give to this company? What on earth are you saying to those farmers when they are desperate for an explanation as to why they are not getting the water? I don't know what it is that you're saying, because I know that Bruce Currie, one of the farmers, was very distressed about the inequity, as quoted in an article that I have just here:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't see legislation here to address the threats to the Great Artesian Basin or the drawdown from the overallocation of free water to mining companies. I remember one of your former colleagues, who has left us now—in fact in the first inquiry I was involved in when I started in this chamber in 2011—called for protection for the Great Artesian Basin.</span>

                    </a>  I'm not too sure that you should be proud to be opposing protection for the Great Artesian Basin, because that is what that Senate committee inquiry recommended. We have seen zero action on that. It has been eight years and there has been nothing to protect the Great Artesian Basin. I do think that these farmers and land managers are a bit cluier than you give them credit for. They are pretty cross that their entitlements are getting restricted when mining companies have free rein.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By all means rush the bill through—we thought it should follow the proper processes but it seems that no-one actually minds so much about what the proper processes are anymore—but please consider supporting these very sensible amendments which would make sure this parliament can have proper scrutiny over not just the broad plans but the actual projects for which funding is sought. That builds on the amendments of the former member for Indi, Cathy McGowan, in her time in the other place. This amendment notes that you are just going to undermine any sort of genuine drought response by continuing to turn a blind eye to the free ride that the big fossil fuel companies are getting when it comes to water.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought the National Party were meant to represent farmers. They keep taking a whole lot of donations from fossil fuel companies in recent years and they're nowhere on this issue. People deserve representation. Everyone, no matter what political background they come from, deserves to feel like they have a voice in this place. I'm very saddened because the bush are feeling abandoned. I hope that the National Party do some soul-searching and try to remember whom they initially said they were going to represent, because the farmers that I meet with are deeply concerned about climate change. They can see the impacts of it not just on their water supply but on the fragility of their land and the severity of the bushfires.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Canavan knows this—his own backyard was affected—yet we still have no decent climate policy. I don't know how often members of the government meet with climate scientists—and I don't expect that particular members of the crossbench who don't accept the climate science have any meetings—but I urge the government to genuinely consult with the expert climate scientists and get a real handle on what we can expect is going to be wreaked on our lands, our precious environment and our communities if you continue to do very little, an inadequate amount, on climate change and if you continue to subsidise hand over fist the very industries that are fuelling this problem and are worsening and deepening the droughts. You've backed the wrong horse. You really have. It is not fair that we have billions of dollars in subsidies going to coalmining and coal seam gas companies when farmers are struggling, when species are being sent to the wall with the extinction crisis that is already underway, when half of the reef has been bleached.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are not just social and environmental impacts; these are also economic impacts. I would have thought that the government, though they clearly don't care much for the social or environmental impacts, might be moved by the economic impacts. So, please, I urge you to do some genuine consultation with climate scientists, in particular those who know about the impact on water. Sadly, in that 60-year unlimited groundwater licence that Adani was handed by the Queensland state Labor government, the modelling did not take into account the climate impacts on groundwater and water generally. It was not required to because, evidently, our laws are so incredibly weak. That is a gross oversight. We don't lack scientific advisers, but it seems the government and our state government lack the will to actually listen to them. I urge support for the second reading amendment, and I formally move that at this point.</span>

Those of us who are actually from regional Australia do talk about the millennium drought and the droughts of 1900, 1930 and the 1960s. This is not the first drought that we've been through, and drought doesn't just affect people in the regions. It not only dries up creeks, rivers, crops and paddocks; it dries up hope. Regional and rural towns suffer. The shops struggle and people move away, leaving local councils battling to pay for essential services. In the cities, food and fibre don't make it to the processing plants and the shops, which costs jobs. Thankfully, good times do return. Drought doesn't just affect specific regions; it affects us all, which is why this Morrison government is rolling up its sleeves and doing what needs to be done to improve drought resilience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Future Drought Fund is designed to draw down $100 million a year, in good times and bad times, to invest in important resilience projects that will keep food not only on farmers' tables but on everyone's tables and will keep money pumping through small rural communities and regional cities. Establishing this fund is more proof that the Liberal Nationals are the only people looking out for regional and rural Australia. The money will be used to support investment in research and innovation, research extension, the adoption of new technology, improved environmental and natural resource management, infrastructure and community initiatives. These objectives are all crucial to bolstering the future of our regions. This kind of resilience must also be supported by the state and local governments and by private enterprise. I implore them to support what we're trying to do with this fund, because helping regional and rural communities better withstand tough times benefits us all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give assurance to those on the other side that this program is important. It's important because it gives certainty. It gives certainty to people who are most affected by drought to start planning projects, to improve water efficiency and to be more resilient for when the good times return. It is important for them to know that there is ongoing funding and that this is not just one round that will disappear if they've missed out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that's important is that, if we pass this bill tonight, government must be seen to move quickly and provide certainty to people. Previous speakers have spoken about what bush people want and about them feeling abandoned. They're not feeling abandoned by this government; they're feeling abandoned by naysayers and people who think they shouldn't be out growing food and fibre on our land. This program will tackle the climate change issues that have been raised by previous speakers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Queensland we know how to manage mining. We have very strong regulations and we've been doing it for nearly 200 years. In my experience working in the Queensland government a few years ago, there were some great advances, particularly around the globe, which provided great scientific measurement and transparency of water table measurements. It is now a requirement—and this was introduced under Andrew Cripps, when he was the Minister for Natural Resources and Mines—for mining companies to provide watertable measurements from bores around their property. So it is just not true that people are taking unlimited water with no consequence. There is great transparency in water measurement in Queensland. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Great Artesian Basin is an important asset and is one that, as graziers and farmers, we all rely upon. But, again, this program will allow us to introduce more measures to have transparency and good water use. The delay in passing this legislation has already cost $76 million, and I think that there is not a moment to be lost. I would close by urging us to pass this as soon as we possibly can.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WHISH-WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:08</span>):  I rise to speak on the Future Drought Fund Bill 2019. I want to start with the very simple point that we know, from all available science, that drought, the increased incidence of drought and the increased severity of droughts are linked to our changing climate. I totally understand that Australia has long been known as the sunburnt country. Droughts are part of our history. This country, clearly, is amenable to drought and all the consequences that go with it. We know the hardship that droughts cause and are increasingly likely to cause into the future, especially when we see record weather events and record droughts such as we have now in parts of our country, and droughts such as the millennium drought that we saw nearly a decade ago and, prior to that, the record drought in this country in 1982 and 1983. We see the hardship it causes local communities and the government funds that are required to help bail out hardworking, struggling farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very shortly going to go through in a bit more detail some of the sad direct effects of droughts. It kind of beggars belief that we, a country so familiar with drought and its consequences, wouldn't be talking at this time in history about the link of drought to climate change and taking the strongest possible action on climate change. I don't think I've heard the words 'climate change' or 'climate catastrophe' or whatever you want to call it mentioned once in relation to this bill by those on the other side of the chamber, yet surely it's the most important thing we should be discussing. There are scientifically established links between our record drought now, which no-one is denying is linked to climate, and the expected severity of extreme weather events in the future, which include drought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's fine to be taking taxpayers' money and giving it to this Liberal-National government to dole out where it sees it needs to be spent on regional communities—adaption measures have their place—but where is the imperative for mitigation of the underlying cause of these record droughts and all the misery that they bring our regional and rural areas? Where is the imperative for those mitigation measures? As we've seen with the Great Barrier Reef, a so-called record investment of half a billion dollars given to a private foundation to help manage avoiding a World Heritage in danger listing for the world's largest living organism, we are just throwing good money after bad if we don't actually do everything we can to address and fix the underlying problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to raise in my speech today—and I will be foreshadowing a second reading amendment—how we fund any drought assistance packages. The Labor Party have given their speeches and talked about their concerns about the funds coming from infrastructure funding that had been allocated for projects. Not only am I concerned about that; I'd even be concerned if the funding for this drought relief package through this bill were coming from general revenue. I've got a suggestion that I'd like senators to consider—and the Greens will be putting up an amendment around this. Why don't we take funds from the companies and the activities of those companies that are actually causing rising emissions, which we know are directly linked to the changes we're seeing in our climate, and actually have them pay for struggling farmers to help adapt to a future of drought?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have clocked up in this country, in just one tax regime alone—the petroleum resource rent tax, which I have continually called in this place the petroleum rort rent tax—nearly $360 billion in tax credits for some of the biggest, wealthiest corporations on the planet, who have paid no petroleum resource rent tax. We have had a Senate inquiry into this. Everybody agreed it needed to be changed. We've seen some tweaks around the edges. But, if we put a 10 per cent floor in the petroleum resource rent tax—which funnily enough actually benefits those companies in the long term; it's actually less money they have to pay if they ever do pay a cent—then we can actually raise $2½ billion each year or $5 billion over the next two years to pay for this fund directly from the companies that are causing the problem in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not even proposing, as Senator Cormann might like to use the turn of phrase, 'a new tax'. It's an existing tax that doesn't work that needs to be fixed. If we're going to find money to give to rural and regional communities that desperately need funds to help them adapt to a sad future and a dangerous future of increased severity of drought and extreme weather, let's take it from the companies that are actually causing this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, I would very much like to propose that we do that through a carbon pricing mechanism, which is being called for by not just the Greens. We had one in this country, but it got ripped up. It's actually the business community—the big end of the business community—that's calling for carbon pricing. Even companies like BHP, the big mining companies that are part of the brigade of big polluters on this planet, are calling for carbon pricing. They're calling for the certainty of a mechanism that prices their pollution. They acknowledge it's pollution. A carbon price could raise tens of billions of dollars and pay for the damage that's been done to our economy and our communities by climate change, not just drought. Instead, we're taking money from an infrastructure fund or we're taking it from general revenue rather than hypothecating it directly from sources that we know would link the causes of the problems we're seeing in rural and regional communities. Call it a polluter-pays principle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from the science that climate change is making drought conditions in south-west and south-east Australia worse. I'm very proud to say that a lot of the scientists who do this work are in my home state of Tasmania. They're a very important part of the community, especially in Hobart. Greens senator Senator Rice and I and a number of other senators, including Senator Carr, chaired a select committee to stop cuts to CSIRO climate scientists. The jobs of 300 of them were on the line, and they're the ones who do the modelling and the observations—all the measurements that we need if we are to better understand how to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Nevertheless, their great work tells us that fronts from the Southern Ocean, which typically in the past have brought rain across southern Australia during winter and spring, have shifted southwards with the warming climate, leading to declines in rainfall in south-west and south-east Australia. That increases directly the risk of drought in these regions, even in my home state of Tasmania. Believe it or not, I was working on my vineyard the year that the north-east of Tasmania was officially drought declared.</span>

                    </a>  It shocked a lot of people that a place in Tasmania was eligible for drought funding. It hasn't got any better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the mid-1990s, south-east Australia has experienced a 15 per cent decline in the late-autumn and early-winter rainfall and a 25 per cent decline in average rainfall in both April and May. The average annual streamflow into Perth's dams, in your home state of Western Australia—sorry, I missed your interjection, Senator Smith—has already decreased by nearly 80 per cent since the mid-1970s. Climate change is driving and increasing the intensity and frequency of hot days and heatwaves in Australia, and this in turn is increasing the severity of droughts. Once again, the sad reality in my home state of Tasmania is that it is getting drier. We have seen wildfires in three out of the last five years in wilderness areas, some of which haven't seen fire for thousands of years. We know that because we know that the species of plants there aren't fire resistant. They won't come back if they're burnt; they're there because they have not seen fire. These areas are being ignited by dry lightning, which itself is very rare, but the root cause of it is the very, very dry state of Tasmania. The impact of these fires is not just felt by the environment community, the ecosystems and the biodiversity of these places; it is very much felt by communities around Tasmania who have to volunteer, with the disruption that causes to the volunteers who have to go and fight these fires. No-one has estimated the economic damage it did this summer, but I can tell you it would have been significant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People come to Tasmania. We heard a speech today which did have some positive things in it. It talked about tourism in Tasmania and why it's a very important industry, but if every summer we're going to experience these kinds of wildfires it won't be high on the visitation list for much longer. A lot of businesses this year had bookings cancelled. We had entire areas, which were some of the most visited parts of the state, shut because of these wildfires. The smoke in Tasmania went on for weeks and weeks in key areas. This is a very serious matter. While it may not officially be drought, it has the same weather patterns and the same changes.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  I rise to make a brief contribution tonight. This is the first opportunity I've had since our quite remarkable election victory to pay tribute to some of the unsung, hard workers of the campaign. In particular, I had the privilege of working with a candidate in an—unfortunately—safe Labor seat, the seat of Fremantle, Nicole Robins, a wonderful young candidate who put her energy, her drive and her enthusiasm for young people into a wonderful campaign. Nicole is a truly remarkable person. She is only 30 years of age, but she's already been in local government for over a decade. She has an extraordinary amount to offer our side of politics, and I certainly hope and trust that Nicole will have a very bright future in our party. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to pay tribute to those hardworking members of Nicole's campaign committee: her husband, Brendan; the president, Paul Connolly; Michelle Hoffman; Derrick Ruane; Josh Olsen; and Joanne and Garry Foxton, Nicole's mum and dad. And I also want to thank Michael Hayden, Maddie White and Kate Price for their sterling hard work. Theirs was an unwinnable campaign but we fought the good fight and contributed to the Western Australian Liberal Party being able to send three senators to this place—with the addition of Matt O'Sullivan, which is a wonderful addition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to add to that list Jo Stanton, the Fremantle women's president, who also made a remarkable contribution day after day on prepoll booths. These are the unsung heroes of our election victory—people who put themselves out and volunteered their time. They did so because they believe in the values of our great Liberal Party, because they believe in what we stand for and because they believe in delivering good government to this country and to my home state of Western Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I want to pay tribute to our state director, Sam Calabrese, who did an outstanding job across the state, managing a number of hard-fought marginal seat campaigns where the kitchen sink was thrown at our sitting members and at new candidates in previously Liberal seats. The whole team at head office did an absolutely remarkable job. It was a very well-oiled machine—very professional, very dedicated and hardworking. Again, these are the unsung heroes of the election campaign, and I just wanted to pay tribute to them tonight. Thank you. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CICCONE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:23</span>):  This is not my first speech. I rise tonight to pay tribute to a former colleague and friend, Wilhelm Bernard Darrel Schumacher, who sadly passed away in the early hours of Wednesday, 3 July, just a few weeks ago. I wish to put on the record my gratitude for his friendship and support. Darrel was a caring, compassionate and giving person. He was also someone who was respected and acknowledged by all who knew him. For 18 years Darrel was a dedicated staff member of the Victorian branch of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, where we worked together for many years. He was a warm and friendly presence in the office and I know all his colleagues and friends, like myself, are deeply saddened and shocked by his passing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Darrel, as a dedicated unionist, understood that, when workers use their collective voice to bargain with employers, they have more power and can win far better pay and conditions and that, without that collective voice, workers suffer. At the SDA Darrel supported and advocated for retail workers, for warehouse employees and for staff in fast-food chains. During his time at the union, Darrel helped many members to fight for better pay and conditions. He advocated for them in workplace disputes and stood up for them when they needed support in their workplace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the union was just one part of his life. What was always very clear to us at the union was that Darrel was a proud husband, father and grandfather as well as a passionate Sydney Swans supporter. This was shown again at his funeral earlier this month where Darrel's son, Hans, spoke about his father very warmly and shared his dedication to his wife, Sandy, and his children and grandchildren. In the days before his death, Darrel dictated a note to be shared with family and friends at the SDA. He said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… the time has come to say goodbye and I want to be able to thank you all for all the pleasant and happy times that we have achieved along the way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You guys have been really lovely to me personally and to my family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I want you to treasure the great times so that what we are left with are fantastic memories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">May God bless each and every one of you for contributing to these memories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Darrel's final thoughts were for his friends and family, that they remember the happy times—a testament to his kindness and generosity. For him, being a unionist was a calling—to help people in need and promote equity and fairness in the workplace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We celebrate a great man who made an impact on our lives and the lives of many workers. I'll always remember many of his stories and I'll always hold a special place in my heart for these memories. I send my deepest sympathies to Sandy, Hans, Rochelle, Natasha, Elise, Tayla, Ethan, Jaxon and Harvey. Darrel, may you rest in eternal peace, mate. You'll be greatly missed and you are definitely in my prayers.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:27</span>):  More than one million Uygurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities are detained in Xinjiang by the Chinese government in what the UN calls re-education camps. This mass detention of Uygurs against their will in internment camps is a total abuse of human rights. This systemic oppression includes the erosion of ethnic identity of the Uygur people and imposition of religious restrictions in a region that has transformed into a surveillance state. The world knows what's happening but there has been a deathly lack of meaningful action on this issue from the highest levels of government in Australia and around the world. I do welcome the letter signed by Australia and 21 other nations at the Human Rights Council recently which urged China to end its mass arbitrary detentions and related violations and called on China to allow UN and international observers to access the region, but this is not enough. Torn apart from their families, imprisoned for years and suffering in the dark shadows of secrecy, these people have nowhere to turn. The United Nations has called these camps a 'no rights zone', and the world isn't batting an eyelid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent groundbreaking investigation by the ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program, led by the excellent Sophie McNeill, told the heartbreaking stories of the Australian Uygur community whose families have been separated and who have partners, brothers, sisters, children and parents being held in forced detention in Xinjiang. Sadam's wife and two-year-old son, who is an Australian citizen, are trapped in Xinjiang. He is at his wit's end. He's desperate to be reunited with them. It is gut-wrenching to see a young man lose hope, but he hasn't given up just yet. His strength and courage in coming out publicly to somehow get his family here not only is admirable but also has shone a light on the horrific human rights abuses in Xinjiang.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Almas, another young Uygur, last saw his wife on Valentine's Day in 2017 when he visited China to surprise her. The month after he visited she was taken away by Chinese police when she was on her way to hospital to confirm a home pregnancy test. This was over two years ago. She hasn't been seen or heard from since and no-one knows what's happened to her pregnancy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These stories break my heart. There are so many more that we haven't heard, that we haven't seen and that we'll probably never know about. Just last week, I stood outside foreign minister Marise Payne's office with Sadam and Almas asking her to take action to reunite these families. I do urge the minister and the Australian government to leave no stone unturned to bring families back together. Both Sadam and Almas are here tomorrow in parliament, and I do hope that you can find it in your hearts to go and meet them and have a chat to them and hear them out. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Four</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Corners</span> program also unveiled evidence of forced labour from these re-education camps in China. The investigators named retailers Target, Cotton On, Jeanswest, IKEA, Dangerfield, and H&amp;M as sourcing cotton for their products from this area. Not knowing if their supply chain is involved in human slavery isn't good enough. Reports of links between Australian universities and the development of Chinese government technology used in oppression and human rights violations of Uygurs are also extremely disturbing. Suggestions that Australian research may have contributed to racially profiling Uygurs is equally disturbing. Universities must urgently review their existing partnerships and their research ethics processes to ensure that their work does not contribute to global oppression and abuses of human rights. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Analysis of satellite imagery has shown that in the last year alone the camps have expanded at an exponential rate. The Uygurs and other Muslims in China have suffered economic marginalisation, cultural genocide and political oppression for decades. A pervasive, technologically advanced surveillance apparatus is in place in all of Xinjiang. The United Nations human rights chief is still awaiting clearance from the Chinese government after having repeatedly asked China to grant the UN access to Xinjiang. The Australian government must become much bolder in defending the rights of China's minorities. The horrific human rights abuses against China's Turkic Muslims and the minorities can no longer be ignored. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="283601" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator VAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:32</span>):  I note that, while this is the first time I rise to speak in the chamber, this is not my official first speech. I want to thank the Senate for allowing me to speak on a tragic event in advance of my first speech. I rise to raise awareness of an issue of significance in light of a recent tragedy, and I thank the Senate for indulgence to speak on this important matter. On Saturday 6 July a Victorian constituent of mine and long-time Liberal party member, Mr Anton Hermann, was fatally injured in a cycling collision while on a family holiday in Port Douglas in Queensland. At a time of what should have been an active and fun cycling adventure during a school holiday trip with his wife and children, a most devastating and unnecessary tragedy occurred with the death of Mr Hermann. Anton, as he was known, was a well-loved, respected member of the Victorian Jewish community and a professional in Victoria's legal fraternity. I rise not only to convey my deepest sympathies to the family of Mr Hermann, especially his wife, Karen, and his three children, Joel, Ella and Tahlia, but also to highlight the ever-growing scourge of cycling related incidents between riders and cars. I give Mr Hermann's family the assurance that his legacy will not be in vain and I will continue to advocate for better protection for cyclists on the road, particularly those in my home state of Victoria. As more and more people look to alternative means of transport, including cycling, it also means that drivers must be hypervigilant in ensuring that they drive with cyclists' safety in mind. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, however, Mr Hermann's story is not an unusual one. The statistics on cyclist related deaths are astoundingly high, despite the fact that cycling safety has been an ever-growing issue for advocacy and concern for legislators. Sadly, since 2015, 165 cyclists have died in Australia, including 48 in Victoria—a disproportionally high number in my home state. For those who are fortunate enough to survive cycling related incidents, there have been almost 33,000 accidents resulting in the hospitalisation of cyclists, between the years of 2013 and 2017. This means that, on average, one cyclist in Australia is hospitalised every 80 minutes. Obviously, this doesn't take into account the numerous collisions that don't result in hospitalisation. We can and must do better. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This issue is also personally close to my heart. I've been a cyclist throughout my life, influenced by my father, who was a former professional competitive cyclist. I too raced on the road and on the track. So I'll continue to raise this crucial issue in this chamber so we can aim towards achieving a zero death toll. During my many years as a cyclist, I too have been involved in several cycling accidents and near misses. They have instilled grave concern in me. What is important to note in this debate is that these are accidents, after all. I have been hit by a car twice. Luckily, both resulted only in barking my shins and a broken bike. The drivers offered profuse apologies and simply reasoned that they must not have been paying attention, because they hadn't seen me. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These unfortunate events are accidents. Even when the results are devastating, like with Mr Hermann, we must remember that these drivers did not intend to hurt or harm the cyclist. An accident can happen due to a mere loss of concentration, a distraction or simply a lack of education about cyclist safety. This is not to make excuses but to ensure that we approach this issue from the perspective that we can do better, rather than a guilt-and-shame approach. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cycling safety can be improved through a multipronged approach—through legislation, education and awareness campaigns intended to encourage drivers to modify their behaviour on the roads. The legislative position of laws related to cyclist safety are known mostly as 'safe passing' laws. These laws generally mandate that, in most jurisdictions, motorists must leave a gap of at least one metre when passing a cyclist on the road. That gap is sometimes increased to 1.5 metres in areas of higher speed limits. These laws don't exist in my home state of Victoria, and I'd like to use this occasion to call on the Andrews government to pass them immediately.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="112096" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy President and Chair of Committees</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:37</span>):  A couple of weeks ago, in early July, I had the privilege of spending a week with the Army Aboriginal Community Assistance Program in Jigalong, in my home state of Western Australia. This experience is offered as part of the ADF Parliamentary Program, and I'd urge all senators, particularly new senators, to do one of the program experiences. They are definitely worth doing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to send out a big thankyou to the Martu people, who are the traditional owners of the Jigalong area, the Western Desert and further out. They warmly welcomed me to their community, and I sincerely thank them for showing me around the Jigalong community. I'd also like to thank Major Daniel Palmer for hosting me and Julie Owens, the member for Parramatta, and for the warm welcome that we received at Camp Birt. In particular, I'd like to thank our 'girl gang', Lieutenants Toya and Taya. The 6th Engineer Support Regiment is a mighty fine regiment, and their can-do attitude was evident in everything they undertook.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are four lines of engagement at Jigalong: training, community engagement, health and construction. Certainly, in terms of community engagement, during NAIDOC Week there were a lot of activities for children at Jigalong. There are regular football games, which the kids absolutely love. They appear on their red-dirt oval on Tuesdays at 5 pm and they really like playing footy with the guys and girls from the 6th Engineer Support Regiment—and those ADF personnel certainly enjoy playing footy with the kids. It's mutual in that respect. There are weekly meetings with elders. There is a great hospitality and construction program underway as well as a health program that has been supporting the local Aboriginal health clinic at Jigalong, adding in a dental program. There is also a vet up there to take care of the dogs. You can see all of the dogs that have visited the vet; they're all sporting new collars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd particularly like to mention two amazing Martu artists, Helen Samson and Dadda Samson. They are two of the Martu women undertaking hospitality training. What they'd like to set up is a tourism venture out to the rabbit-proof fence. I think the rabbit-proof fence is part of most Western Australians' psyches; it's probably even broader than that. To go out there with those Martu women and see that fence was amazing. Of course, they pointed out a lot of particular history and plants along the way. On the way back from the rabbit-proof fence, we set up camp in a very broad riverbed where Dadda cooked this amazing damper. The next day, Julie, when she went out on a similar program, had roo-tail stew with her damper. It was fantastic. We had billy tea and damper over the fire, and exchanged stories and experiences. The women also took us to the old Jigalong community and talked about where they grew up and so on. I really hope that that tourism venture that the Army is supporting the local Martu people on gets off the ground. Jigalong is not that far out from Newman, and I think it would be an attraction for a lot of people who holiday in that region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to thank Alice. Julie and I were very brave; we undertook three PT sessions with the ADF. Alice the trainer—and a superb barista operator, I have to say—kept us pretty fit with PT programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We couldn't have been made to feel more welcome by the Martu people and the regiment. It was a terrific week, and we were sad to go. I wish them well. They've got a couple of major events coming up, and then that program will conclude in August. I wish the Martu community well in the partnership that they have created with the ADF.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="76760" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GRIFF</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:42</span>):  I rise to speak on the Industry Specialist Mentoring for Australian Apprentices program, or ISMAA for short, a $60 million national program I negotiated with the government almost two years ago. ISMAA has had a very positive impact across all trades, particularly in the automotive industry nationally and in my home state of South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since Australia's passenger vehicle manufacturing ceased in 2017, there's been a perception that the automotive industry has hit the skids. It drives me mad because it just isn't so. The auto industry is not dead; it's very much alive and kicking. As a matter of fact, in Australia there are an estimated 35,000 jobs up for grabs due to automotive skills shortages right across the country—not just in vehicle manufacturing but also in new and used car and truck yards, car detailers, repair shops and tyre and spare parts outlets—and the number of jobs is very much on the rise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems incredible that, at the same time we have stubbornly high youth unemployment, this industry is struggling to fill jobs. What can we do about it? For a start, we can help apprentices complete their apprenticeships. Far too many, for various reasons, drop out before achieving their qualification. Back in 2017 I recognised the need for greater mentoring support for motor trade apprentices who were at risk of pulling out of their training as early as the first year. The Motor Trade Association of South Australia briefed me on a previous mentoring program that had boosted apprenticeship retention rates from a low 50 per cent to around 90 per cent. I was astounded that one program could help so much. What I found even more astounding was that the then Abbott government had pulled the plug on a mentoring program in its infamous 2014-15 budget for no other reason than to help balance the books. Apprenticeship retention rates predictably fell after that program was pulled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fast forward a year, and I succeeded in securing $60 million to establish the new ISMAA program to support apprentices and trainees through their first two years of training. So far, ISMAA has assisted a staggering 30,000 apprentices from thousands of employers across a broad range of industries including construction, mining, retail trade, accommodation and food services, utility services and, of course, automotive. Completion rates aren't yet available for all industries but, if they are anything like those reported by the automotive industry, retention and course completion is likely to be around 90 per cent, thanks to the fantastic pastoral care and career support offered by mentors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently saw a couple of employer testimonials that were shared online by the Australian Cabinet and Furniture Association. One employer who had five apprentices in the ISMAA program wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I have observed all of the individuals involved grow in confidence and improve their communication skills. Discussions with their mentor has allowed the apprentice to open dialogues with the company regarding their future and the skills they would like to learn going forward. This has resulted in opportunities that may not have eventuated without the mentoring support provided.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It makes economic sense that government commits ongoing funds to this type of program because it has an immediate payback to industry and ensures more school leavers gain qualifications whilst being employed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mentoring programs are there to help apprentices jump any life hurdles they are facing that might prevent them from succeeding in their training. They may need help for serious issues such as anxiety or depression or a reliance on drugs or alcohol, or be coping with the challenges of youth adulthood such as moving out of home or even organising themselves so they get to work on time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was informed by Senator Canavan today, who was responding to a question I asked of Senator Cash in question time, that the government was proud of the performance of the ISMAA program; I am too. He also said that government intends that apprenticeship support network contracts will in future require providers to facilitate mentoring as part of their in-training supports. I will be watching this space closely to ensure that this activity is tangible and not tokenistic, that apprentices get the mentoring support they need when they need it and that it is appropriately funded. Before I close, I must congratulate Paul Unerkov and the South Australian Motor Trades Association team on their implementation of the mentoring program and for achieving a champion 95 per cent retention rate. Well done.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:47</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I wish to discuss the burden, the suffering and the courage of a group under assault across our country or, as former State of Origin rugby league star player Marty Bella now realises and calls it, an ideological assault on rural Australia. Senator Pauline Hanson first started discussing this in 1996, one of the first things she did when she got into the lower house. Maurice Newman, well-known businessman and former banker, has spoken about this issue many times publicly in recent years. Rick Gurnett, a farmer, who is a strong supporter and also a member of Katter's Australia Party, has known about this for 20 years. Paul Keating's government signed the deal with the United Nations in 1992.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Marty Bella is a co-founder of Green Shirts, the real conservationists and protectors of the environment and he finds himself now in a real battle. State of Origin was one thing, but Marty, who is a councillor in the Mackay area, is now in a real battle trying to protect many farmers and many other coastal residents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to talk about the McDonald family, who I have enormous respect and regard for. Dan, his wife, Katrina, who still barracks for the All Blacks—but, nonetheless, she is a wonderful person—their son, James, who is about 21, 22, their daughter, Ebony, and their second son, Reece, bought a property at Charleville in south-west Queensland particularly because it had stands of mulga which they can use for drought-proofing their property, because cattle don't just put up with but love the mulga.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dan is a very professional person; his farm is meticulous. He has very high standards and he is now applying those to fighting the Queensland government and taking them through the court system because that man has been threatened and served notice of a fine of $126,000 for having the hide to feed his cattle in a drought. He is now going to appeal that and continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Farmers' properties rights have been stolen. The right to use their property, their soil, their water, their vegetation has been taken from them. Where did the theft of these property rights start? Well, Peter Spencer in the 1990s went up a pole and had a hunger strike and nearly died. I think it was Alan Jones who talked him down, because he tried to talk Peter Spencer into realising that he would be better off alive. Peter Spencer has since had many health problems. I met him again recently. He's a wonderful man. He fought hard for those property rights. The reason was: to comply with the UN's Kyoto protocol. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It started with John Howard, who couldn't afford, politically, to shut down plants and industry, so he went after the farmers. He did that because he could get credits for stopping them from clearing land, because the vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide. He then teamed up in 1996, when the Kyoto protocol was signed, with Rob Borbidge, the then Premier of Queensland from the National Party. Then, to seal the deal on protecting so-called native vegetation—but it was really the stealing of farmers' property rights—he signed up with Peter Beattie. Peter Beattie has admitted in writing that he did this to help John Howard's government comply with the Kyoto protocol, ripping farmers' land off them. Bob Carr did the same. He's admitted it publicly. Anna Bligh then continued it as Premier of Queensland. Who caused this? The government caused this, state and federal. Who pays for it? The famers and the people. This is opportunity theft, and it's people like Rick Gurnett, Maurice Newman, Senator Pauline Hanson, Dan McDonald and his family, and Martin Bella who are standing up for this—everyday Aussies who are doing this entirely voluntarily. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is destroying our productive capacity in this country. It is a national disaster. When you look right across the farming sector—and I don't have time to discuss what's happening to the canefarmers now and the magnificent work of Steve Andrew, the One Nation member for Mirani in Central Queensland, and canefarmers like Robert Rossiter and Allan Parker. Again, we have Annastacia Palaszczuk and Jackie Trad stealing property rights and controlling them through supposed runoff restrictions. This was started by the United Nations in 1992 at the UN's Rio de Janeiro declaration for 21st century governance that our Prime Minister at the time, Paul Keating, signed. Again, I ask: who caused it? The government. Who pays for it? The people. It's opportunity theft. We need restoration or compensation for farmers' property rights. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:52</span>):  'Not a single submarine seaworthy'—that was the news broken by Cameron Stewart of <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> on 10 June 2011. He wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For the first time in a generation, Australia does not have a single submarine available to defend the nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence at the time denied it; the minister at the time denied it. But, subsequently, Cameron Stewart was proved right. It was the low point of our submarine force, and it was the low point of ASC in Adelaide. However, a lot has happened since then. We've had the extensive Coles review, commissioned by former Minister for Defence Smith and continued on by Minister for Defence Johnson in the Abbott government. That caused major changes across the submarine enterprise. We've had our full-cycle dockings of our submarines—and, just so everyone understands, that is not an oil change; that is basically a pulling apart of the submarine and putting it back together, brand spanking new. It used to take well in excess of three years. Now, we've got that down to two years. We've had HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Farncomb</span> conduct a two-year full-cycle docking. We've had HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Collins</span> conduct a two-year full-cycle docking, and now we have HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Waller</span> down in Adelaide having its full-cycle docking. They're halfway through and expect, as I understand, that it will be delivered back to the Royal Australian Navy on time. The Royal Australian Navy has never enjoyed the consistent submarine availability at any time in the Collins era as it does now. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In South Australia, ASC have a fantastic workforce of about 900 people keeping one of our key strategic assets at sea available for the Navy. They are operating at or above international benchmarks. So what are the Department of Defence going to do? They're going to disturb that. They have tasked ASC with developing options to send full-cycle docking work to the west in 2022, 2024 or 2026, and I refer to testimony given to the FPA committee just recently. They want to pick up the function and send it from Adelaide to Perth. Well, to the government: there are 900 people that simply will not move. It's the APVMA scenario all over again. We will lose that experience and that corporate knowledge. It will also cost a significant amount of money, probably in the order of billions. And, indeed, it will harm submarine availability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why are they doing this? It's because they want to build the Future Submarines shipyard in and around Adelaide, and for some reason Defence think they can't do that without disturbing the site where the full-cycle dockings take place. ANI, Australian Naval Infrastructure, has testified that there is room down in Adelaide, and the Chief of Navy, at estimates, has testified that there is no naval operational requirement for the shift. Indeed, our Future Submarines, and indeed some of our Collins class submarines, will be based in both Perth and in Sydney with Adelaide in the centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Reynolds: don't fix what is not broken; don't jeopardise our submarine capability. Minister Reynolds, and indeed Minister Cormann as the shareholder minister: the workforce down in Adelaide know what's happening in the background. They've watched what's happened at estimates and they know there are conversations taking place at the moment, and it's demoralising. It's demoralising, and we are losing valuable artificers and valuable engineers with decades of experience. The government must abandon this crazy plan and announce that it is abandoning this crazy plan.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:57</span>):  You might have missed a notable event this month: Australia Post issued a stamp series featuring three freshwater crayfish: <span style="font-style:italic;">Astacopsis gouldi</span>, or the Tasmanian Giant Freshwater Crayfish, which is the biggest freshwater invertebrate in the world; <span style="font-style:italic;">Euastacus sulcatus</span>, the bright blue Lamington crayfish that roams forest floors across the mountains of northern New South Wales and southern Queensland; and <span style="font-style:italic;">Cherax cainii</span>, the WA Smooth Marron.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is fantastic to have this focus on these amazing creatures, particularly the Tasmanian Giant Freshwater Crayfish and the Lamington crayfish, because it's an opportunity to raise the profile of not just how special they are but also how threatened they are. Both these crayfish are threatened by logging. <span style="font-style:italic;">Astacopsis gouldi</span> is the poster cray for the campaign to protect the forests of Northern Tasmania from logging. They live in rivers and creeks in forested areas, and they need to have crystal-clear water, uncontaminated by the sediment that comes from land clearing and logging. This giant crayfish can live to 60 years old and grow to the size of a medium dog. It's classed as 'endangered' by the IUCN, having been wiped out in many catchments where they'd previously lived because of siltation which has clogged up the gaps between the rocks and the pebbles in the creek beds where they live and breed, yet logging is still planned. That will knock off many more of these incredible animals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How about the Lamington crayfish? It is much the same. Scientists who have studied them say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The highly fragmented populations are susceptible to localized impacts, including bushfires, forest management practices, habitat destruction and over exploitation by collectors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Forest management practices? Read: destructive logging. But these amazing animals are now featured on our stamps, so surely that should bring a change of heart here in Canberra, New South Wales and Tasmania? Sadly, no. The Regional Forest Agreements, our destructive logging laws that sanction this logging in Tasmania and New South Wales, have been rolled over for another 20 years, when all the science, all the rational assessment and all the communities that love our forests and wildlife say that they should be scrapped. It's not just the crayfish that are affected. Over the last 20 years our logging laws have allowed logging that's driven species, including koalas, quolls and gliders, closer to the brink of extinction. This logging not only pushes wildlife towards extinction but lowers forest carbon stores and reduces the forests' ability to soak up carbon. Logging impacts on water supplies. It destroys the capacity of these forests to be the centre of recreation and tourism in regional Australia and it destroys the jobs that go with that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Plus, the new laws in New South Wales will permit the government to implement new logging rules that will dramatically intensify logging, including a new intensive harvesting zone, a reduction in stream buffers and further declines in hollow-bearing trees, and these new laws will give them the ability to log trees up to 1.6 metres in diameter. What's even worse is that the New South Wales government is also proposing to remap and rezone forests that have been protected as old growth forests up until now. So say goodbye to the animals in these forests and weep.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what makes me weep the most is that logging our native forests is not needed for wood production. Eighty-eight per cent of timber production in Australia comes from plantations, and this percentage is growing. The vast majority of wood that comes from our native forest logging ends up as woodchips for paper and low-value uses, such as tomato stakes and pallets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to let you know something: Australia is not happy with this. Australians want to see our precious animals protected, our water supplies protected, our precious places for nature walks and scenic drives protected and the places where we are inspired by beauty protected. The community have been campaigning against native forest logging for decades and we will continue. We won't be silenced by big corporate bullyboys and the acolytes in the Liberal, National and Labor parties. Extinction is a political choice. Having giant freshwater crayfish and Lamington crayfish featured on our stamps surely should mean something. So I call on everyone to listen to what's in the post and stamp out— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHELDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:02</span>):  This is not my first speech. I rise tonight to speak about the latest salvo in the coalition government's culture war on working Australians in the form of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment (Ensuring Integrity) Bill. The attacks on working Australians through legislation designed to obstruct their industrial representatives from their core business of dealing with underpayment, stagnant wages and unsafe work practices is part of the culture war the government has set against working people generally in this country. Of course, it's in the make-up of their leadership that this occurs. Whilst the government claim to want to treat unions like corporations, knowing, of course, that unions are elected primarily and appropriately through proper governance procedures in the electoral commission, they've done little to curb the systematic theft of wages and entitlements, namely by criminalising wage theft. They've failed to deal with one of the most criminal, offensive operations that is running rampant across many industries in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Workers are finding their wages stolen. The latest example of this is our celebrity chefs. George Calombaris's hospitality empire, MAdE, was forced to pay close to $8 million in wages and entitlements that had been stolen from employees. Of course, the crime doesn't meet the penalty. What is particularly galling to see is that, after a call from many within the community—many tens of thousands of people signed a petition demanding his sacking from <span style="font-style:italic;">MasterChef</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Australia</span>—the reason he was sacked wasn't because of the stolen wages, heaven forbid. That's just part of running an improper business. He got sacked because he asked for a 40 per cent pay increase that Channel 10 wasn't prepared to pay. Then, of course, you go to other celebrity chefs in this industry, such as Neil Perry. Recent media reports revealed that over $1.6 million worth of wage theft was carried out against his workers in just one year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at this. Say you're a worker. You walk in, and someone says, 'I've got some money in the till.' You steal $10, $20, $30 or $50 from the till. If you get caught, of course you're terminated in most circumstances. I'm not suggesting that's inappropriate. If the employer is particularly vicious over such small amounts, they would also have a right to take that matter to the police, and you could find yourself facing charges—legal action, criminal action—and certainly, for large sums, the potential to be thrown into jail. But, under this government, you can be a celebrity chef and steal $8 million and receive a slap on the wrist from the regulator and a lack of action from this government on dealing with the fundamental issue of wage theft in this country. If you act like a criminal, you should be treated as a criminal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's particularly galling is that all the companies that are doing the right thing—the vast majority of companies that operate within this country—are competing with companies that are stealing from hardworking Australians—stealing their wages, often stealing their superannuation and, of course, often stealing taxes. I'll come back to that great individual Neil Perry. I put this to Qantas, which has Neil Perry as its pin-up person for its business: look at whether you should keep him operating and associate the Qantas name with Neil Perry. There's a need for that company to act. Just as importantly, there's a need for the government to act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question of wage theft was the subject of a 2017 survey by the University of Technology Sydney, the University of New South Wales and the Migrant Worker Justice Initiative. After interviewing 4,322 temporary migrants across 107 nationalities, working in all states and territories across this country, they found workers from Asian countries had the lowest wage rates, compared with those from English-speaking countries. Three-quarters of Asian-background workers earned $17 per hour or less, compared to roughly 35 per cent of American, Irish and British participants. Forty per cent indicated their lowest paid job was in the food services industry as waiters, kitchen hands or food servers. Two-thirds of migrant workers reported that their employer at one point or other failed to provide a pay slip, with 44 per cent reporting that they had never received a pay slip for their work. This is the particularly galling fact that they found in the survey: 28 per cent of workers in the hospitality industry had experienced their employer confiscating their passport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A report by Industry Super found in May 2019 that $6 billion a year in superannuation is stolen from working people in Australia. People earning less than $30,000, aged under 35 or working in blue-collar occupations were the most likely to experience stolen super. More than 2.8 million people in Australia are regularly affected by superannuation theft, but there is no integrity bill. Where is the bill to ensure the integrity of those types of employers that are stealing millions upon millions of dollars from some of the most vulnerable people in our community? Stealing superannuation destroys the dignity of retirement that superannuation provides.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps we should have a 'celebrity chefs ensuring integrity bill' or maybe even, going to another area of politics, a 'Clive Palmer ensuring integrity bill'. Plenty of workers in Queensland would certainly like to be getting their money and seeing consequences for a person who is taking their money and can splash around tens of millions of dollars on an election campaign to get the conservatives elected but not pay his workers and small businesses, including businesses in his own community, the wages and payments that they deserve. Or we could have an 'aged care ensuring integrity bill' after all of the horrific examples—so many examples, including the recent example on the Gold Coast—we have seen over a number of years of how our elderly are poorly treated by these corporations that have moved into these spaces. Again, it's the companies doing the right thing that are affected by the companies doing the wrong thing. It's the companies who provide proper superannuation and proper payments that are unfairly competing with the companies that are stealing from hardworking Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the case of Rockpool Bar and Grill, Mr Karki, who is a chef at Neil Perry's Rockpool Bar and Grill in Melbourne, is pursuing Neil Perry's business for stolen wages. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I slept several nights at Rockpool on a pastry bench because there was no way I could go home and come back in time …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">         …         …         …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I went into depression but I couldn't even figure out if it was a depression. I just wanted to get out but I didn't have any choice because of the 457 visa.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the places I've previously worked, I've had the opportunity to represent workers in the transport industry. The money for this integrity bill will aim to attack working people and their representatives. The transport industry is one where 82 per cent of workers have made serious claims for injury. They account for the highest rate of fatalities—82 per cent across the entire workforce according to a Safe Work Australia report in June 2018—and 54 per cent have made serious claims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know when the trade unions royal commission took place more than $1.2 million was spent by my then employer, the Transport Workers' Union—money that could have been better spent in pursuing those companies that do the wrong thing, in pursuing fair market arrangements that could have lifted everybody to a safer, fairer and more appropriate community. So I say this again: this is a culture war, and it's one that has to come to an end. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:12</span>):  I rise tonight to speak again on the lived experiences of people in our community trying to survive on Newstart and youth allowance. Yesterday I reintroduced the Australian Greens' fifth bill to increase the rate of Newstart and related payments. As I said yesterday, I have received an overwhelming number of messages from the community about their experiences living on Newstart and youth allowance. I also said yesterday that I would continue to share more of their powerful stories with the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard about the damaging and hurtful impacts of Newstart. I heard about the impacts on social and emotional wellbeing, on health, on mental health and on their ability to get by. People have told me what it's like, including many points that I have seen raised by people here. I was told this: 'You feel like a burden to friends because they want to spend time with you, but you can't afford to join them. Or they keep footing the bill for you, and it makes you feel worse. I live in an area where I need my car to get around. I can't even afford to get that serviced, so, if it dies, I'm done for. Getting something nice to spoil yourself could be ordering cheap takeaway food or a packet of chips from Coles or Woolies.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another person said: 'It is demoralising and anxiety ridden. You're always on edge that your payment may be cut for reasons out of your control. You're unable to access the support you need because you're living in relative poverty. Fresh fruit and vegetables become a luxury. Psychological appointments aren't affordable. Clothes for job interviews are difficult to afford, and travel on public transport takes up all your "spare cash". You feel trapped in a hole that you will never claw your way out of.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One young woman shared her difficulties in relying on charities for food and how some charities couldn't help her, because she wasn't a parent: 'You can't live on Newstart, not at all. I was on Newstart for a while. I got rent assistance also. After paying my rent, I was left with $38 a fortnight to pay for groceries, medication, utilities and transport. I ate food cold, as I couldn't afford the power bills to cook it. I went to bed early in winter to try and stay warm, as I couldn't afford heating. I had to rely on charities for groceries, but this depends on where you live. Some charities in some areas provide supermarket vouchers to buy groceries, but the charities in my area couldn't afford to do that, so relied on distributing donated food, which doesn't cater for allergies or dietary requirements. Other charities couldn't help me, as I was a single woman; they would only help those with children. Large charities that are constantly asking for and receiving donations don't operate in my area, so they couldn't help. Paying bills, you are always behind, forever trying to play catch-up, never having enough to pay the bills on time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The utilities that offer discounts for on-time payments—you can't get a discount, because you can't pay on time. And then you had the constant sneering, eye rolling and degrading comments when people find out you're on Newstart. Yes, Newstart is only a payment to get you by until you get a job, but you need to actually be able to get by on it. And you can't. Period.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that living below the poverty line can exacerbate physical and mental health issues. One person told me about the torment they experienced managing their health while on Newstart: 'I've been in hospital over 15 times in the past two years due to my mental health. I'm currently not eligible for the disability pension, so I'm given doctor's notes—therefore, I am living off of Newstart. It is absolutely hell. I don't have enough money to better my situation. There's no way I can afford psychotherapy and there is no medication for my disorder. I have been couch surfing and homeless for a while. I'm extremely suicidal most of the time. Not worrying about what I've got to eat, bus fare and rent would greatly improve the chance of me living a somewhat normal life.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard from somebody else about the constant fear they lived in of being potentially hit by a robo-debt. They said: 'Hell. It's hell. Job search providers don't actually help you find work; they just make appointments without telling you, seemingly at random, and cut your pay. They cut your pay if you don't turn up to the appointment that you didn't know about. You ration out every cent. If you need to buy your medication, you accept that means you'll eat like crap that fortnight. Fruit and vegetables every day feels like a luxury. If your clothes fall apart, you fix them instead of buying new ones. You extend all of your bills, and it forever feels like you're playing catch-up. You're studying, but not enough to be on the study payment, so you're stuck looking for jobs that don't want you anyway. You live in fear of your myGov inbox. You get hit with a Centrelink debt and you sit on the floor and cry because you can't afford to pay them back and you can't afford to live. You feel completely stuck because you can't find work until you finish studying, but you can't keep surviving on Newstart. It's ruining your already fragile mental health. And then you buck up and survive anyway, because it's not like you have a choice in the matter—and, hey, it's "free money" and you should be grateful like everybody tells you to.' Our Prime Minister claims that Australia has one of the best safety nets of anywhere in the world. But how can we have an adequate safety net, let alone the best safety net, if this is what people are experiencing when they're living on Newstart?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> reported analysis by Professor Peter Whiteford, from the Australian National University. Professor Whiteford used OECD data to compare Australia's unemployment payments against other countries'. According to Professor Whiteford's analysis, if you look at the replacement rate, Newstart is the second-lowest unemployment payment in the OECD. If you count rent assistance, then Newstart is the lowest unemployment payment in the OECD. So much for being the best system in the world!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is the wealthiest country in the world, yet we have some of the worst unemployment payments. We must do better. I've committed to keep fighting to preserve our precious social safety net and ensure it continues to support all members of our community who need a hand and who are doing it tough. As you've just heard from those lived experiences—true accounts of people's lives—people are doing it tough on Newstart. You can't have any—any!—quality of life when you live on Newstart. You live from payment to payment. You can't afford your medical bills. For some specialists, as I articulated yesterday, their cost is actually more than a week's Newstart or youth allowance payment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you are not well, that is another barrier to employment. Poverty is a barrier to employment. If you have poor mental health, made worse and exacerbated by trying to survive on Newstart and not being able to afford treatment, that is a barrier to employment. We simply have to do better. Newstart needs to increase. I don't want to spend night after night, year after year, recounting the awful, awful experiences of people on Newstart. But I will, until we get an increase in Newstart and until everybody in this place is sick of the sound of my voice. We will keep campaigning to increase Newstart—not in two or three years time; it needs to happen now. It has not been increased for 25 years, while other salaries and wages have gone up. If we can afford to give $158 billion worth of tax cuts, we can afford to spend the $4 billion that it costs to increase Newstart. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:22</span>):  When Michael and Sharon Camac entrusted the care and support of their son, Eden, to the Bundaberg based Community Lifestyle Support service provider, they expected him to be treated with care, dignity, professionalism and respect. On the night of October 2018 they discovered, however, how extraordinarily that provider had failed in their obligation to support Eden. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was found in his bed in extraordinary pain, having lain there for no less than 10 hours before an ambulance was notified and the family was informed. Arriving at hospital, he was found to have suffered injuries consistent with a severe car crash, having had his pelvis crushed and requiring a significant reconstruction of his hip ligaments, including the insertion of multiple pins. This is a 25-year-old man. If anybody was watching <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span> last week and witnessed the video taken by his terrified mother, Sharon, as he writhed in pain, I'm sure you will share with me a sense of outrage and moral indignation that goes soul deep. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The result of this horrendous mistreatment was only that a support worker was let go. Police dropped charges against that support worker, and the service provider never even reported the incident to the relevant Queensland department, leaving it to his mother to make that report. The department then decided not to pursue an investigation, causing his mother to lodge a complaint. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Camacs have shown incredible courage in telling their story, and so many other stories like theirs are exactly why the disability rights movement, along with the Greens, have been calling so long for a royal commission into disability abuse. The experiences such as they were subjected to are the wellspring of strength to which we have gone back, year after year, in the face of indifference and dismissal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, before the election, the government and the Labor Party were dragged, kicking and legislatively screaming, into a royal commission into this issue. And, finally, after such a long fight there was hope in our community. I cannot describe the joy that was within me at the moment of that announcement. Our community was disappointed that we had not been consulted on the exact composition of the commission, but we were willing to give the government the benefit of the doubt. We were so quickly proven to have been misguided in this trust, as we discovered that there had been two individuals appointed to the commission whose presence jeopardise the entire integrity of a process for which we have so long fought.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, these are not bad people. They have both been committed public servants for most of their careers, but the reality is that they have conflicts of interest that are unmanageable, and they have in the past behaved in a way which gives our community every reason to call into question their ability to undertake these roles. I want to outline these concerns to the Senate briefly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First, Barbara Bennett, PSM, is a longstanding and experienced public servant. But it is for this exact reason that she is inappropriate for this role. The capacity in which she served was that of a member of the Department of Social Services—a senior member of the department which oversees the NDIS and so many other institutional programs and processes that will be the subject of the royal commission. In addition to this she has in the past shown failures in judgement around her engagement with the political side of this place, having once fronted the Work Choices campaign for the Howard government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second appointee with whom we are incredibly concerned is John Francis Ryan, a senior executive member of the bureaucracy of the former New South Wales Department of Community Services. For context: New South Wales and its provision of support for disabled people has resulted in horrific, continued and systemic abuse of such a pervasive nature that the only like example is that of the sexually based child abuse that was experienced by members of the Ballarat community at the hands of the Catholic Church. New South Wales is ground zero for disability abuse in Australia, and John Ryan was an executive member of the public service which was part of that process. Indeed, the programs over which he had direct authority were, unquestionably, linked in an ombudsman's report released last year to the death of two disabled people and the serious injury of a third.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Ryan is well known to the disability community, and when we called him out on these conflicts of interest—when we confronted him with the reality of his past behaviour—he did not listen to us. He did not offer to stand aside but instead engaged in combative online social media commentary with some of the most senior disability advocates in this country, continuing a pattern of social media interactions stretching back for nearly a decade which have very much called into question his ability to be an objective public servant. This includes very worrying commentary about the Islamic community and the role that they play in the so-called need to call for every single Muslim person to condemn continually the actions of Islamic State.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been fighting for this process for so long. We have poured our blood, sweat and tears into it for decades. Our community simply ask that we receive a disability royal commission that has integrity and is able to deliver the justice that we so desperately need. That cannot be done with these two individuals within their places. The disability community is in unanimous agreement. Sixty organisations have signed a joint letter calling for their immediate removal and for their replacement in line with criteria set out by the community. Our demand is simply that you listen to us, that you stop this process of silence and dismissal that leads to our very abuse. That is our simple plea to this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that our community cannot continue this fight alone any longer. It is time for the crossbench and for the Labor Party to assist us in this fight. I tonight call on the Labor Party and those on the crossbench to join with the Greens in our effort to ensure that these two individuals step aside from their positions and that we have the opportunity to appoint folks who do not have conflicts of interest. People like Eden who have suffered as he has suffered deserve nothing less than absolute integrity, complete justice from this, their royal commission.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:32</span>):  I rise to speak tonight about an important event that occurred this month, called NAIDOC Week. I hope that senators here were able to take part in NAIDOC ceremonies, whether it was in there respective states or electorates or cities or towns, because it's an important week certainly to First Nations people across the country but also I think for our country. NAIDOC has been celebrated for a very long time, but this year the important theme that came from the National NAIDOC Committee was 'Voice. Treaty. Truth'. The reason why the National NAIDOC committee chose that was, simply:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We invite you to walk with us in a movement of the Australian people for a better future—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For a better future—to walk with us in a movement for a better future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was able to be on the lands of the Yanyuwa and Garrwa people for NAIDOC Week. They are the lands of my people in Borroloola in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Whilst there are so many issues still facing First Nations people across the country, there is no doubt that this week is an opportunity to celebrate and feel proud of the resilience, strength and ongoing culture of First Nations people. From Borraloola across to Katherine and the Barkly region of Tennant Creek up to Larrakia country and then of course around Arrernte country in Central Australia in Alice Springs and beyond, NAIDOC week was celebrated across the Northern Territory in a very strong and proud way. In Alice Springs we had the Tangentyere Women's Group, who led and were very much a part of the celebrations that took place in Alice Springs. One of the big things I think at the end of that week was the announcement of where national NAIDOC is going to take place next year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very pleased to inform the Senate that national NAIDOC will be held in Alice Springs next year on Mbantua country. Mbantua is the language name by the Arrernte people of Alice Springs. And, speaking of languages, that is a critical part of this year's NAIDOC in the celebration which we all know to be recognised at the United Nations this year with the celebration of languages. And certainly, just in the Northern Territory alone, we have over 100 Aboriginal languages. So of course that was a very strong theme, again, as part of Voice. Treaty. Truth: the celebration of language and the celebration of having language, being heard, being able to speak and also being able to maintain and retain languages that are so desperately needed to keep languages strong here in this country. We should be proud, as should all Australians, to know these different First Nations languages are critical to the ongoing future of First Nations people here but also our country in walking together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Voice. Treaty. Truth. resonated right across the country in the marches that took place, mostly on the Friday of that week, in Darwin on Larrakia country. It was perhaps one of the biggest marches that we've seen in quite a long time. I certainly commend the Top End NAIDOC committee and the Larrakia Nation, on whose land the march took place. Once the march was completed, a family day was held out on the Darwin Esplanade, and it was fantastic. It was fantastic not only for the families who had marched and come together but for all people who wanted to come along and actually learn about Voice. Treaty. Truth., to listen to some of the talks, to ask questions—which is what it's all about: an inclusive process, an opportunity to be more informed and, hopefully, better informed in terms of the movement that is growing very, very strongly as a result of people gathering at Uluru in 2017.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As for, the Uluru Statement from the Heart for which so many hundreds of First Nations people gathered around Uluru in May 2017, since then, that movement has grown, and the movement needs to be more of the people's movement, because we here in both the Senate and the House are still struggling with the fact that the Statement from the Heart came from the heart, from people who want the parliament to listen to the calls for a voice to the parliament. It is not a third chamber to the parliament. It is most definitely not a third chamber. And I do acknowledge that Barnaby Joyce, the member in the other house, has now said that he apologises for having called it a third chamber of the parliament. I accept that. I take that. I think that, the more informed people can be, hopefully, this debate can rise to a particular level that enables First Nations people to feel like they're being heard and know they are being heard and, most importantly, feel respected in the fact this has been a journey that began with First Nations people asking all Australians to walk with us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sure, there's a fair bit to navigate through, and I know that the Minister for Indigenous Australians made a statement during the week in relation to this in terms of a voice to the parliament and constitutional conversations. I know too that Linda Burney, as our shadow Indigenous affairs minister, and certainly the Labor Party have consistently stayed strong behind the fact that the voice is something that the First Nations people have asked for since 2017. We remain committed to that, but we're also committed to the fact that we have to do that together here in the parliament. I do commend the work of Ken Wyatt in trying to bring about greater understanding amongst his own colleagues, because that's what we're going to need more of: the conversations and the discussions. But, as I said, it must be in a way that enables First Nations people to lead that so that there can be respectful debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I read articles that make references to the fact that this isn't what people wanted, a voice isn't the way to go, I would say to them: 'Just take a deep breath and have a really good look around you.' This is a journey that may have started with the Uluru Statement in 2017 but it goes way beyond that. In the last sitting of parliament we paid our condolences to former Prime Minister Bob Hawke. We know that the treaty statement at Barunga in 1988 began that journey for the parliament but, for First Nations people, it began way before then. In fact, you could go back, certainly, to the bark petition in the sixties. We know the bark petition was an important petition brought here to the parliament by the Yolngu people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">NAIDOC week is not just a week to march; it's a week that says, from First Nations people to all Australians, we've got a way to go but we still need to do this together and we still need to have our voices heard to be empowered. These are the people who have come to Uluru, the people who still stand and call on the parliament to have a voice, to be included. As a parliamentarian, I look forward to this parliament being able to do that with First Nations people in this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:41</span>):  I rise this evening to speak on the important issue of religious freedom. I recently launched a petition calling for a religious freedom act. Enshrined in this act should be the right to the freedom of speech, thought, conscience and religion. I would like to thank people from across Australia who have called my office, who supported my incentive and who are actively engaged in getting signatures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an issue primarily of freedom of speech, of which religious freedom is a component. This debate in Australia has its genesis in the same-sex marriage postal survey conducted in 2017. I and others warned that religious freedom issues needed to be considered at that time, due to the significant and complicated legal consequences of same-sex marriage. These warnings were ignored, and now we are attempting to unscramble the egg. I encourage all who believe in freedom of speech to continue to sign and mail the petition to my electoral office as soon as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A federal religious freedom act would ensure consistency and applicability across all arms of government in Australia. When freedom of speech, thought, conscience and belief is framed only as an exemption to other rights, they are read down against positive rights, rendering them subordinate to those other rights. A regime of positive rights in the form of religious freedom legislation would give effect to the right to manifest one's freedom of thought, conscience and belief, as outlined in article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to thank people of faith across Australia as well as those who have no faith but believe in freedom for supporting my initiative. I thank Dr Norman Lee and many of the people who work with him, who have also assisted me and continue to assist me in this endeavour; thank you for your commitment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I speak with religious leaders and their organisations, they are calling for robust positive protections enshrined in law, not merely as grudging exemptions. They want a positive right that allows people to live in accordance with their convictions. And, while religious leaders may have theological differences, there is strong solidarity amongst them, unified in their fight to protect freedom of speech and freedom of religion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The need for positive religious freedom legislation is due to the growing body of cases in Australia of people facing harassment, intimidation and persecution because of their religious beliefs and actions. Some are even losing their livelihoods. Organisations such as the Australian Christian Lobby and the Institute for Civil Society have been cataloguing the growing number of cases of religious discrimination and religious freedom incursions over the last three years. In addition, organisations such as the Human Rights Law Alliance have been busy fighting for and defending the rights and religious freedoms of individuals or organisations in various courts throughout Australia. </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are all familiar with the current case of Israel Folau. We are also familiar with previous cases, such as efforts to deregister Dr Pansy Li or to boycott products made by Coopers Brewery due to their perceived views of not supporting same-sex marriage. However, there have been a plethora of other cases, not only in Australia but in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada and the United States of America. While these cases in Australia have not attracted as much attention, they are just as important to be aware of. These cases have not been reported in the mainstream media. Alarmingly, they continue to increase in frequency. Tonight I would like to highlight some of these cases. The education system has become a battleground for students and teachers because they dare to profess their faith or express an alternative point of view. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Andrew—not his real name—is a Christian student at an Australian university. In a discussion with his classmates, Andrew stated that he would show love to a gay friend but not necessarily agree with his lifestyle. His classmate felt unsafe and complained to the university. Consequently, the university suspended Andrew pending an investigation, amongst other sanctions. Lawyers associated with the Human Rights Law Alliance represented Andrew to secure a reversal of the university decision. One could not imagine the emotional and financial stress suffered by Andrew. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dan—not his real name—is a teacher. In 2016, during the same-sex marriage postal vote process, he posted links to articles about homosexual marriage. Consequently, he was reported to the education department and subjected to a long investigation. This investigation only stopped when Dan obtained legal representation. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Barry—not his real name—is a lecturer at a tertiary institution. He was officially warned by his employer not to share his religious beliefs about Jesus and threatened with discipline and employment termination. Barry has sought legal assistance to protect his employment. This case is ongoing. It is happening now. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Small business is supposed to be Australia's engine of economic growth and employment. Instead, small business owners and operators are spending precious time and resources defending themselves from intimidation, harassment and legal action. In 2018, Jason Tey, who is a Christian and a Perth based wedding photographer, was approached by a same-sex couple requesting he photograph their children. Jason expressed he had a conflict of belief regarding same-sex marriage, and maybe the couple should hire someone else. Consequently, one of the mothers of the children pursued legal action against Jason. Jason refused to apologise. The complainant eventually withdrew her legal action, but for Jason this consumed seven months of his life. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">People are losing their jobs because they are professing values supposedly not acceptable in the workplace. Clara—not her real name—is a mental health counsellor who dared to share her Christian views on sexuality and gender via social media. Consequently, a progressive political activist complained, and she lost her teaching qualification. She has been denied her livelihood. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jarrod—not his real name—is a medical doctor. Jarrod, via social media, posted Orthodox Christian beliefs and scientific facts relating to gender and sexuality. Subsequently, the Medical Board instigated an investigation following a complaint. Jarrod may lose his ability to practice medicine. This is another ridiculous example of a person potentially being denied their livelihood. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ryan—not his real name—was a general manager in a digital services agency in Victoria. When Ryan was asked about the Safe Schools Coalition, he stated that gender fluidity and sexual diversity conflicted with his values. As a consequence, Ryan's employment was terminated because his comments 'created an unsafe workplace'. Ryan successfully pursued legal action against his employer. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chris, not his real name, was a Commonwealth government employee. His work managers and colleagues put pressure on him to affirm same-sex lifestyles by marching in a pride parade and subscribing to a pride email newsletter. Such sentiments and actions were against his cultural beliefs and heritage. He raised concerns. His Commonwealth government workplace officially warned him and initiated a further investigation for suspected breaches of the Public Service Code of Conduct. Chris obtained legal representation; the investigation was dropped and no further action was taken.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I provide one last and very sad case. A couple wanted to provide the gift of happiness to a child with no parents. Chris and Mary, not their real names, are Christian parents who made an application to foster young children. The child foster agency denied their application due to their orthodox Christian views on gender and sexuality being classified as unsafe.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All these examples, past or present, exhibit the same factors: the victims innocently expressed their values, either in an education or in an employment setting. The victims did not resort to forms of intimidation, harassment, persecution or even violence. In fact, they were targets of the same and punished to such an extent that some of them have lost their livelihoods. This is no dream; it is a reality. For those involved it has become a nightmare. This is supposed to be modern-day Australia, supposedly democratic and free. But this was not the case and isn't the case for these people. You or I could be the next victims. All of these unfortunate cases illustrate why religious freedom protections are necessary in Australia today.</span>
