I think it might be useful to put on the record the history of this legislation because if there is anyone holding up the passage of important reforms to transport security clearances it is the Liberal-National government. Let's understand the background of this bill. Similar bills have been introduced in the 44th and 45th parliaments and both failed to pass the parliament. In the 44th Parliament the bill was put forward, Labor senators provided additional comments at a Senate inquiry and the bill was allowed by the Liberal-National government to lapse at the election. We had the 2016 election and this bill which is before the parliament was allowed by this government, this Liberal and National government, to lapse at the election. In the 45th Parliament, Labor supported the legislation in principle, but successfully amended it in 2017 with support from the Greens and Senator Lambie and we have here that One Nation senators did not vote on that amendment. The bill was also amended by then Senator Leyonhjelm. What happened to that bill in the 45th Parliament? The bill was allowed to lapse by the Morrison government at the 2019 election. </span>

They had a similar bill in the 44th Parliament; they allowed it to lapse. They had a similar bill in the 45th Parliament; they allowed it to lapse. I'm not going to stand here and be lectured by a Liberal-National government that, for some six years now, has had half-hearted attempts to get a transport security bill up in the parliament and keeps letting it lapse, that does not even have the courage to put it forward for a vote. This current bill, introduced to the 46th Parliament, is largely similar to the other bills. There are some changes that have been highlighted in Senate inquiries. More than three years had passed since the legislation was last reviewed by a Senate committee, which is why it was referred to a Senate inquiry again. In that inquiry, there were a number of issues raised about the fact that the bill didn't even have a definition of 'serious crime' even though the bill was called the serious crime amendment, and that the bill did absolutely nothing to address the gaping hole that sits in this legislation around foreign crew on flag-of-convenience vessels. That gaping hole wasn't pointed out by the Labor Party; it wasn't pointed out by the unions; it was pointed out by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection and the national security agencies upon which this parliament should be taking its advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As this bill went through the House of Representatives earlier this year, it was the government that moved another amendment to the bill. It was the government that added something onto the bill. Since what they added on was an entirely new process to do with criminal intelligence assessments, an inquiry was supported by the Senate to look at that very issue. Let me be clear: we didn't relish the idea of having to go off to another inquiry. It was the mismanagement of the Liberal and National government with their own legislation; the fact that they introduced legislation that wasn't finished into the House of Representatives and the Senate after the Senate inquiry. Then they go and move an amendment to their own legislation. This Senate, with the support of the crossbench, agreed to another inquiry into that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government had had their act together and put the legislation fully formed before the parliament we might have had a more efficient process. If the government had had their act together and actually put the legislation as amended by this Senate in the last parliament, if they'd put that legislation to a vote, if they'd accepted the amendments, we would have had this regime in place. It is entirely within the discretion of the Liberal-National government, the Morrison government, which sets the agenda in the parliament, to determine whether bills come forward for a vote. They let it lapse in the 44th Parliament, they let it lapse in the 45th Parliament and then they completely mismanaged the process in this parliament. I'm tempted to say it's like a clown car of ministers over there, running around trying to work out what to do with their own legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While all this mismanagement is happening, we had the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, last week in a clumsy misfire trying to say that Labor is responsible for holding up the national security legislation. It was a clumsy and stupid statement by the Prime Minister. He cited three bills. He cited the Surveillance Legislation Amendment (Identify and Disrupt) Bill 2020. That is currently with the PJCIS, a Liberal dominated committee. He cited the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (International Production Orders) Bill 2020. That was the subject of a bipartisan, unanimous report by the PJCIS recommending the bill be passed subject to legislative and non-legislative changes, and the government haven't even responded to that report yet. The Prime Minister doesn't even know what his own members are doing on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. He seems ignorant of the fact that the PJCIS had a unanimous recommendation supporting the passage of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's not be lectured by the Prime Minister on who is doing what in relation to national security, when he seems completely unaware of what is happening with various pieces of national security legislation. If he had been truthful with the Australian people, he would have acknowledged that it was his government that let the transport security bill lapse at the 2019 election. It was his government that mismanaged this legislation through the parliament. It was his government that brought forward an additional amendment requiring the Senate to have to look at a new process through an inquiry. Let's not be lectured by this government that somehow the appropriate scrutiny that opposition and crossbenchers apply to this bill is somehow holding it up. It is entirely the Liberal-National government, the Morrison government, that is holding up this legislation. If it had just fixed the foreign crew issue in this legislation that the Department of Immigration and Border Protection flagged as a 'gaping hole' in the regime at our ports and airports, this bill would have already been passed. Let's take no lectures from Mr Morrison on national security legislation. He doesn't know what he is talking about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to point out that the government, which sets the agenda in the Senate, found time this year to prioritise superyacht legislation. It's great that the Senate has dealt with superyachts! We have not yet dealt with national security clearances at our ports and our airports. They set the agenda, they allocate the time and they make those decisions. Why have they prioritised superyacht legislation over the fundamental need to have appropriate security clearance regimes in place at our ports and airports?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday Minister Michaelia Cash made statements that foreign crew are constantly supervised—that they must be always supervised at maritime ports when they are in a secure area. My question to the minister at the table is: can she confirm that foreign crew do not require additional security checks because they will always be under constant supervision while they are in a maritime port?</span>

Yesterday Senator Seselja confirmed that the Geelong port is a secure zone and that all people in the zone are required to have an MSIC or be escorted by an officer who has an MSIC.

At approximately 2 am on Sunday 13 June, two sailors, who have only been described in media reports as 'Asian', reportedly crept at pace down a gangway and a set of stairs before disappearing into the night. This is on Sunday 13 June, a few days ago—not last year and not in 2016 but a couple of days ago. After that, it's speculated these two sailors jumped onto the beach and escaped along the foreshore or scaled a standard barbed wire fence to make their getaway. At the time the Australian Border Force did not alert the local community.</span>

I will come to the identity, because I do have some further information for the chamber on that. But I would again counsel Labor against deliberately conflating two very separate issues. You've got the maritime crew visas, of which the two crew members mentioned were holders, and I understand those visas have now been cancelled. Again you are conflating it with the requirement for an MSIC. As Senator Seselja said yesterday, as I understand it, part of the port of Geelong is a secured area, but part of it is not. Regardless, any foreign crew need to have a visa. Through you, Chair: Senator Keneally can keep filibustering by being completely insulting to the minister, to the Prime Minister and to many others, but it does not change the fact that those opposite have had five years to consider this legislation, and endless filibustering does not make our ports any safer. </span>

At approximately 10 o'clock yesterday, ABF, VicPol and DHHS were notified that these two members were unaccounted for during their morning crew muster. ABF officers boarded the vessel to conduct the master's questionnaire and relevant ship search at approximately midday—just after midday. ABF officers cancelled or ceased the crew members' visas. The master advised the ABF that the crew were in possession of their passports, which they had obtained from the master's cabin, where the passports had been secured. The master advised that one of the missing crew cleans the master's cabin daily and noted that that was likely how he had obtained the two passports. </span>

Senator Keneally, your concern about the time it took the ABF to get back to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Geelong Advertiser</span> is noted. But I would also note that their primary responsibility is to do exactly what they did yesterday: to work with VicPol and other relevant authorities to investigate this. Again, it is a valiant effort you are putting up to filibuster on this and to conflate these two issues, but they are two separate issues.</span>

                    </a>  I will take that interjection from the minister. She seems not to have listened to the fact that it was her government that allowed this bill to lapse at the 2016 election. They didn't bring it forward for a vote. Minister, how can Labor be holding up something that your government doesn't bring forward for a vote? Further, your government let it lapse at the 2019 election. The Morrison government let this bill lapse at the 2019 election, after Labor had already voted for it. It was amended, and, in a fit of petulance and stubbornness, the Morrison government didn't accept the amendments. They didn't even deal with them; they just let the bill lapse. Let's understand this, Minister: this bill would be law today if your government had not let it lapse at two elections. </span>

Yes, this bill has been hanging around for five years, because they let it hang around for five years. They haven't done the work. They mismanaged it. They amended their own bill halfway through the parliamentary debate.</span>

I think it is reasonable to have more than one hour of debate on a piece of national security legislation, especially when we have a circumstance that makes the very point that the opposition and crossbench have been raising, and that is that the regime that exists around maritime crew visas is not sufficient. These aren't my words, Minister; these are the words of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. In 2017 it made clear that the regulatory regime and the practices around foreign crew allow for the importation of drugs, weapons and other illegal activities, and this bill doesn't do anything about solving that—it doesn't.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, what have we seen? Your government and your border protection in the last few days have seen foreign crew abscond from a ship in an Australian port. If you think I'm not going to raise that, you've got to be kidding. This is the fundamental part of the bill. The minister just provided some additional information about these two crew members on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Glorious Plumeria</span>. I thank her for the information. It's a pity it couldn't have been provided to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Geelong Advertiser</span>, who I'm sure are watching this debate and may well be able to make use of that information, since they didn't get it through their inquiries, because the local community in Geelong are interested in this; Australians are interested in this. How is it the case that our borders are so porous that two crew members can just wander off a ship?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister said in her answer that somehow these two crew members got hold of their passports while one of them was cleaning the master's cabin. I believe that is the information she provided. It's my understanding that these passports are meant to be held in a safe on board a ship. Is the minister saying that the passports were not being held as they should have been on the vessel?</span>

Can I address what Senator Keneally has also alleged, saying that this legislation does nothing to fix the serious problems that we have at our ports? That is simply and utterly not true. Instead of calling for endless reviews, which Labor does all the time, I can confirm that we know there are over 200 individuals with links to serious and organised crime holding ASICs and MSICs, and I believe up to 70 per cent of those actually hold the MSIC. These individuals can currently access secure and sensitive areas of airports and seaports without supervision. We also know that serious and organised criminals use our airports and seaports as transit points to import weapons, illicit drugs and other harmful goods into Australia. Trafficking of these illegal goods puts Australian security and prosperity and the welfare of our communities at great risk.</span>

These amendments will also provide ACIC with the ability to conduct criminal intelligence assessments for use in background checks on both cards. This is important. It is clearly needed, and this government is keen to get this through as soon as possible. No more stalling. No more delay tactics from those opposite. This bill must be passed.</span>

We just think it should be strengthened. There's no review being called for here. The only review that got called for by this Senate was because your government, the Morrison government, didn't present their legislation fully formed to the parliament; they amended it after they introduced it. It is laughable that the government sit here and insist that somehow this is some kind of model legislative process they've gone through and the rest of us are just standing in the way. What we are trying to do here is deal with what you put forward, which was a half-formed piece of legislation. You amended it halfway through the legislative process. We've held an additional inquiry, supported by the crossbench in the Senate. We think this bill should be strengthened. We're not calling for an additional review.</span>

Again, I'm not making this claim. Senator Sheldon isn't making it. Senator Rice isn't making it. Senator Hanson isn't making it. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection is making it. We take that seriously. Whether they take that seriously is up to them, and we'll see, when we vote on this amendment, where they come down.</span>

Again, that matter, while important—and it's important for ABF and law enforcement to deal with—is detracting very effectively, I would argue, from Labor's calls to split the aviation and maritime sections of the bill.

It should be of great concern to all Australians that it is the Labor Party who are seeking to have them exempted by the application of their amendments, and I think that is absolutely outrageous. Kilograms of illicit goods enter Australia through airports but tonnes enter through containers through our seaports. We have to close off all entry points to trusted insiders and serious criminals, not just those in the aviation sector. Otherwise, organised criminals will continue to exploit Australia's ports. There will be only one party to blame for that, and that is the Labor Party, which is seeking to split this bill and water down the impact of this legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What has happened at Geelong? Two foreign crew, who have not been MSIC checked, who have not had the more rigorous check, have now absconded into the Australian community. What was the response from the government and the ABF? It's taken them days to start responding to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Geelong Advertiser</span>, days to start making public announcements about what is happening with those two individuals and days to give any sort of indication as to who these people are. What's particularly worrying is the government's politicising of the ABF. You would have thought that, when two people were found to have absconded from a ship, the government would have notified the public and asked for the public's involvement. But they didn't do that because they wanted to hush it up. National security is not an issue when they want to hush something up. Quite clearly, this government is making sure that there is still access to our ports for foreign crews who are carrying out criminal activities—gun running and the sorts of things that put our country in jeopardy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this point, those two people and what their motivation is haven't been identified. But what has been demonstrated is that they could have been terrorists, they could have been importing drugs or they could have been gun running. What do ABF do? They don't notify the public. These are the people at the forefront of national security, yet they don't notify the public that there has been a breach of our national borders. They hush it up because of politics—not in the interests of national security but because they wanted to make sure they weren't held to account for the failings in the system which we've been highlighting in the past 24 hours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is critical that these maritime crew visas be upgraded and reviewed, and not only in light of the fact of what's happened in Geelong. As we discussed yesterday, last year Rio Tinto had eight ships off Queensland. Four were Australian vessels with Australian crew with MSIC passes, the high background checks. The four others were flag-of-convenience vessels with foreign crew and low security checks. If you want our borders to be secure then make them secure by making sure the standards apply to foreign crews as well. That will protect the community. That will protect all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To go back to the case in Geelong, we have seen Border Force refuse to give details of the two Asian sailors who are still at large after abandoning ship in Geelong, something that is keeping the community on edge over whether the duo is dangerous or carrying COVID-19. That's from a report just this morning in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Geelong Advertiser</span>. So here's the <span style="font-style:italic;">Advertiser</span>, a major communication network, making sure it announces it to the public, to the local community in Geelong—'Keep an eye out; this is critical'—while the government keep trying to hush it up. They haven't made people in Geelong aware for many, many hours and, of course, there's still no detail. 'But don't worry,' we heard yesterday. 'We don't have to actually escort a foreign crew member on a maritime crew visa, because they're supervised by somebody on an MSIC card.' One of the comments made in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Geelong Advertiser</span>, which I take to be accurate, was:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's understood security footage showed the pair creep at pace down a gangway and set of stairs before disappearing into the night.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where was the surveillance? It wasn't there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing that's particularly disturbing about this is that over the past five years we've had evidence and more evidence about these foreign crews breaching security at our ports. Of course, the government didn't act. Why didn't they act? Because they say that it's too complicated and it actually involves too many resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is a government that has the hide to say it is protecting our borders. It didn't notify the local community for many hours. It still hasn't given details days after these people absconded. Here is a government that has turned around and said that it's too expensive to make sure our border is secure. When we're talking about potential gun running, terrorist activities and drug running is it too expensive? They do not have a system in place. This amendment proposes the government having a system in place that is properly considered to make sure our ports are protected and we have security at our ports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last days they have said that there's a conspiracy about why we want changes. Why we want changes is self-evident. We want changes because they secure our borders, they secure Geelong and they secure our community. As I raised yesterday, we have large amounts of ammonium nitrate being moved around on coastal shipping by foreign crews. None of them are security checked. Only about a third of that tonnage of ammonium nitrate was involved in the unfortunate incident in Beirut that caused the devastation and terrible loss of life. It was horrific. If that were to get in the hands of a terrorist, it would be extremely horrific in any country, but particularly this country. But they say, 'Don't worry; we haven't done security checks on them.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We get 24 or 48 hours notice that these people have been given a low-level security check. We've seen in Geelong how that low-level security check works. It doesn't work. We've seen in Geelong how the supervision and oversight of people who don't have MSICs doesn't work. We've seen another instance where our borders have been put at risk by this government's lack of action. They're hiding behind politics and engaging in cheap political point-scoring rather than making a decision to make our borders secure and support the very sensible amendment that has been put up by Labor. We will secure our borders. We will protect our borders. We will protect them from foreign seafarers, not only Australian seafarers, if there is a concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite clearly, the government has failed to act in an appropriate way to make sure the border is protected. As I said, we've seen the Rio Tinto example and we've seen examples at the RRAT inquiry. In response to question on notice No. 3 in the RRAT inquiry, Home Affairs also admitted that foreign crew are not subjected to routine—as we've seen—bag checks or inspections for drugs, weapons or other contraband. There are no metal detectors to detect other weapons being imported into the country and no checks by drug detector dogs. These are the people protecting our border. They talk about the ways and means of securing our borders. Instead of pretending to secure our borders, they should be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, is it the government's intention to review the maritime crew visa? I noted yesterday that they said they have not done a review of the maritime crew visa whilst doing an assessment of what should happen at our ports and security. They are leaving the bulk of the people left behind. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Labor have filibustered—and both senators this morning have continued their heroic efforts to filibuster on this bill—and have tried to water down the bill by splitting it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to some of your comments or your assertions, Senator Sheldon, I think it is highly insulting and in fact demeaning to be so rude about the ABF staff and criticise their professionalism. They do an extraordinary job for our nation. In relation to some of your assertions, ABF officers do conduct regular visits to any vessel of interest. They do conduct regular wharf patrols and provide a high-visibility presence. They maintain a periodical or permanent ABF-marked-vehicle presence at the gangways and they also seek continuous CCTV monitoring of vessel gangways by the Customs National Monitoring Centre. In response to all of your assertions about their competence, they do a magnificent job on behalf of our nation and they do take security of our ports seriously.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, there's only one side of politics that's seeking to delay this bill or to have this bill not pass the Senate, and that's Labor. As I've said, of 227 ASIC and MSIC cardholders of concern to the ACIC, 73 per cent are in the maritime sector. This is exactly the reason we want this bill passed, so that we can implement these measures and so that law enforcement can make sure that people like that no longer have access to secure areas of our ports. As Labor keeps conflating them, let me be very clear: we're talking about these cards in the secure areas of our ports, not the more general access that we're talking about through the MCVs.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:11</span>):  The minister has made several statements about the ACIC assessments in maritime ports. The very amendment that we are dealing with, which is my amendment on sheet 1117, actually only deals with schedule 1. If the amendment were accepted, it won't deal with schedule 2, which means that the criminal intelligence matters that you point out can go ahead in maritime ports. Unfortunately, I don't think the minister has properly read the amendment and I think that demonstrates yet again the lack of attention to detail the government has when it comes to this legislation. They let the bill lapse in 2016, they let the bill lapse in 2019. They brought it to the parliament in this term of parliament, the 46th Parliament, and then they amended their own legislation halfway through, causing the Senate, including the crossbench, to vote for an additional inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They don't seem to understand that what Labor is seeking to do here is to take what we see as a good bill and make it better. That's what this is about: strengthening the security clearances at our borders. We say their bill has good intention. We supported it in the 45th Parliament. It's not our fault that the Morrison Government let the bill lapse in 45th Parliament. They control the agenda; they determine what legislation goes forward. They let it lapse. They write the bills. In the 46th Parliament, this parliament, they presented a bill that was half-finished. They amended it part way through. The amendment that I'm moving would allow the entire regime to be implemented immediately for aviation. It only affects schedule 1, not schedule 2, so the concerns the minister raises around criminal intelligence assessments can be dealt with for maritime workers as well. What we're seeking to do is to get the government to acknowledge what the former Department of Immigration and Border Protection had already said. The minister wasn't here yesterday, so let me make clear for her what the then Department of Immigration and Border Protection told the Senate Standing Committees on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee in 2017. I note no minister has wanted to touch this advice with a barge pole in this debate. They seem to want to ignore the fact that a national security agency, one that is concerned with border security, has given clear evidence to this chamber that there's a hole in our border security. The minister says that somehow the hole exists from the opposition crossbench asking legitimate questions. Let me read to the minister what the then Department of Immigration and Border Protection said to this chamber in 2017:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are features of flag of convenience registration, regulation and practice that organized crime syndicates or terrorists may seek to exploit.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Reduced transparency or secrecy surrounding complex financial and ownership arrangements are factors that can make flag of convenience ships more attractive for use in illegal activity, including by organized crime or terrorist groups. This means that FOC ships may be used in a range of illegal activities, including illegal exploitation of natural resources, illegal activity in protected areas, people smuggling, and facilitating prohibited imports or exports …</span>

This bill was developed in response to a number of independent reviews that recognised the critical vulnerability created by serious and organised criminals exploiting the ASIC and MSIC schemes for criminal purposes. The government does acknowledge that flag-of-convenience ships can also pose a risk to the maritime environment that can be exploited by these very same organised crime groups. The government regularly reviews the aviation and maritime environments to address all vulnerabilities and to strengthen aviation and maritime security.</span>

Senator Keneally's amendment links the commencement of this bill to her own private member's bill, the Migration Amendment (New Maritime Crew Visas) Bill 2020, which proposes amendments to the maritime crew visa. The new MCV bill provides that the transport security amendment bill would only commence on the passage of her own bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The vast majority of MCV holders do not require unescorted access to maritime security zones—again, I remind those opposite that these are two different issues that you are valiantly trying to conflate—and requiring visa holders to comply with elements of the MSIC scheme could pose a significant financial burden on the administration of the MCV scheme for absolutely no discernible benefit. It would cause a completely unacceptable level of uncertainty and further delay for industry for the government to link both the MCV and the MSIC as well as the commencement of the bills. This is just another delaying tactic by those opposite. I would just say, please just pass the bill, stop filibustering and stop playing games, so that we can get on and deal with the ASIC and MSIC cards and get serious and organised criminals out of our secure areas in our ports, airports and seaports.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="168275" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHELDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  I want to go to a couple of things the minister has just stated in answering a series of questions, including those ones there. They don't want maritime crew visas to be at the same level as Australian crew visa checks. They have said clearly, as I've already stated to Senator Seselja and Senator Cash yesterday, that both of them recognise the fact that the MCV is a dud scheme. It's a scheme that does not give the same virility that we require for ASICs and MSICs, and specifically on our ports. One of the reasons they keep pressing, and the minister keeps pressing now, is that we have surveillance. People don't turn around and walk onto a wharf because they have criminal activity in mind. They go and get an MSIC or an ASIC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, quite clearly, when we're dealing with security on our ports, we have to look at the serious nature of those people who are on the ships. It is a serious issue. I remind the minister that on 12 March 2021 exceptionally good work was done, as I recognised yesterday, by the Australian Federal Police, the ABF and New South Wales State Crime Command when they intercepted 200 kilos of cocaine. How did they intercept it? They intercepted it in a number of ways. What became clear is that those drugs were being dropped off the back of the ship—that's what the report says—to a daughter ship. That is the language they used. That boat then brought in the drugs. The crew members who handed over the drugs and were part of the arrangement were people who did not have a requirement to have appropriate and proper security checks done and would not have a capacity to have this done if the government were to pass the amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about actually making sure that our ports are secure and that there are proper assessments—not an assessment, but proper assessments—ones that actually make sure that our borders are appropriately and properly protected. We've seen a series of questions that were raised by the Border Force, and I take the minister on face value. I have a lot of time for Border Force, but I have to say this: one of two things happened in Geelong. Either Border Force has been failing on the job or the government has interfered in the notification regarding this incident at this particular port, because they still have not turned around and answered a series of important questions raised by their community. A series of critical issues raised the things that need to be known in the Geelong community to make a difference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's incredibly important that people in Geelong have confidence that we have a proper system, as we have in the rest of Australia—a system that actually can make sure that those crew members have been checked and that, when something's dropped off the back of a ship, we have a chance to turn around and find the potential culprits before any culprits are involved. It's important that we turn around and have those unescorted crew members from foreign crews properly checked. It is a bit of a no-brainer. If you're a criminal, you don't get an ASIC or an MSIC; you don't apply for one. They're saying, 'Let's leave to it the criminals to decide whether they should have a higher degree of security check.' Can you believe it? We're going to ask the criminals whether they want to have a higher security check. Guess what the answer will be? No. It's obvious. It's what happens. It's practical. I don't even have to watch crime shows to know that. It's just common sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have to turn around and have a proper approach and a proper understanding of how they're dealing with these issues. They need to make sure, whether it be with Rio Tinto last year off the coast of Queensland, where four ships turned around and had MSIC security checks, because Australian crewed ships, including the companies they work for, are very mindful of the necessity for and the capacity of crew members to move around areas unescorted. They're also very mindful that there will be a higher level of scrutiny of the people who are on their ships. But what do we do when it comes to foreign ships? We say, 'We don't care. Rip it and burn.' No, sorry, we don't quite say that. We say, 'If you're a criminal, you can apply for one and be more highly security checked.' It is ludicrous!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From answers from questions yesterday, we quite clearly have the situation in our ports now where dozens of people can be not security checked up to the standard that's required. They can be on an MCV. They can be moving on and off our ports. But don't worry, as the minister said in the answer to one of questions earlier from Senator Keneally, not only do we close off all entry points—it didn't happen in Geelong; it didn't actually happen off the coast of Queensland last year either; it didn't happen in Port Botany. We haven't closed off all the points. In actual fact, you've got a ripping hole in the security of our country because you're not turning around and taking an appropriate stance on what is a very practical and sensible proposition from Labor. Why aren't they doing it? Are they covering up for cocaine dealers? I don't think that's correct. Are they not doing it because they don't care about terrorists coming into the country? I hope that's not correct. Are they not doing it because they want gun runners to be able to come into the country and run guns? I hope that's not correct. But I tell you what: as a consequence of what you're doing, it is correct. You've left our borders open. You've left the opportunities for turnaround and for these criminal gangs to operate in a fashion appropriate for them. Case after case after case proves the weaknesses within the border security arrangements that you have. The intention of this amendment is to make sure that those weaknesses are dealt with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to ask this question of the minister: are the security arrangements adequate at Geelong port when it was said some days later to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Advertiser</span>, 'We saw in security footage that the pair had crept at pace down a gangway and set of stairs before disappearing into the night'?</span>

I will reiterate what previous ministers have said, because obviously now we're in the filibuster to end all filibusters on what is an incredibly important bill, which I understand your caucus has agreed should pass this place. We'll wait and see if that actually does occur.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As previous ministers have responded to you in relation to questions of this nature that you have continually put this morning, the Australian Border Force are working with the Victoria Police, otherwise known as VicPol. You are continuing to conflate the issues, and that's fine. You and I had this discussion yesterday in terms of the conflation of the issues. I understand you may have had a similar discussion with Senator Seselja last night. I was sitting outside for a short period of time. You had a similar discussion with Minister Reynolds this morning, as is your right.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can also advise, as Minister Reynolds has already advised, that, in relation to the questions that are being put, Australian Border Force officers conduct regular visits to any vessel of interest. Australian Border Force officers conduct regular wharf patrols and provide a high-visibility presence, maintaining a periodical or permanent Australian Border Force marked vehicle presence at the gangway. They seek continuous CCTV monitoring by the national monitoring centre of vessel gangways. If a crew member leaves a vessel in contravention of the restriction on board then local police authorities and/or port security will be contacted to effect the relevant state government health response. After that, the only thing I can add is to reiterate what Minister Reynolds has said several times today: the Australian Border Force are working with the Victoria Police, otherwise known as VicPol.</span>

There have been questions raised about security lapses, particularly in the last 24 hours but also over the last five years in a series of inquiries. The particular lapse that I'm asking you about is the Geelong port lapse. I'm asking specifically about Geelong port: is the security adequate at Geelong port?</span>

I think we are going to have to agree to disagree with the government. I just want to say, for the record—it still stands, throughout this debate—that it seems clear that the government has not taken on board the advice provided by the former Department of Immigration and Border Protection to this Senate in 2017 that flag-of-convenience vessels and foreign crew pose risks and that there are arrangements, in terms of regulation and practice, that make those vessels and those crew attractive for use in illegal activity, including by organised crime and terrorist groups. The government hasn't taken that advice, and there's nothing in this legislation that addresses that risk. It's clear the government has no intention of putting anything in place, either in this legislation or anywhere else, to address that risk. The purpose of this amendment is to try and give the government an opportunity to address that risk. They already fixed up this legislation once, when they introduced it into the parliament. They could have amended it again. They could have come up with their own scheme. They haven't done that. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear what the vote we are about to have on this amendment is. It is this Liberal-National government, Mr Morrison's government, that is refusing to put in place any measures, either in this bill or indeed where it should appropriately lie, in other legislation that deals with visas, to ensure that we are addressing the risk that was highlighted to this Senate by the then Department of Immigration and Border Protection. We have had example after example presented in this debate. There is Captain Salas, who the then Department of Immigration and Border Protection—now the Australian Border Force—have had holdings about since 1994, who's been wanted by the New South Wales coroner since 2012 for questioning, who gave evidence on the record and yet somehow was allowed to come back into Australia, to the ports of Weipa and Gladstone in 2016, despite the fact he gave evidence about his illegal and illicit activities, despite the fact he was wanted by the coroner for some years before he gave that evidence, and despite the fact the department of immigration had information about him, which they stated in evidence, since 1994. We know that the North Korean government were using flag-of-convenience vessels to smuggle weapons, including 30,000 rocket grenades. That was revealed in August 2017. We know the Tongan government was recently forced to shutter their own flag-of-convenience vessels because it was shown that al-Qaeda owned the vessels and were using the lax arrangements at maritime ports to transport weapons, ammunition and crew to Europe. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has sought a sensible solution here—to amend schedule 1 of this bill, to allow the entire regime to go ahead for aviation card holders, for the ASIC holders, and to allow schedule 2 to proceed for maritime, to allow for the intelligence assessments to proceed, to simply allow the government to have the ability to strengthen this bill, to deal with these very risks that have been highlighted now. When this vote occurs on this amendment, let's be clear what we're voting on, and, for those who vote against the amendment, let's be clear what they're saying: they're disregarding the risks posed by flag-of-convenience vessels and foreign crew.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I advise the chamber that the reason for this amendment is, despite the fact that this bill has in its definition that it is about serious crime, it actually lacks a definition of what serious crime is. Here we have a bill about transport security that's supposed to deal with serious crime, and it's not clear what serious crime is under this legislation. It's fair enough to raise this, because there are 12 different definitions of serious crime across different Commonwealth acts and regulations. While we accept that the government intends to propose a tiered scheme for this legislation, Labor's amendment proposes that minor crimes not be included in the regulations by the government. We think a bill that purports to deal with serious crime should deal with serious crime. Therefore, this amendment defines serious crime as a crime that is punishable by imprisonment for a maximum of at least three years. This is consistent with the definition of serious crime in the citizenship cessation bill currently before the parliament. Labor does believe, and we invite members of this chamber to agree, that it's reasonable to include a definition in the legislation of serious crime. We note the government have not provided a definition, and we seek to insert one. We look forward to support from the chamber for this amendment.</span>

For the clarity of the chamber, this is an amendment that seeks to expand the role of IGIS, the independent inspector, to include oversight of the ACIC. This was recommended by the 2017 intelligence review. Despite the government claiming to accept that recommendation, it's taken over three years to finally introduce legislation to implement it. But they have continued to give the ACIC new functions and new powers. Given the nature of the ACIC's work and the potential impact it can have on fundamental rights and freedoms, this amendment seeks to ensure the ACIC's intelligence related work is subject to the same degree of rigorous oversight as that of other intelligence agencies. I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 1099:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0T" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  I rise today to speak to the Online Safety Bill 2021 and the Online Safety Bill (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2021, which, as we know, seek to create a new online safety framework for Australians, an updated regulatory framework that consolidates and builds on the existing legislative scheme in our nation for online safety. In the Labor Party, we have a strong track record of supporting online safety for Australians and we support these bills. We support measures to consolidate, update and enhance online safety laws for Australians. For many years, Australians have been protected by laws to support online safety, and it is important that these laws be kept up to date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Online Safety Bill responds to the independent review of online safety laws conducted by Lynelle Briggs, which was reported to government in October of 2018. It's clear that Australia's online safety laws should be brought together in one modernised act and that industry and government should be less reactive and more responsive when it comes to online safety in our nation. So we support this principle of consolidating existing safety database online safety laws into this new framework. For example, the Online Safety Bill retains and replicates provisions in the Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015, which protects Australians from online harms such as the non-consensual sharing of intimate images, a scheme that Labor is proud to have led calls for. It also reflects a modernised online content scheme to replace schemes in schedules 5 and 7 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, in order to address harmful online content such as refused-classification material, and it updates various elements, including by setting new industry benchmarks. We support new elements of the Online Safety Bill, including the creation of a novel complaints based removal notice scheme for cyberabuse perpetrated against an adult and the articulation of a core set of basic online safety expectations to improve and promote online safety for Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, that said, we very much acknowledge that there are some significant concerns with the Online Safety Bill as drafted, and we indeed share some of these concerns. There are concerns around the process and the government's handling of the development of this bill. There was a long delay—years, in fact—in releasing the exposure draft of the legislation, only to be followed by the rushed introduction of this bill into the parliament only eight business days after consultation on the exposure draft concluded. This has significantly undermined confidence in relation to the consultation process. A number of stakeholders were concerned that submissions had not been considered properly and are unsure as to the operation of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also significant concerns as to the substance of this legislation. These are points that have been well made by stakeholders, including concerns about consultation, transparency and review mechanisms among other things. We note there are some concerns with provisions in the Online Safety Bill which are, in fact, already the law of the land here in our nation, and it's disappointing that the government was unable to foster a clear, shared understanding of the elements of this bill that consolidate existing longstanding law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in Labor have sought to have constructive good-faith negotiations in addressing concerns with the Online Safety Bill. We did not oppose these bills in the House, on the basis that the government amendments would be forthcoming. Since then, we are have engaged with the government in a constructive good-faith way in order to gain an understanding and address concerns with these bills. Overall, we report that this engagement with government has been productive. We have appreciated the attention of the minister and his staff, as well as officials of the department and the commissioner and her staff, to Labor's concerns and suggestions. Some of the concerns have been addressed with proposed government amendments to the bill, as well as the supplementary EM. We welcome these amendments and understand a further addendum to the EM will be forthcoming, which we also welcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conjunction with government amendments, some of Labor's concerns have been addressed with clarification from the government as to the operation of the bill. This has been useful. Hopefully it has served to clarify the government's understanding of the regime as well. However, some of our concerns have not been taken up and addressed by government and, therefore, we will be moving amendments in this place to strengthen transparency and review oversight of the commissioner in administering the online safety framework. In the spirit of this bipartisanship, in which online safety has historically been approached in this place, we encourage the government to support or at least not oppose these amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We acknowledge the various bill scrutiny processes that have run and note the report of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee, as well as the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, both of which made constructive suggestions. We accept the need for the commissioner to have flexibility in administering the framework. In return, however, it is important the government accept the commensurate need for greater transparency, oversight and review. There is an important balance to be found here between free speech and the protections against certain kinds of speech, and this can be complex. We are concerned that this bill represents a significant increase in the eSafety Commissioner's discretion to remove material without commensurate checks and balances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is correct to expect digital platforms to offer more in terms of transparency but, indeed, so must the government be prepared to provide transparency around decision-making, particularly on matters that engage with human rights in our country. So while supportive of a scheme for adult cyberabuse, Labor finds it curious that a government that has made repeated attempts to repeal Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act on the grounds it unduly restricts free speech, despite the availability of defences in 18D, is now seeking to pass a bill that empowers the eSafety Commissioner with discretion to determine matters of speech in relation to adult cyberbullying without greater checks or balances or operational clarity. Labor is concerned that the adult cyberabuse scheme could, in the wrong hands, be used to stifle legitimate debate and freedom of expression, given the test for adult cyberabuse is material that is menacing, harassing or offensive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I draw attention now to Dr Anne Aly's—the member for Cowan—remarks during the debate in the House. She said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Imagine a scenario where somebody is trolling with racist remarks and gets called out for it, gets called a racist, and the person, the troll, takes offence to that and reports it and instead of the racist remark being removed, the remarks that are calling out racism get removed instead … It's a very likely scenario that somebody who is trolling another individual with racist commentary and gets called out for that racist commentary can claim that they are being bullied and harassed and take action against the person who has called them out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also consider the case of John Barilaro, the New South Wales Deputy Premier, who is reported to have pursued YouTube comedian Friendlyjeordies with charges of stalking and intimidation. According to reports, detectives from New South Wales police fixated persons unit, acting on a complaint by Barilaro, arrested Kristo Langker at his family home in Dulwich Hill on 4 June and charged him with two offences. He was charged with two counts of stalking and intimidating with an intent to cause fear or physical or mental harm. Here we see that, given the provisions in the adult cyberabuse scheme go to related concepts of menace, harass or offend, it is simply not beyond the realm of contemplation to imagine a politician asserting that a journalist, a satirist or a comedian might fall foul of these provisions in the adult cyberabuse scheme, even with clause 233 on the implied freedom of political communication. So we believe there can and must be greater transparency for review and oversight to ensure that this scheme is working to get the balance of human rights and freedom of expression right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We put these concerns to the government during the Senate inquiry and during the debate in the House as part of good-faith negotiations and we welcome the government amendments that have been circulated which strengthen transparency and review, with greater detail in annual reporting as well as an internal review process. But we believe these need to go further, and that's why we are moving amendments, including for an ACMA review. We'll move an amendment to provide a pathway for independent review by ACMA where, with full discretion, ACMA may review decisions of the commissioner and report to the minister, with the report tabled in parliament. The commissioner is an officer of ACMA, and ACMA provides such a review pathway for decisions of the ABC and SBS, so this would be an important oversight mechanism. We'll move an amendment to provide greater detail in the commissioner's annual reporting to include information referrals—including to industry and end users, which account for much of the commissioner's approach—as well as categories of harm, dealt with in complaints, formal notices and informal referrals akin to the categories supplied by the Human Rights Commission in the reporting of complaints and investigations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll move amendments to formalise the advisory committee arrangements for the commissioner. Currently, the commission has an advisory committee constituted on an informal basis, with representatives from academia, industry and civil society. As with ACMA, we believe that these should be formal in law to provide multistakeholder engagement and oversight. We appreciate that the make-up of the current committee could be improved with expertise to inform matters that engage with human rights and freedom of expression, such as the Human Rights Commission, ethnic and religious groups, disability groups, consumer groups, public-interest media and communications law experts. We think there needs to be independent review of the novel adult cyberabuse scheme in and after its first year of operation, with the whole bill subject to review in three years. We will also seek to move amendments to formalise consultation requirements around restricted access systems under the Online Content Scheme, as well as consumer representation in the development of industry codes and standards.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We note concerns about the regulation of private messaging services. We canvassed the concerns with government and interrogated their operation as well as the review process for industry around these provisions. We understand that the government will clarify the operation of this provision in an addendum to the EM, and this is an important clarification. We note that the current law regulates private messaging services and that a significant proportion of cyberbullying occurs in these services. On balance, given the flexibility that platforms have in warning end users or suspending accounts of end users who fail to accord with the platform's terms of use, and given the clarification from government around the intended operation of this element, we're satisfied that there are appropriate checks and balances on this power. I will go into these amendments in more detail during the committee stage.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="JKM" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  The bills before us today, the Online Safety Bill 2021 and the Online Safety (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2021, establish a framework to regulate harmful online content in Australia. This is an extremely important issue that the Australian Greens acknowledge needs to be addressed. But it should be addressed carefully and in a considered fashion, and our submission is that the government is not addressing it in a careful enough way or in a considered enough fashion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to be clear that the Australian Greens do support the establishment of a framework that provides for the quick take-down of inappropriate online content in Australia. I also want to be clear that the Australian Greens condemn the online bullying and the online abuse of Australians, including child abuse and the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. These are important issues. It is necessary that we reform the law in these areas but it is equally necessary that we get it right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I speak about the details of the bills themselves, I want to speak about the process the bills have gone through to get to where they are today. Unfortunately, I have to say that the government is ramming these bills through this parliament without adequate consideration and adequate scrutiny. For example, the government flagged its intention to table the bills before consultation on the exposure draft had closed. The bills were then introduced into the House with just a few technical amendments to the exposure draft before the around 400 submissions to the exposure draft were made public. The bills were referred to the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee the next day, to report just two short weeks later. Then the government sought to have the bills listed as non-contro so that they could be quickly and quietly waved through the Senate. Then the government moved to exempt the bills from the usual requirements that regulate how quickly bills can be brought on for debate in the Senate. As an example of the indecent haste with which the government has operated, these bills were so rushed that the government is needing to use amendments to fix typos in the original bill. These bills, which are intended to protect people from cyberbullies, from cyberabuse, from the non-consensual sharing of intimate images and from violent and extremist materials—commendable objectives—are being rushed through this place. We want the parliament to get these bills right, and we believe we represent in that case most Australians, who want this parliament to get these bills right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens do not support the bills in the current form in which they are presented to the Senate. We are aware of the amendments that have been circulated by the government that, if passed, would address some of the concerns the Greens have raised in regard to this legislation. We still have concerns about the huge regulatory and discretionary powers these bills confer on the eSafety Commissioner, a single person who is not elected by the Australian people to that position. We are concerned about the lack of oversight, in some cases, of the eSafety Commissioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills, I think everyone would agree, provide significant powers to the eSafety Commissioner, but, as drafted, provide for limited appeals against decisions of the commissioner. No internal review process was established in the bills as originally drafted and presented, and the risk there was that people or businesses who were acting lawfully and were adversely affected by decisions of the commissioner could have been left with no business or no income while potentially costly appeals slowly worked their way through the AAT and, ultimately, the court system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, we acknowledge that the government has cobbled together an amendment to provide for an internal review process, but we note that this amendment doesn't actually create, of itself, an internal review process. What it does is require the commissioner to create such a process. So, in a way, the parliament is being asked to sign a blank cheque in regard to the creation of that process, because we have no possibility of knowing what kind of process the eSafety Commissioner will establish as we stand here and debate this bill today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem for the government, of course, is that, because of its self-imposed deadlines and the fact that those were so short, it hasn't actually had the time to come up with such a review mechanism to include the provisions of that mechanism in this legislation. Effectively, it has handballed it off into the never-never. As well as lacking a quick and practical review and appeal process with appropriate remedies, the bills, as tabled, also lack robust transparency reporting. Again, the Greens acknowledge that this has been addressed to some extent by the government's amendments. As I said, there's the use of amendments to correct typos in the original legislation—and, for folks playing along at home, the amendment that the government has tabled changes 'cyber-bulling' to 'cyber-bullying'. Of course that needs to be fixed up, but the fact that we needed an amendment to fix up a typo is symptomatic of the rush to legislate in an extremely important but also extremely complex policy area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills test the intention of a person posting online material by inquiring whether an ordinary, reasonable person would think it likely that the material was intended to cause harm. But this test considers no evidence other than the material itself. This is potentially problematic, because the context around violent imagery and content is crucial to understanding the purpose of disseminating that content and the level of any harm caused.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens also have significant concerns about the bills' powers being used, despite some limited protections, to block and take down public-interest news or campaigns that involve violent imagery—for example, campaigns against police brutality. The eSafety Commissioner has made public comment with regard to some of these issues, and we acknowledge those comments and thank her for them. But the person who is currently the eSafety Commissioner will not be the eSafety Commissioner forever, and it should be incumbent on parliaments to make sure that we legislate not just with one particular person in one particular position in mind but with a clear-eyed focus on the need to make sure that protections will exist past the incumbency of any one person in any particular position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this legislation, the commissioner will be guided by the National Classification Code. That code is currently being reviewed and it doesn't provide appropriate classifications for online media. Therefore, in the view of the Greens, it is not fit for the purposes of this legislation. Classifications based on the code may capture non-violent sexual activity, including nudity and implied or simulated sexual activity, as well as materials considered unsuitable for a minor to see. The concern that the Greens have in this area is that the bills fail to differentiate between actual harm and subjective, moralistic constructions of harm. This would allow the commissioner to act as a moral censor and the commissioner's powers to be weaponised by people and organisations with moral or political agendas. Again I acknowledge comments made by the commissioner with regard to these issues, and again I point out that the person who is currently the eSafety Commissioner will not be the eSafety Commissioner forever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills will also, inevitably, lead to online platforms resorting to automated processes based on algorithms and artificial intelligence to identify and remove content that could attract penalties. The use of AI and algorithms in similar circumstances in places like the US has been extremely controversial, to say the least, and we are concerned that the use of those technologies could lead to disproportionate outcomes, like blanket bans, even if that is not the intent of the commissioner. The use of algorithms and AI will also risk importing racial bias into the regulation of Australia's online content ecosystem. We know that that is a risk because that is exactly what has happened in the US under similar controversial laws, such as the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, the FOSTA, and the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, the SESTA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While a complaint based framework for the non-consensual sharing of intimate images is very important and absolutely supported in principle by the Australian Greens, we want to make sure, again, that this complex area is legislated with full care and full consideration. The definition of an intimate image provided by these bills does not clearly state whether it applies at the moment an image is taken, which could have serious implications for the utility of the scheme for transgender folk in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of particular concern to the Greens and many submitters to the Senate inquiry is the potentially devastating effect the bills will have on sex workers and adult content creators operating lawful businesses that provide lawful products and services, many of whom have migrated online as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are worried about the potential for this framework to be used to drive people from the internet back into the streets or ultimately into insolvency. We are concerned about the unintended consequences that could be harmful to sex workers and adult businesses and to the broader community. Under the bills, as argued by Scarlet Alliance, sex workers will become more vulnerable as they potentially lose access to income, safety tools and strategies and vital peer connections. We are also concerned that the bills fail to promote the maximum safety and privacy protections that they could.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say again: the Greens absolutely commend the stated objectives of these bills, to keep women, children and the broader Australian community safe in online environments. We absolutely support women's and children's rights, and we have staunchly opposed extremism and radicalisation, particularly right-wing extremism and radicalisation. But we need to make sure that we don't protect one set of rights by trampling over other rights. Bills this significant, targeted at problems this complex, should receive full and proper scrutiny in this place. That is what the government, unfortunately, is seeking to deny. That is why the Greens will be moving a second reading amendment, calling for the bills to be withdrawn and redrafted to take account of the many and significant concerns raised by submitters. I foreshadow that I will move the second reading amendment standing in my name:</span>

This chamber should have taken the time to make sure that we get it right and that we avoid, to the greatest extent possible, any unintended consequences flowing from this legislation. The Australian Greens are disappointed that this chamber has not been given that opportunity.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:44</span>):  In rising to make some comments about the Online Safety Bill 2021 I think it is important to note that the trend in this area of regulation and big tech, as it's widely become known, is only going to increase. Big tech has changed our lives for the better and it has also brought new risks which need to be managed by policymakers. That is what this bill is an attempt to do. It is an attempt to intervene into the market and into the way that these schemes operate to protect people. That is an important starting point because the philosophy that you bring to these debates is important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our view has always been that it is important to inject policy and regulation wherever there is consumer detriment. This is not a capital and labour thing; this is a consumer protection thing. The government has built up a decent record here of being prepared to intervene where there is consumer detriment or where there is broader community detriment in relation to technology companies. It's been widely said that tech companies are the railroads or oil companies of the 21st century. These companies have so much power. They have done much good, but they have the potential to do much bad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last few months we've seen world-leading media bargaining code legislation. We have led the world in trying to ensure that publishers and public interest journalists are paid for their work. We have also been prepared to intervene to ensure that consumers are protected. Social media really is the wild west. I am not in favour of regulation for regulation's sake, but there is so much content on social media which already contravenes our laws—many of them state laws, I should say. But I don't think we should be reluctant about moving into this territory of ensuring that big tech organisations have an appropriate level of regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The conduct of the engagement of the big tech organisations during the media bargaining code legislation debate was probably the worst lobbying I have ever seen in my life. People would be aware that large companies threatened to leave Australia and threatened to do all sorts of things. I think once you have a global company threatening a democracy, threatening a country, the country has to win, because we can't get into a situation where companies are so large that they are effectively able to boss a democracy around. We have been here before. People can go back and look at what Theodore Roosevelt said about all these things. We borrowed much of the antitrust principles in Australia as well through our own competition law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is a very welcome initiative. What it really does is bring to bear a simple, single framework for online safety. I think setting out the basic online safety expectations and arming the eSafety Commissioner with the power to effectively ensure that people are protected will be broadly welcomed. The concerns that I have here would be widely shared across this parliament—that there is bullying and abuse that goes on online. It is rampant at times. It is leading to people doing all sorts of dreadful things. I think that the commitments we made back in the election campaign to increase penalties for the use of a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence from three to five years is really important. I think it's one of the most important commitments that we took to the last election. People are being bullied. People are being abused. Often it occurs under the cover of anonymity. There's nowhere else in our world, in our society, where you can, under the cover of darkness, pretend to be someone else and basically attack people—you can use all manner of things to attack people, and to try to destroy their lives—and it's just not good enough. You can't do it in broad daylight. You can't do it in any other theatre in life. The policy here, to effectively reign in carriage services, is a very important one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I won't bore you with the talking points, but the point really is that this will be a clear framework. It is important that we respect the system of parliamentary oversight, and it is very welcome that the basic online safety expectations will be set by the minister and be disallowable by either chamber of the parliament. In this place, in this debate, just as you see in any other similar debate, we don't want to pass down to regulators rule-making capacity. These are important rules. We're balancing civil liberties against the desire to protect people, and these are judgements that should be exercised by a minister and they should be disallowable, and that is the intention. The eSafety Commissioner will do a great job here—I have a lot of confidence in the incumbent—but the framework of having the minister setting the regulation is an important one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, we want to have a system where Australia is not a backwater. And while we want to see technology used—technology is good—we also want to make sure people are protected. What we don't want to see is people being bullied and harassed online. We don't want to see people attacking people under the cover of anonymity, because they're too gutless to say who they really are. That's not the sort of debate we want to have. That's not the sort of country we want to have. I, personally, want to see that sort of behaviour reigned in. Social media is the Wild West. Anything goes, and it is not good enough for people to use social media platforms to break the laws of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have laws in New South Wales against anti-incitement and defamation, and social media should not provide a back door to breaking the law. It's very important that this scheme is ultimately going to protect people from cyberbullying, from image abuse, and is done in a way which balances out the privacy concerns that are going to be legitimately held and that the rules are made by the minister in that way. This is a very important piece of legislation. It is utterly consistent with our Liberal philosophy to intervene where it's in the public interest, and it builds on the media bargaining code, which was a very important win for Australia. It was so important that we prevailed once the big tech companies started to threaten our country. We cannot have a situation where large tech companies, which have more power than almost any other non-state actor in the world today, can bully and defeat a country. Australia has led the world again. This is a very important bill, and I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:53</span>):  I rise to speak on the Online Safety Bill 2021 and the Online Safety (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2021. These bills are important if we're able to tackle the sharing of illegal images and to address head-on the prevalence of revenge porn within our communities. Governments are almost always starting from behind when we're talking about technology. Technology advances travel so quickly, and governments are trying to catch their breath and keep ahead of the curve. Ideally, these bills continue to build on existing legislation schemes for online safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor welcomes funding to support online safety, with a particular focus on women and children. However, it is disappointing that this government cites the introduction of the Online Safety Bill 2021 that is now before parliament as evidence of its commitment to women's safety while it also permits the member for Bowman, Andrew Laming MP, to remain as a member of the LNP. He sits in the Liberal Party room, he sits on the government benches and he remains the chair of a parliamentary committee with the support of the Liberal and National parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As stated in a number of media reports recently, Mr Laming has a long history of trolling and abusing his own constituents on Facebook, which has undermined the safety and mental health of at least one woman. Mr Laming's conduct online is precisely what the proposed new adult cyberabuse scheme contained in this bill is designed to address—menacing, harassing or offensive material online. I think it's important that this is on the record and that those opposite are silent as to the actions of Mr Laming.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently read an article about a study by anthropologists about the use of smartphones and technology and how our phones are changing the human experience at a personal level and a group level. The anthropologists argue that our devices have become an extension of ourselves. Smartphones are now a transportable home. We use them to organise our schedules, find entertainment and communicate with family and friends. They are where we anchor our sense of identity and self. 'We have become human snails carrying our homes in our pockets,' they write, and: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The smartphone is perhaps the first object to challenge the house itself (and possibly also the workplace) in terms of the amount of time we dwell in it while awake …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's an interesting argument. Smartphones have become such a pervasive part of our lives. And let's be honest: who can compete with a smartphone? The interactive capabilities of a smartphone on an intellectual level are superior to any human, in terms of the sheer amount and variety of information that is accessible from this device. The article goes on to argue that there needs to be a new etiquette to manage the digital age, because balancing a physical reality with a digital life causes frustration, disappointment or even offence, for those left staring at someone sitting hunched over their device.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, while there is a prevalence of young Australians doing so, Australians of all ages are using their smartphones to transmit inappropriate images—images that can ruin people's lives. The Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015 operates to protect Australians from online harms such as non-consensual sharing of intimate images, but laws must also improve and ensure that the eSafety Commissioner has the ability to ensure that images are removed as quickly as possible—an advancement that all should applaud.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports measures to consolidate, update and enhance online safety laws for Australians. Online safety is an area of bipartisanship, and Labor is looking for bipartisanship regarding this policy area. It is too important not to get it right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some concerns around due process, appeals, oversight and transparency requirements in relation to the novel adult cyberabuse scheme, given the important free-speech implications, and as to whether the powers given to the eSafety Commissioner could subvert the framework of safeguards put in place under the telecommunications assistance and access regime, including its warrant processes and the prohibitions it includes on actions that would introduce systemic weaknesses in the communications scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor notes that it has been almost 2½ years since the Briggs review of October 2018 recommended a single, up-to-date online safety act. Given the significant passage of time, it is disappointing that the Morrison government has proved incapable of conducting a process that satisfies stakeholders in terms of process and substance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has been spruiking this new online safety act for almost two years. In the lead-up to the May 2019 federal election, the Morrison government promised to introduce a new online safety act. In September 2019, the minister for communications spruiked the new online safety act in answer to questions about what the government was doing to keep Australians safe online, including in relation to the rise of right-wing extremists, online hate speech and racism in Australia following the Christchurch terrorist atrocity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A year later, in September 2020, the minister again spruiked the non-existent online safety act in response to questions about what the government was doing to curb graphic content on social media platforms in the wake of a self-harm video on Facebook and TikTok. The minister's October 2020 op-ed kept the promise of a new online safety act alive, while his department at Senate estimates put the delay down to 'pressures on drafting resources'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of stakeholders are concerned that the Morrison government introduced the bill into parliament on 24 February 2021, only eight days after consultation on the exposure draft of legislation concluded on 14 February 2021. The short time frame at the end of this drawn-out process has undermined confidence in the government's exposure draft consultation process, with a number of stakeholders concerned that submissions have not been considered properly. At the time the bill was referred to this inquiry on 25 February 2021, Labor senators had no visibility of either the number of submissions that had been made on the exposure draft or the range or nature of concerns raised in those submissions. In evidence to the inquiry, the department confirmed that 376 submissions on the exposure draft were received, uploaded and made available publicly only the day prior to the inquiry hearings. The department further advised that it had assessed the submissions and identified 56 issues that warranted further consideration by the minister, and that seven amendments of a technical nature were made to the bill as a result of that consideration. We note that the review of Australia's classification regulations—for which public consultation closed over a year ago, on 19 February 2020—is delayed and has fallen out of step with this reform process as a result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the major issue of free speech, Labor understands that the balance between free speech and protection against certain kinds of speech is a complex endeavour. We are concerned that this bill represents a significant increase in the eSafety Commissioner's discretion to remove material, without commensurate requirements for due process, appeals or transparency over and above Senate estimates annual reporting and AAT appeals. While supportive of a scheme relating to adult cyberabuse, we on this side find it curious that a government that has made repeated attempts to repeal section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act on the grounds that it unduly restricts free speech, despite the availability of defences in section 18D, is now seeking to rush through a bill that empowers the eSafety Commissioner with discretion to determine matters of speech in relation to adult cyberbullying without greater checks and balances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government talks a big game about its expectations of social media platforms, yet, to date, it has failed to do its job by updating Australia's online safety laws. While the government is right to expect digital platforms to offer more in terms of transparency, so too must the government be prepared to provide transparency around decision-making, particularly on matters that engage with human rights. For this reason, we on this side recommended that the government consider further amendments to clarify the bill in terms of its scope and to strengthen due process, appeals, oversights and transparency requirements, given the important free-speech and digital-rights considerations it engages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would encourage those opposite to stop slouching over their smartphones and have a good, intent, face-to-face conversation with those in this chamber, so that we can protect more Australians from the misuse of smartphones. If they do that, we can make this a truly bipartisan improvement to the lives of all Australians, to ensure technology enriches our lives instead of determining our lives. We have all read on social media or heard through other forms of media about the devastating effect that these faceless people have and the anonymity that they use to bully, harass and embarrass people through social media. As with all new interventions—and we know, as I said, how quickly technology moves—we have to always ensure that people are protected from bullies, from people who want to try and intimidate them, from people who want to embarrass them, and from people who want to use this technology for illegal activities and for abusing people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge people in this chamber, and in particular the government, to support our amendment. I therefore support the bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:05</span>):  I rise to speak on the Online Safety Bill 2021 and the Online Safety (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2021. The Australian Greens agree that online safety is a significant issue and an important concern for Australian internet users. You don't have to be a parent to share concerns about children having access to graphic online content, the prevalence of sharing of intimate photos, exposure to cyberbullying—all without the respectful relationships and consent education that children need to navigate it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also keenly aware of the misogynistic abuse that people experience online. As the Greens spokesperson for women, I understand the national crisis of violence against women and their children and the growing scourge of online and technology facilitated abuse. I hear story after story of coercive and violent ex-partners continuing their abuse online: sending violent images, sharing intimate images without consent, bombarding social media with threatening messages and harassing their victims via email. Any abuse of women and children is completely unacceptable. The reported trebling of cyberabuse and image based abuse during COVID is a salutary warning that abusers will use all tools at their disposal to perpetuate their control over others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens believe that we must protect vulnerable internet users and stamp out abuse and violence, online and offline. I also acknowledge the work being done by the eSafety Commissioner on these issues and the recognition in the budget of the need to tackle the rise in technology facilitated abuse. However, this bill, as it is currently drafted, is not the right solution to this very real problem. This bill has been rushed, and it gives far too much unfettered discretion to the unelected eSafety Commissioner. The bill as it stands has largely ignored the concerns raised in the over 350 submissions received in response to rushed consultation that happened over the Christmas break. Many of those submissions highlight that what is proposed goes beyond what is needed to address core concerns, while still failing to adequately address the more insidious forms of online and technology facilitated abuse that are emerging. It represents a missed opportunity to find a path through this complex area that will achieve appropriate protections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, the submission from the Women's Services Network, also known as WESNET, notes that the bill will go some way towards improving online safety:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… but in our view underestimates the ways in which perpetrators of domestic and family violence can misuse technology to harm and abuse their victims using online mechanisms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">WESNET is concerned that the Online Safety Bill may be presented as an institution to technology-facilitated abuse by surveyors of domestic and domestic violence. In reality, the misuse of technology is far broader than the coverage of this bill. The dynamics of domestic and family violence are often also more complex and multi-faceted and require a much larger and coordinated response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments that my colleague Senator McKim will move aim to correct that balance, preserving the parts of the bill that provide additional protections for vulnerable internet users, strengthening the protection for digital rights, and removing the provisions likely to be weaponised against women and undermine the overall objectives of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Submissions from WESNET and Domestic Violence Victoria raise concerns that the bill as drafted will be easily circumvented by perpetrators and could be used against survivors by making false complaints, coercing children to make unsubstantiated complaints, reporting dating profile information from a former partner or by impersonating the survivor online. This is not the stuff of fantasy. The eSafety Commissioner has reported that, in more than a quarter of family violence cases, perpetrators pretend to be the adult victim-survivor online. The bill introduces wide powers for the eSafety Commissioner but does not balance these with adequate rights of appeal or ways to prevent vexatious abuse of the complaints process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">WESNET and DV Victoria also caution that 'ordinary person' and 'serious harm' tests set up in the bill fail to recognise the unseen harm done by perpetrators who are controlling and are skilled at using victims-survivors' personal experiences and fears against them. In a recent national survey undertaken by WESNET and Curtin University, many frontline experts working with victims-survivors observed that threats are often covert. They're targeted and they're harmful and they have meaning for the victim that doesn't seem abusive to another person. What might seem to an outsider like a benign message can in fact be a targeted threat. A request to pack the kids' Medicare card for their weekend with their dad 'in case they get hurt' might be seen as a responsible reminder if you ignore the family violence context in which this is a coded threat to harm the children. It is these complexities that are not adequately addressed by the current bill as it's currently drafted. This bill may be an attempt to improve online safety for victims-survivors of abuse, but, without amendment and redrafting, it does not create the measures needed to stamp out this abuse, and it has harmful unintended consequences on digital rights and online work.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HENDERSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:11</span>):  It's my great pleasure to rise and speak on the Online Safety Bill 2021 and the Online Safety Bill (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2021. As of this year there are 22.82 million internet users in Australia, which is 89 per cent of the population. More than 20 million of those people are active social media users. On average, Australians spend six hours and 13 minutes per day on the internet. That's almost 40 per cent of their waking hours. A full third of that time is spent on social media. The online world is an incredible place. It is an ineradicable part of the everyday lives of millions of Australians. It is a world where we can find everything from obscure mathematical theorems to the latest in fashion. It is a world in which we can engage in conversations with others thousands of kilometres away in forgotten parts of the world in forgotten cities. It is a world of over 30 trillion unique webpages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In such a dizzying labyrinth of texts, images and videos, it is easy to be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information and opinion thrown at us every time we enter it. For an increasing number of Australians, the experience is harrowing and destructive. Over 20 per cent of young people experience abuse online, and the statistics for the population more generally are no better. Let me just say that again: over 20 per cent of all young people going online experience some form of abuse. Alarmingly, some 87 per cent of young people have witnessed cyberbullying online. Again I say that number: 87 per cent. Unlike abuse on the street, cyberabuse and harassment can happen at any time and be broadcast to thousands, if not millions, of strangers. Cyberbullying also shows human beings at their most petty and their most shallow and, at times, their most destructive. Seventy-two per cent of victims of cyberbullying are targeted because of the way they look. Given these statistics, it has never been more important to ensure that Australians stay safe online. We should enjoy the same standards online as we do in the town square, and the online safety bill guarantees exactly that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note with some concern the criticism of other senators opposite, from the Greens and the Labor Party. While they are supporting this bill, I note their criticisms. But I say very strongly today that I'm incredibly proud that the Morrison government is the government fixing this issue. We did not see this sort of action from Labor when it was in power. We did not see the Labor Party combating these issues. Along with all the other work we've done to protect the safety of women, in particular, and children and to combat domestic violence, these bills are a very important part of the suite of measures that our government has taken to protect people in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills establish a set of basic online safety expectations for industry, and include mandatory transparent reporting requirements which allow the eSafety Commissioner to require online services to provide specific information about online harms. These include responses to material depicting abhorrent, violent conduct and volumetric attacks in which organised digital lynch mobs can overwhelm a victim with abuse. The bills also include a strengthened cyberbullying scheme for Australian children, building on the government's existing scheme for protecting children online. The bills set out a new cyberabuse scheme to remove serious forms of online abuse from the internet and, very importantly, this is backed up by strong civil penalties. Similarly, internet content hosts face new requirements to take down image based abuse within 24 hours, on pain of penalty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The eSafety Commissioner's powers—and let me say that the eSafety Commissioner is doing an extraordinary job in our community in protecting people, particularly children, online—have been expanded. The commissioner can now use a rapid website-blocking power to block material depicting abhorrent, violent conduct during an online crisis, such as what occurred during the Christchurch massacre when, disgracefully and disgustingly, Facebook failed to remove that abhorrent content in any reasonable time frame. The commissioner's information-gathering powers have also been expanded so that the commissioner can unmask the identities of anonymous online accounts being used to bully, abuse and humiliate innocent people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Statistics tell one kind of story, but it is a remote and abstract one. The concrete reality is that most of us know someone who has been affected by online cyberbullying, cyberabuse or humiliation. This is an issue particularly close to my heart as well, and I have stood in this chamber previously and spoken about the trolling to which I have been subjected by my political opponents. In my particular experience, which happened over a period of some four years, I was subjected to shocking abuse, humiliation and false claims by people running a number of anonymous Twitter accounts. They made some really distressing claims, including attaching my face—my head shot—to the photo of a woman who has the name Sarah Henderson. She is a woman from Texas who had been charged and has now been convicted of killing her two children. I can say that my local political opponents on these anonymous Twitter accounts thought it was okay to compare me with a woman by the same name who had killed her two children. How revolting and disgusting is that?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased that Geelong police took this on. They investigated this conduct and sought a warrant from Twitter. Equally disgustingly, Twitter refused to comply with that warrant to provide Geelong police with any information about the cowardly people behind those anonymous accounts. I will not give up on this issue; I will not give up on continuing to hold the people behind these anonymous Twitter accounts to account for what they thought was okay to do. As I say, it was absolutely disgraceful that Twitter refused to comply with a police warrant, despite the head of government relations telling me that Twitter would have no issue in doing so once they had a police warrant or a court order.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I am very, very pleased with the government's work in relation to these bills. We must do everything we can to arrest this abhorrent and corrosive phenomenon. I am a very, very proud supporter of this legislation. It is necessary. It is effective. It provides immediate response powers. It holds many people to account for their conduct online, and it obviously supports the government's determination to protect Australians from the tsunami of horrific material which can occur online. I commend these bills to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="259819" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Online Safety Bill 2021 and the transitional provisions that go with it. I was one of the members of the Senate committee that performed an inquiry into this bill and I have taken a keen interest in the development of this legislation. The bill will establish a complaints system for cyberbullying material targeted at Australian children, the non-consensual sharing of intimate images and cyberabuse material targeted at Australian adults, and it will establish the Online Content Scheme. It will also provide for the minister to determine basic online safety expectations for social media services, relevant electronic services and designated internet services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also creates a new complaints based system which allows for a removal notice scheme for cyberabuse targeted at an adult. It creates a specific and targeted power for the eSafety Commission to request or require an internet service provider to block access to materials that promote, incite, instruct in or depict abhorrent, violent conduct. These notices would be for time limited periods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor strongly support the objective of this bill. We can't be clearer than that. But we do have genuine concerns about how long it took for this bill to be drafted after the minister was out there championing this bill for so long without it actually being drafted or introduced into this parliament. The consultation period, as we've heard, was lacking. The fact that the government didn't take into account many of the recommendations from the department or stakeholders continues to be a concern. Many stakeholders have raised multiple concerns about this bill, including: the functions and the powers of the oversight of the eSafety Commissioner, who is an unelected official; the clarity and breadth of the basic online safety expectations; the services in the scope of the online content regulation schemes; the clarity and proportionality of the blocking scheme; and the appropriateness of the Online Content Scheme. There have also been concerns about the response time required to remove notices if there is an objection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The safety of Australians online is of paramount importance. I don't think any senator in this chamber would disagree with that. For many years Australians have been protected by laws to support online safety, and it is crucial that these laws are kept up to date and improved to keep up with technological changes. Labor support the consolidation of online safety laws into a new framework and we also support the new elements of the bill, which are the elements that attracted so much attention through the inquiry phase.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We live in an era that is increasingly spent online, which demands measures to mitigate online harm be kept up to date. Fundamentally, I understand the importance of the need to balance the right protecting against harmful speech and the right protecting free speech. That's not always a black-and-white thing for legislators to do. So I want to thank all of the people who contributed to the Senate inquiry and the senators who came along to that inquiry and asked a lot of detailed questions of the commissioner and of stakeholders about how this bill would impact on people, how it would impact on free speech and how it would be delivered. As senators, we seek to protect Australians from any harm, but we must also be aware of the impact that these provisions could have on freedom of expression. That is why you will see senators around the chamber today raising these questions in good faith whilst also supporting the objectives of this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the issues raised with me during the Senate inquiry into this bill was the lack of transparency around the use of unprecedented powers by the commissioner. I understand that the government has now circulated, or will be circulating, amendments requiring the commissioner to report in their annual report the frequency of the use of these powers. This is a real win for the Senate inquiry process and for the submitters that contributed to the Senate inquiry, because that was a gaping hole in this legislation in relation to transparency and accountability to this parliament. Labor supports a holistic, multifaceted, layered approach, including safety by design, adult supervision, technological measures and education of both adults and children. While Labor will be supporting this bill, we're certainly not happy with how it has been delivered. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we acknowledge the concerns raised by stakeholders. As usual, the government has been big on announcement and slow on delivery. You won't be surprised to hear that it was almost 2½ years ago that the Briggs review recommended a single up-to-date online safety act, and here we are. The government was spruiking an online safety act the entire time, but we're only now getting to the point where we're able to debate this legislation in the parliament. In the lead-up to the May 2019 federal election, the Morrison government promised to introduce a bill, but we've had to wait two years before they could achieve that. It's interesting because, in an extraordinary move, the minister was actually taking credit for the act without having actually passed it through parliament first. In 2019, when faced with the rise of right-wing extremism, online hate speech and racism in Australia, an online safety act was the answer, but it hadn't actually been passed through parliament yet. The minister also used the bill in response to questions about what the government was going to do to curb graphic online social media content. In October 2020, when the minister published an op-ed about the new online safety act, the department was in budget estimates, admitting further delays to the bill because of pressures on drafting resources. So, while the government are congratulating themselves today, it has taken a long time to get here—too long, Labor would say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the consultation period, the department confirmed that there were 376 submissions on the exposure draft, but there were 56 issues with the bill identified by the department itself. Only seven amendments, of a technical nature, were made as a result. I note that one of those amendments presented to this chamber is actually to correct a spelling mistake in the word 'bullying'. When asked about the key operational aspects of the bill, the eSafety Commissioner called it 'a sausage still being made'. There's still a lot we don't know about how this bill will be implemented. Some 2½ years later, the government has proved incapable of conducting a process that satisfies stakeholders in terms of both process and substance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is even more disappointing is how the government cannot seem to hold its own party room to the same standards set out by the legislation we are voting on today. Those opposite have pointed out the government's so-called commitment to women's safety online. Even the minister himself was quoted as saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Morrison Government wants Australians to engage online confidently—to work, communicate and be entertained, without fear of being viciously trolled or exposed to harmful content…</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, when it comes to turning those words into action, to taking real action, well, the government is completely silent. Just recently, in my home state of Queensland, the very proud member for Redlands, Kim Richards, stood in the state parliament and tabled evidence of harassment of her and other women online by the government's very own member for Bowman, Mr Laming. She called on the LNP to do the right thing with regard to Mr Laming—to turn their words into action. Mr Laming has a long and proven track record of trolling and abusing his constituents online—</span>

Mr Laming has made social media posts inciting stalking behaviour, offering cash prizes to get the member for Redlands to answer questions and in one instance actually followed the member for Redlands into a public park and took pictures of her. On Valentine's Day, Mr Laming incited more stalking behaviour via a Facebook post, once again offering a cash prize for details on the location of the member for Redlands, a female politician, and the people in her company. The member for Redlands even sought advice—this is what Kim Richards, the member for Redlands, was forced to do because of Mr Laming's behaviour—about the invasive and personal behaviour of Mr Laming and, as a result, had to install CCTV cameras and an electronic security gate. She was also advised, because of the detriment that she was receiving, because of the behaviour of Mr Laming, that she should speak with a psychologist.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Laming's inappropriate online content is exactly what the government's cyberabuse scheme is aiming to stamp out. In fact, I put this question to the department in estimates. The department secretary told me that the scheme would provide a pathway for people to make complaints about exactly this kind of behaviour, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it is fair to say that absolutely the intention behind this new bill, when it's passed, is to provide an avenue for people experiencing that kind of activity—to have a pathway to make complaints and have someone able to take some action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have this curious situation where the government are here talking about how important online safety is and particularly how important it is for women's safety online for this bill to be passed, yet they will not take any action against Mr Laming, despite the evidence, despite the public comments by Mr Laming himself that he is a Facebook troll. The hypocrisy of this government on the one hand championing this bill but also, on the other hand, championing Mr Laming is absolutely galling. It should not be happening and the government know it. But they're too afraid to step up and do something to make sure that Mr Laming isn't able to harass any more women online. He continues to be a committee chair. He continues to get the support of the government members in the House of Representatives. Every single day when something is put to them, where they have the choice to support Mr Laming or to support a motion calling out his behaviour, they want to support Mr Laming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you that there are many more women like Kim Richards. I am very proud of the member for Redlands for stepping up and talking about this in the Queensland parliament. I will talk about this every single time the government seek to talk about online safety, because, until they take action against Mr Laming—until they see that the behaviour that he has contributed to Kim Richards, the member for Redlands, a female politician, who deserves so much better from this government—then all of the things that they say about this bill and about this issue are completely hollow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports this bill and its various elements designed to strengthen protections for Australians online. However, the bills have been delayed, and here we are again talking about how this government can believe that such important bills for Australian women should be passed today when they haven't taken action against the member for Bowman. He's still on the government backbench. He's still a chair of a parliamentary committee. He's still earning an extra $20,000 a year for that role. Senators opposite should hang their heads in shame, because they have failed to step up and do the right thing. The standard that you walk past is the standard that you accept, and you are telling the many women in Redlands who have suffered online abuse from this member that you accept that abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor support these bills, but we do not support the behaviour of Mr Laming and we in this place are not afraid to say so. I also want to foreshadow that, because of this very curious hypocrisy, I will be moving a second reading amendment to the bills requiring the government to lead by example when it comes to keeping women safe online and to ensure that the member for Bowman is discharged from the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training immediately.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:36</span>):  The Greens oppose the legislation, the Online Safety Bill 2021 and the Online Safety (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2021, as it has been put before the Senate today, and I would like to outline for the Senate and for those following at home exactly why. In doing so, I would first like to thank my colleague Senator McKim, for his outstanding and detailed work on this legislation, and also his office, led by Andrew Perry in the policy area. I would also like to thank Noelle Martin of Western Australia, who has, for a very long time, been a great source of information and advice to me in relation to these often complex and deeply important issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's start from a place where I think everybody should be able to agree—that every person should be able to live their lives free of violence, exploitation, abuse and neglect. When we are talking about the need to safeguard this right and this expectation in relation to abuse that somebody might experience in the digital space, we often talk about a broad terminology called cyberbullying, or online abuse. What is often lost in that terminology is some of the deep complexities and different forms that abuse takes when an online environment is also involved. I'm somebody who has been aware of these issues in a personal capacity, and I have experienced some of them myself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a newly-elected senator, one of the first inquiries I was part of explored some of these very complicated issues. I think it's useful to break them down broadly into three categories. We have the non-consensual sharing of intimate images, then we have what we might call bullying that takes place in a cyberrealm as well as in personal interaction between individuals, and then, finally, we have online facilitated abuse. These are very distinct forms of abuse that have distinct characteristics, all of which require, funnily enough, a bespoke policy response from legislators at both the state and federal level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The non-consensual sharing of intimate images is a disgusting and disgraceful phenomenon in our society today. Its roots are deeply set in the disrespectful and dehumanising ways in which women, people of colour and people who are queer are treated, and what standards of behaviour are accepted and expected. To deal with those issues, we need policy responses that deal with both the outcome and the root cause.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to cyberbullying, it is often denoted by different social contexts and relationships between those that are the subject of the form of abuse or bullying and those that are the perpetrators. It was put very clearly to me during one of these inquiry processes that what is critical to understand when analysing cyberbullying that it is the social phenomenon of bullying moving into a digital realm. Those who are victims and perpetrators of it often know each other, and there's a high likelihood that the victim of a cyberbullying incident may well also be the perpetrator of a subsequent incident and vice versa. Often, cyberbullying takes place in a close-knit social environment, like a school, and will involve somebody below the age of 18. So, again, the policy response required is specific, bespoke and balancing the reality that we may well be legislating in an area where people below the age of 18 are involved and where there's a need, ultimately, to solve these problems both at the end and at the root cause—often by involving an entire school, entire community approach to solve that problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And all the while we must recognise that the vast majority of kids and children at school do not engage in cyberbullying behaviour. The best estimate is that around 40 per cent of kids experience or perpetrate these types of abuses. While that's a large percentage, we shouldn't build a picture of an entire generation behaving in this way. And we should also ground it in the reality that before there was a digital space for this to occur it just happened interpersonally. It's been a factor in school life and adolescence for a very long time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third and final category, online facilitated abuse, is denoted and often marked out by the absence of a relationship between the perpetrator and the victim—the perpetrator is not known to the victim and vice versa. The victim is selected at random and is often part of a broader cohort which the perpetrator is targeting, and they're often above the age of 18. Again, they utilise multiple platforms, multiple identities and therefore require—you guessed it!—bespoke, nuanced and well-thought-through legislative responses that address this and hold people to account for their actions while also dealing with the deep-rooted causes for why people behave in this way, particularly to groups such as women, queer folk or people of colour. These are the groups which overwhelmingly experience this online facilitated abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People who work in this area understand these social complexities and the bespoke policy responses needed. If you speak to them, they're really willing to give you this information. I have learnt so much from working in this area over this period of time. There are folk who are absolutely committed and who deeply and genuinely want to see action in all three of these areas to make sure that people are not subjected to violence, abuse or exploitation in any context or setting. Those people and their genuinely held beliefs are often driven by a lived experience with this type of phenomenon, and they should be honoured, respected and appropriately engaged with. We—well, I say 'we', but the major parties as the parties of power in this place—should do them the honour and respect always of engaging thoroughly and in detail with them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not what has occurred in relation to the creation of these bills. The government have cited a response to a piece of evidence that was given to them as the result of an inquiry report in 2018, and there have been many years intervening since then. The reality of this legislation before this chamber right now is that it's totally and utterly undercooked; it has been rammed through in the smallest possible time. First, the government published an exposure draft of the legislation, and they allowed merely a number of weeks for submitters to give their evidence in relation to what the final piece of legislation should look like. Then the government introduced the legislation and attempted to pass it through during a section of this chamber's time when it would be open to no amendment nor to a vote of opposition. When they figured out they couldn't do that—</span>

Professor Chiou was a deeply respected and highly regarded leader in the Australian Taiwanese community who provided outstanding service both to the people of Australia and to the people of Taiwan. I note the presence in the gallery of members of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Australia, including deputy representative Mr Ken Lai, officer Ms Kristy Cheng and officer Mr Vincent Wang, and I sincerely thank them for their presence in the chamber today.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Chiou was born in Taiwan in 1938. After graduating from the National Taiwan University, he continued his studies in the United States, obtaining a doctorate in 1971. He then chose to make a life for himself and his family in Australia and became naturalised in 1974. During the course of his life, he made three outstanding contributions to both Australia and Taiwan—first, in the area of education. For over 40 years, he served in the faculty of political science at the University of Queensland, my alma mater, with great distinction and great honour. He inspired countless students at the University of Queensland who have gone on to take positions of great responsibility in our nation. This was reinforced to me when I attended the Double Ten Day Taiwanese celebration dinner in 2019. I was honoured to sit next to Professor Chiou, and he recounted to me how one of his favourite students was the Hon. George Brandis, who served in this chamber as Leader of the Government in the Senate for many years with great distinction. In fact, I sent to my good friend George Brandis a photograph of myself and Professor Chiou sitting together, and George immediately responded affectionately, saying how much Professor Chiou meant to him. This scholarship and this education were based on a deep intellectual base. I was greatly interested to go back and review Professor Chiou's work <span style="font-style:italic;">Maoism in Action: The Cultural Revolution</span>, and there was so many lessons from this book that have resonance in the world today. So that was the first aspect of Professor Chiou's great contribution to our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second was his promotion of the relationship between Australia and Taiwan. Professor Chiou was always close to his Hakka culture and did much to keep that culture alive and prospering in Australia, including in my home state of Queensland. In 1993, he founded the Taiwan Institute in Australia. During his frequent trips and visits to Taiwan and to many other nations around the world, he promoted harmonious relationships between Taiwan and Australia and between Taiwan and many other countries around the world. Just reflect for a moment that the fact that Professor Chiou was so well regarded both in Taiwan and in Australia made his contribution both to Taiwan and to Australia and to the relationship between the people of Taiwan and Australia so special, such a unique contribution from such a unique individual.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Third and perhaps, for me, most moving was Professor Chiou's deep commitment to the spirit of democracy. Many times that commitment potentially led him into danger and many times he had to make personal life choices to honour that spirit of democracy throughout his life. For me that is perhaps the most moving contribution that Professor Chiou made. In reading many of the articles which Professor Chiou wrote over his time as a leading intellectual in this country, and as a contributor to the intellectual life in both Taiwan and Australia, I was consistently moved by how much he cherished that spirit of democracy. There was a simplicity and a purity to that commitment, which I think everyone serving in this chamber would do well to remember. Professor Chiou's service to our country was recognised by Australia in 2003 through the award of a Centenary Medal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should also remember that Professor Chiou was a beloved husband to Flora, a beloved father and father-in-law of Grace, Michael, Leon, Kim and Sue, and a treasured grandfather of Rachel, Lucy, Emma, Sam, Joseph and Caitlyn. When I attended Professor Chiou's memorial service I was greatly moved by the contribution of his grandchildren on that day. I'm sure Professor Chiou would have been incredibly touched by how they contributed to his memory on that day. There is perhaps nothing more special than the love between a grandparent and their grandchildren.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is truly blessed that Professor Chiou and his wife Flora chose to make a home in our beautiful country in Australia, just as we are truly blessed that we have such a vibrant Australian Taiwanese community and just as we are truly blessed that we have such positive relations with the people of Taiwan. Professor Chiou's contribution to education and to promoting the relationship between Australia and Taiwan, and his passion for the spirit of democracy, is an example to inspire all Australians, regardless of their background. Professor Chiou's story is part of who we are as modern-day Australians. It is now part of the Australian story. Professor Chiou's commitment to democracy and the purity of his belief in the spirit of democracy should serve as an inspiration to all of us who have the honour to sit in this chamber in this Australian parliament. It is now truly fit and proper that Professor Chiou's legacy be recorded in the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Hansard </span>of the Senate, at the heart of Australia's democracy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="252157" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WALSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  This Liberal government is now eight years old and if it were a child it would be in grade 3. It would have lost some baby teeth. It would know how to read and write. It would be learning some valuable life lessons. So let's look back on this eight-year-old government and see just how they're tracking against the key lessons that all Australians try to teach their children. Lesson 1 is actions speak louder than words. When the pandemic started, Prime Minister Morrison thanked our essential workers time and again but the pandemic only magnified just how dangerous insecure work and low wages are, and just how many essential workers are themselves insecure. Did the Prime Minister show his thanks with a good, secure jobs plan? No. Did he show his thanks with a rise in real wages? No. Did he show his thanks by fighting against wage theft? No, no, no. Instead, he introduced a bill to parliament that would have cut workers' wages and increased their job insecurity—fail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lesson 2 is take responsibility. We've seen over the past few years that Prime Minister Morrison is not a huge fan of this life lesson. On the devastating bushfires he told us that he doesn't hold a hose. On the tragic deaths in aged care last year he told us that it's a problem for the states. On the alleged sexual assault of Brittany Higgins, metres from his office, he said he didn't know about it. On the allegations against Minister Porter, he said he didn't read them. On vaccines and quarantine facilities, again, it's a matter for the states. Whatever the situation, if it casts a bad light on himself or his government Prime Minister Morrison refuses to take responsibility. When we say, 'Wash your hands, Prime Minister,' we don't mean of everything.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lesson 3 is respect your elders. Aged care has been in crisis for so long now, long before the pandemic started, but the Morrison government has failed to act time and again for a sector that is in desperate need of help. They sat on report after report as the horror stories unfolded. Even today, after the royal commission and after the budget, there is still no plan to deliver the stable, well-trained workforce that must be the foundation of our aged-care system. Workers are still in need of good, secure jobs, and there can be no solution to the aged-care crisis without them. Our elders in aged care and the workers who care for them deserve so much better from this government. Fail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lesson 4 is don't kick people while they're down. This has been a hard lesson for this government to learn. Robodebt was introduced by the Prime Minister himself. It was a nasty scheme that targeted vulnerable Australians with illegal debt notices. It destroyed lives; tragically, it led to suicides. The Liberals purposely targeted vulnerable Australians on income support. They only stopped when they were dragged into court. They've now been forced to pay back $1.8 billion to the Australians they hounded. Last week, a judge described robodebt as a 'shameful chapter' and a 'massive failure' after hearing what he called 'heart-wrenching stories' of pain and anguish from victims. Fail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lesson 5 is learn from your mistakes. After 21 breaches in hotel quarantine across the country, you would think that the Morrison government would realise that their approach is not working and that more needs to be done to keep Australians safe and to keep Australia running. You would think they would realise that it is time for them to step up and build safe, fit-for-purpose national quarantine facilities, as they were told to do by their hand-picked advisor Jane Halton last October. How many more breaches in hotel quarantine do we need to have before this government realises that it isn't working? How many more before they commit to building open-air facilities in every state and territory? Fail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lesson 6 is be honest and tell the truth. This one has been particularly tricky for the Morrison government. This government just hasn't been the most transparent and honest of governments. From sports rorts to safer seats rorts, from airport rorts to jobs for mates, this government seems to have a problem with honesty and transparency. They are eight years old but have failed to establish the national integrity commission that Australians so want to see to help restore their faith in government. Fail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lesson 7 is value your education. Over their term in office, the Liberal government have slashed apprenticeships and gutted funding from TAFEs right around Australia. Last year Scott Morrison, the Prime Minister, pushed through a bill that cut a billion dollars from university funding, put uni jobs at risk and doubled the cost of uni degrees for thousands of Australians, making it harder for people to even access university, especially women. Fail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lesson 8 is to share. During the pandemic, Prime Minister Morrison was pushed into a nationwide wage subsidy for Australian workers and businesses. Who did he choose to exclude? He chose thousands of Australia's most insecure workers: casual workers, hospitality workers, gig workers, university workers and more—workers in some of the hardest hit and most insecure industries. Yet big and profitable businesses like Harvey Norman were able to pocket JobKeeper and still don't have to repay the millions of dollars the government handed out to them. After excluding so many insecure workers, Prime Minister Morrison then told them to smash open their piggy banks and raid their own super. Instead of sharing the burden equally and helping all Australians, he told some of the most insecure Australians to fund their own pandemic support. Fail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lesson 9 is treat others as you would want to be treated yourself. Apparently the Morrison government needs empathy training to understand this basic lesson that Australians try to teach their own children. Recently, Prime Minister Morrison couldn't even sympathise with Brittany Higgins until he looked at her through the lens of a father and his daughters. He is still actively supporting a known miscreant in his party room: Andrew Laming, the member for Bowman, who harasses the women in his community that he is meant to represent. The Prime Minister speaks over women in his own party when they are being asked about women's issues within his government and, time and again, Prime Minister Morrison has failed to stand up for women. He has failed to stand up for the women in his party, for the women in this parliament and for the women of Australia—fail, fail, fail!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lesson 10 is to apologise when you are in the wrong. Despite all the harm and all the hurt that this government has left in its wake, saying sorry seems to be the hardest thing to do for the Morrison government. It's always, 'I regret,' or, 'I'm sorry you felt that way.' Maybe one of these days this government will finally learn the difference between skirting around the S-word and a genuine apology, the genuine apology that so many Australians deserve from this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has failed the basic tests that we want all children to pass, the tests that mean a child will eventually grow up into a well-rounded adult, a responsible and kind person who treats people with respect and plays their part. So will this government ever grow up? Will it grow up and do better? Or can Australians just expect more of the same—a tax on wages and job security, a tax on vulnerable Australians, more rorts, more lies, more cover-ups, disrespect for the women of this country, more buck passing and more blame shifting? Australians have had enough of waiting for this eight-year government to finally grow up and to finally learn the life lessons that everyone else in our community seems to understand.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="250156" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEELE-JOHN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:01</span>):  The National Disability Insurance Scheme was created to give disabled people what we need to live a good life, just like everyone else. It was supposed to be guided by our goals and our lived experience and informed by the expertise of the professionals that we know and trust. The Liberal government are trying to undermine these key principles of how our NDIS works to make it more difficult for disabled people to get the supports we need. If this weren't bad enough, they are also trying to make it so that key NDIS decision-makers no longer have to listen to the evidence provided by our trusted doctors and specialists. Instead, they want to force disabled people to be assessed by a stranger who is paid by a private corporation and has no understanding of the person they're assessing or their disability. Under these changes, it will be so much more difficult to get the funding for the supports we need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that it doesn't have to be this way, that the Liberals can only make these changes if they are able to change the law. We know that disabled people across the country are united in a campaign to prevent this from happening, to protect the NDIS from the Morrison government and to ensure that every disabled person has what they need to live a good life and that the scheme works to that purpose. Today, I want to take head-on one of the key justifications the government has put forward for the need for these so-called changes, and that is the question of cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, which is very happy to fritter away tens of billions of dollars on defunct defence projects, has recently discovered a desire to rein in spending on certain projects and has taken aim at the NDIS. However, if we look at the actual figures of the cost of the agency and the cost of this scheme, we see a very different story. Every single budget since the NDIS was created up until the last two years of financial information revealed a scheme that was running a significant underspend. There were very many good reasons for the existence of this underspend and, at every point, disabled people in our organisations said clearly to the government: 'Keep that money in the scheme. Save it for a rainy day so that, if costs ever go up higher than expected, that money is there to cover that.' This underspend trend culminated in 2019 with a $4.6 billion underspend in the scheme and what it actually cost in that year. Again disabled people said very clearly to the government, 'Keep that money in the scheme, because at some point it will be needed.' Instead, the Morrison government made the decision to take that money and put it into general consolidated revenue, to put it back in the overall pot and not keep it aligned with the agency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What happened the next year? Just as disabled people had predicted, the scheme ran at a slightly higher cost than was expected—about $1.1 billion. Now, the next year, so this last budget, again saw the scheme run a little higher than expected. Had the government listened to disabled people and retained that $4.6 billion within the scheme, then today, as we sit here, the NDIS would still be running under budget. The fact that it is running slightly above what it was projected to, slightly more than what is allocated to it, is a direct result of the Morrison government's decision in 2019 to take the underspent money and put it back into consolidated revenue. Why? So that they could have their 'Back in black' budget moment. So that Josh Frydenberg could sit there with his nice little black mug and pat himself on the back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everything beyond that moment in time, everything beyond the last set of figures that we had from the last budget, speaking to the actualised cost of the NDIS—which, again, I cannot overstate; it runs at a slight overspend because of a decision the Morrison government made—everything beyond that point are projections, estimations, predictions. And so it is legitimate that the community of disabled people, who are staring down the barrel of these terrifying changes being justified because of an increase in the cost of the scheme, wish to scrutinise the underlying assumptions that underpin those estimations and those projections. And that is exactly what the disability community have asked the government for, have asked the agency for. We have said very clearly: 'Give us your financial sustainability report. Give us the assumptions which underpin your actuarial modelling.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it that we want those figures? Well, we want them because, between October of last year and today, the government's projections of the cost of the NDIS in the forward years have gone from $25 billion, to $30 billion, to $40 billion as I sit here today. And when you have such wild increases in the projected cost of something, it is really quite reasonable to want to see the assumptions that underpin those projections, particularly when the supposed cost of this scheme, which has increased from $25 billion to $40 billion, has tracked perfectly with the pressure being applied to this government to drop these terrible changes to our NDIS. It's almost as though they were racking up the figures to try to pressure the crossbench into passing this legislation. Who would have thunk it from this mob?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to make very clear that the proposed changes that the government are putting forward are very likely to have adverse consequences upon communities that the government have not factored in. And one which gets very little coverage, but is critically important, is the impact of these changes upon allied health professionals working in rural and regional communities. The government are proposing that allied health professionals be contracted to undertake so-called independent assessments of disabled people. These are physios, these are psychologists, these are occupational therapists—and often these are people who have never worked in these particular fields with these particular participants. They are currently working, right now, in the mainstream of the allied health profession in rural and regional Australia. These are communities that we know are chronically understaffed and under-resourced by these professions, and it is the proposition of this government that they would divert those allied health professionals from playing that generalised role to playing this specific role of functioning for the NDIS as assessors. This means there will be fewer of these professionals for the general community, something which has been flagged with us again and again by the peak bodies of these organisations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the final minutes, I also want to draw the community's attention and the chamber's attention to the commentary of Professor Bruce Bonyhady, who is rightly regarded as the architect of the NDIS. He gave evidence before the inquiry into these changes and said very clearly that the cost pressures on the scheme that do exist are the result of government inaction in relation to the broader disability sector and what is needed to support disabled people who are not themselves NDIS participants. This government has had control of the agency almost since its inception and has comprehensively failed to develop the tier 2 supports that are needed to support people who are not themselves NDIS participants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Bonyhady drew our attention particularly to the ways in which this series of changes conflicts with the original intent of the scheme, and he is right to have done that. He also brought our attention to the fact that, had the Morrison government done its job over the past seven years and worked with the states and territories to develop comprehensive alternatives to coming into contact with the NDIS, there would not be the certain cost pressures that there are upon the scheme. The Morrison government are attempting to make their failures and their decisions disabled people's problems, and that is not okay.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="273828" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUGHES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:11</span>):  I've been a little bit vocal of late around the NDIS and the proposed independent assessments. But the reality is that I have been vocal for a lot longer around the issue of autism. So today I wanted to personally thank all of the families of children with autism and all of the autistic adults who've written to me over the past couple of weeks thanking me for being in their corner. Their stories are like my family's: concern for our children and what the future has in store for them; and how we can best ensure that their life is filled with opportunity and, even more importantly than that, that it's filled with dignity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most concerning issues that I have had raised with me in a number of instances was that we're seeing that the NDIA is currently refusing to fund evidence and research based best practice therapies for autism, claiming that they are not reasonable and necessary. I mean, seriously—best practice, globally recognised with evidence and research, not reasonable or necessary! I really would like to know what they consider is reasonable and necessary then.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what is actually more concerning when you consider this is the number of families who've now been forced to go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This is not being upheld as a decision. Either it's sorted out before or, once it hits the tribunal, best practice, evidence and research based behavioural interventions are deemed reasonable and necessary because they are best practice. So, at a time when we're talking about sustainability of the scheme and ensuring that it is there for the future of all people with a disability and, in fact, for all Australians—because you never know when you or a family member might require the scheme—we are seeing costs being expended in fighting families who want best-practice therapy for their children, who want to use evidence and research based therapies, and forcing them through an expensive process at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal with, of course, agency lawyers fighting against them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what I thought I would do is explain to people what best practice early intervention looks like for autism. This isn't my opinion. This isn't just my thoughts on the matter. This is something that is globally recognised. We talk quite often about the US's health system not being as amazing and about how we're so fortunate to have universal health care here in Australia—they have an insurance model over in the US—but the only therapy that is covered in every single state in the US by all insurers, absolutely, in law, is best practice behavioural intervention known as ABA, applied behavioural analysis. I know there are people out there that are about to freak out, because ABA has some connotations which are not founded in fact but are founded in thoughts and beliefs going back decades, but we might move to 'early intensive behavioural intervention' as a name to try and moderate the ABA hysteria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we go back to DSS, the government's own department, and we look at the good practice guidelines for autism—for some reason they changed from 'best practice' to 'good practice'—under the Helping Children with Autism package, the only evidence and research based therapies that were approved were ABA and EIBI, early intensive behavioural intervention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you go to the Raising Children Network—look at it up, because it's run by the government and it's up to speed with a very well maintained site. It's great resource for parents of all children. They actually have tabs there on the front page on their website for autism and disability. You don't even have to go digging for them. When you click on 'Autism' and you look at therapies, the very first therapy that comes up is applied behaviour analysis. But this is deemed, when parents ask for it, unreasonable and unnecessary. That is, until it gets to the AAT, and thankfully those families are receiving the funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want to look overseas at the National Autism Centre, a very well-respected agency in the United States, they've actually listed 14 established interventions for children, adolescents and also young adults. In fact, they also included intervention established and identified for adults, and every single one of them, including the very first one, looks at behavioural interventions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because most people don't understand what a behaviour is, people think a behaviour is a tantrum. You're having a bad day and you have a little bit of a wobble: they think that's a behaviour. Behaviour is everything we do. A behaviour is washing your hands, something we've been encouraging people to do a lot of recently! But I bet people don't know there are nine steps to washing your hands, and, when kids with autism are taught to wash their hands, we teach them in a way called backward chaining. We reinforce positively, we reward, we celebrate them getting the steps right. We start with the drying of the hands because that's the last step, and we teach them backwards as we go through every step. The only thing we don't teach backwards is riding a bike, because you've got to put your helmet on first! So there is a little safety element to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even in Australia recently there's been a research study done in a bid to debunk this obsession that ABA or behavioural interventions are somehow a form of torture. Monash University, along with the Autism Behavioural Intervention Association, ABIA, have done a study. I don't have time today to run through all of it, but I would like to just highlight a couple of things for you. One of the things we hear is that ABA and behavioural interventions are clinic based, that somehow they're not natural; they don't occur in the home or the natural environment. When this survey was done of practitioners and families and participants, they found that 88 per cent of therapy is actually done in the home. I would have thought that's a pretty natural setting where you can teach kids what they need to learn—not in a clinic, not in a centre but in the home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clinic based programs play a vital role as well. The reason that they are so important is one of the things we do see in families with autism, but also families with disability more broadly, is that very often one of the parents is forced out of work. I know this. When we ran our intensive early intervention program, I didn't work; I worked from home. I set up an autism charity. I didn't get paid for a few years, which is pretty difficult when you're funding an incredibly expensive and intensive early intervention program, but those are the sacrifices that families made pre NDIS and they're the sacrifices that families continue to make even with the NDIS, but they certainly don't need the additional hurdle of being told that best practice therapy is not reasonable or necessary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You might ask why the agency would oppose this considering this is an insurance scheme—invest early: better outcome. Synergies Economic Consulting have done a research project on this, and what they established is that every dollar we spend on intensive early intervention will save the community $11 over the course of the life of that child. It adds up to a saving of almost $2 million per child, if we give the intensive, quality early intervention that's required. Why would they oppose a therapy that actually takes data in every session? There's no wrong answer: they either get it right or they're prompted to do it. There's no right or wrong. No-one's punishing the child. But we have data. When we're teaching them to hold a pencil, or put their pants on, or toilet-train or sit at the dinner table and use a fork, we take data every step of the way. So, why wouldn't an agency that is fundamentally giving taxpayers' monies to families and to people with a disability want to see what they're getting for their buck? I would have thought that would be a logical therapy option for them to look at.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to point out that some of the detractors are vicious and unnecessarily mean-spirited—and that is the nicest way I can put it. I've received letters telling me that my son's more susceptible to being sexually abused because he had best-practice therapy, that they hope he grows up to hate me and not speak to me anymore because of the best-practice therapy that he received, and that somehow I inflicted torture. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that a number of people in this chamber know the relationship I have with my son, and I think we can probably all agree that he's ridiculously spoiled. He is my favourite human in the world, and I would do anything for him to give him the best opportunity at life. This is the best-practice therapy, and it's about time we recognised it and funded it properly.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:21</span>): I want to thank Senator Hughes and Senator Steele-John for their contributions in regard to the NDIS. I know their personal advocacy is recognised by members across this chamber. In working with them on the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, I've learnt a lot more about the NDIS. I'm sure there's a lot more for me to learn—and a lot of questions for the government to answer about changes that are being proposed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, I was lucky enough to watch the State of Origin, game 1, in a brand-new North Queensland stadium. I want to congratulate the town of Townsville, especially the mayor, Jenny Hill, on the success of the event—despite the score, which we will not mention today. Every time I visit Townsville, I get asked one very important question, and this visit was no different. Every time I visit Townsville I get asked: where is the $195 million of funding that the member for Herbert, Phillip Thompson, committed to Townsville at the last election?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be very clear about this funding and how it has been misconstrued through comments by the member for Herbert about whether he is responsible for delivering it. Here's a brief history of the funding and the announcements. In 2019, before the last election, the LNP promised this funding to build stage 2 of the Haughton pipeline—a $195 million election promise, to win the seat of Herbert. At one stage, shortly after being elected, the member for Herbert actually pulled support for this project in an embarrassing Facebook video that he later had to retract. The federal government refused to provide the funding with no strings attached to the state government, so the state government decided that they would step in themselves and fund the pipeline directly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has now been over 300 days since the member for Herbert said that the funding would remain in Townsville, that the $195 million would still go to projects and jobs in Townsville. Despite that commitment, not a single dollar of that funding has been committed to a single project and not a single job has been created. This is more than two years after this commitment was made to the people of Townsville.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Thompson told the <span style="font-style:italic;">Townsville Bulletin</span> a few months ago that he had a new set of projects and that the money was ready to go but that the state Labor government was holding it up for political reasons. Give me a break. At the last Senate estimates we asked the department if this was the case, and—surprise, surprise—they had seen the list of projects, but those projects had not received final approval from the federal government. The answer was clearly no. The member for Herbert is incorrect in saying that the money is being held up for political reasons. They haven't even provided final approval yet. In fact, there isn't even a time line yet of when it might be approved—and, again, embarrassingly for Mr Thompson, he was forced to agree with these assumptions in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Townsville Bulletin </span>when he confirmed that the projects that not been finally reviewed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So not only has Mr Thompson not delivered on his big election promise, but he has been running around telling his constituents that the state government ate his homework and actually it's not his fault that he has not delivered on the promise that he made. Why has there been such a monumental failure to the people of Townsville? Why is it that this funding cannot be delivered by Mr Thompson and by the LNP, despite the big promises made before the election?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that it's because Mr Thompson is Mr Morrison's mate in Canberra and is not a friend of Townsville's. You see, he likes to pick fights in Townsville with state MPs and then come to Canberra and use parliamentary privilege to slag off state MPs about state based issues. He does that a lot. He picks a lot of fights. But, when it comes to the things that he has promised to deliver and when it comes to picking fights on behalf of the people of Townsville for the things that he's responsible for—well, that simply doesn't happen. Mr Thompson has been absolutely pathetic, in my opinion, about this funding and whether it should be delivered by the federal government. He is happy to keep the Prime Minister happy but disappoint his constituents. Again, that's not my word; Mr Thompson said that he is disappointed himself in his own failure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, at the Origin, in Townsville, Mr Thompson posted a photo of what can only be described as a weird, fanboy moment, FaceTiming Scott Morrison at the football. If Mr Thompson can FaceTime the Prime Minister at the footy, why can't he get the Prime Minister on the phone, face-to-face, or even FaceTime his best mate Mr Morrison and demand that this funding be delivered? In the two years since he has been elected, he has failed to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Townsville deserves an MP who will actually fight for them, not lie down because their mate the Prime Minister has decided that North Queensland—or, more specifically, Townsville—isn't a priority right now. When it comes to Medicare, aged care, the cashless debit card or the NDIS, people in Townsville need to know whether Mr Thompson has their back or Mr Morrison's back, because we know that this government sent robodebt notices to people in Townsville in the aftermath of the floods—that's what they did to people in Townsville. We know that this government are attacking Medicare. We know that they've failed to deliver vaccinations to aged-care workers. We know, as we've heard today, that they're making fundamental changes to the NDIS in a region where it's already difficult to get NDIS services, and we know that there is the potential for this government to roll out the cashless debit card to more regions and to pensioners. So people in Queensland and people in Townsville need to know that Mr Thompson has their back, and what we clearly know, from what has happened with the Haughton pipeline funding, is that that is not the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This tired, eight-year-old government is just one inadequacy after the next. The LNP is dangerously slow when it comes to the vaccine rollout in this country. We know that, thanks to Scott Morrison's abysmal vaccine rollout, the national borders are going to remain closed for far longer than they should. Nobody here thinks that the borders should be open despite the health advice. Everyone respects that health advice. But the health advice is determined by our vaccine rollout—we know that. While the rest of the world begins to open up, thanks to high uptake of vaccines, Australia will be losing billions upon billions of dollars in tourism revenue, thanks to the LNP's 'not a race' strategy. Well, I can tell you, regional Queenslanders, it is a race. Getting vaccines out is a race. We've been in this pandemic for more than a year, and the Prime Minister still can't get quarantine right and he still can't get vaccines right. There are no more excuses anymore for the Prime Minister's failure to step up and do his job on vaccines and quarantine. The budget made an assumption about when the vaccine rollout would allow for the borders to open, and it wasn't until mid next year. So that means that a year from now tourism operators in regional Queensland will still be waiting for international visitors to visit them, and this Prime Minister says that the vaccine rollout isn't a race.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we want to see from the members opposite and from members in the other place isn't patting Mr Morrison on the back and protecting him for his failures but standing up for your communities and doing what you were elected to do: support your communities through this. It is not acceptable that this government has failed to roll out the vaccine quickly enough to make sure that we keep up with the rest of the world. We get a lot of comparisons with the rest of the world, and this government likes to make them often, but what we know is that other countries are opening up and that international tourism operators in Cairns will be left behind if this government does not successfully deliver a quarantine program and a vaccine program that mean that we are ahead of the race. We should be at the front of the race, not the back of the race. We were always told by this government that we were at the front of the queue. Well, we are at the back of the queue, and people in Queensland are catching on.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  I would like to take this opportunity to update the Senate on matters relating to my legal appeal against Prime Morrison's attempt to apply cabinet secrecy to block scrutiny of the national cabinet decision-making on Australia's COVID-19 response. As some senators will be aware, I have appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against the decision by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 to withhold from release minutes of the so-called national cabinet. The department, in accordance with the Prime Minister's assertion that national cabinet is part of the federal cabinet, has withheld the minutes of national cabinet on the grounds that they are cabinet documents that are entirely and unconditionally exempt from FOI release. The reasons behind that assertion were entirely political. Fearful that aspects of Australia's COVID-19 response would prove politically contentious, the Prime Minister wanted to cloak national decision-making in absolute secrecy. The Prime Minister did not ask the parliament to change the law. He just declared that national cabinet was to be part of the federal cabinet and, as such, exempt under the cabinet secrecy exemption of the FOI Act. Indeed, this is the basis of purported public interest immunity claims made to the Senate's COVID committee. The matter was deemed of such significance that it was heard by Federal Court Justice Richard White on 19 May. We are now awaiting His Honour's decision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators should be aware that this is no run-of-the-mill AAT case. The issues that we argued before the tribunal go to the very heart of responsible cabinet government in Australia. At the centre of the proceedings is the Prime Minister's assertion, defended in sworn affidavits by senior officers of his department—most notably the Secretary of PM&amp;C, Mr Phil Gaetjens—that the Prime Minister has absolute authority to determine the membership, structure and meetings of the cabinet without regard for long-established cabinet conventions and practices, because that is precisely what the Prime Minister has done in claiming that the national cabinet is part of the federal cabinet and consequently is covered by absolute secrecy exemptions under FOI laws.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">National cabinet comprises a single Commonwealth minister, the Prime Minister; the premiers of the states; and the chief ministers of the territories. Unlike the federal cabinet or, for that matter, state cabinets, the national cabinet is not a meeting of ministers who are ministers of a single government and collectively responsible to a single parliament. All the conventions of cabinet government, of collective responsibility and confidentiality, revolve around the core concept that cabinet is a collective, a council, of ministers, who form a single government responsible to a single parliament. Cabinet is not mentioned in the Australian Constitution, and it's barely mentioned in legislation—indeed, only in the FOI Act and the Archives Act—but cabinet government is a political institution that predates our federation. It goes back to King George II. It has operated in accordance with well-established conventions throughout our life as a nation. Cabinet is a political mechanism that seeks to reconcile the individual responsibilities of ministers for the administration of their departments with their collective accountability to the parliament. A gathering of a body such as national cabinet, a meeting of federal, state and territory heads of government, is quite outside what has been understood to be a 'cabinet' for well over a century. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the AAT proceedings showed, while national cabinet is nothing special as an intergovernmental body—arguably it is just the Council of Australian Governments by another name—it is without precedent that it is claimed to be part of the federal cabinet. The officers of the Prime Minister's department did try to claim some historical precedence, but they were obliged to concede in the hearing that their scholarship was quite incorrect. In the end, the government's defence of its claim was left resting solely on the assertion of the Prime Minister and his advisers. Those claims sound very much like the logic of Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll's <span style="font-style:italic;">Through the Looking-Glass</span>. In that wonderful, surreal classic, Humpty Dumpty declares, 'When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean, neither more nor less.' Alice replies, 'The question is whether you can make words mean so many different things.' Humpty Dumpty replies: 'The question is which is to be the master. That's all.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the question here. The Prime Minister claims he is the absolute master, able to define cabinet government however he likes to suit his political purposes. Can the PM say that cabinet is whatever he wants it to be, or do the conventions that have for so long defined cabinet as a collective of ministers impose some fundamental restraint on the PM's political authority? Because if the PM's position is accepted—that he has absolute discretion to define the federal cabinet in any way he deems fit—a severe blow will have been dealt against the long-established conventions of responsible cabinet government in Australia. If it is accepted that he can deem a meeting at which just one federal minister is present, even if it is the Prime Minister, to be a cabinet meeting then it's open for the Prime Minister to declare any meeting with just about anyone as a cabinet meeting, shrouded in secrecy. Meetings between the PM and lobbyists or political donors could be deemed cabinet meetings. Such a state of affairs would unquestionably undermine our democratic parliamentary system. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It remains to be seen what Justice White will decide in this landmark case. There will also be the question of whether his decision, whichever way it goes, will be appealed to the full Federal Court or eventually even to the High Court. PM&amp;C, in their submissions, foreshadowed such an event. Whatever the outcome, whether or not our 'Humpty Dumpty' PM is knocked off his pedestal, this has been and will continue to be an important fight for me. Freedom of information is absolutely critical for political transparency, accountability and the preservation of responsible government. It's about making sure that not just members and senators but also members of the public can participate in our democracy in an informed way. It provides them with a mechanism of oversight and scrutiny. It allows them to congratulate and to criticise. It's extremely important and, therefore, it's a battle that I will continue to fight, to protect the integrity of our democracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I would like to thank my legal representatives, senior counsel Geoffrey Watson and counsel Diana Tang, for assisting pro bono in this important transparency fight. Their finely honed arguments have been impressively effective in forensically demolishing claims made by the Prime Minister's representatives. They could have been doing other highly-paid work but they chose to weigh in and help me in this important battle to protect our system of responsible, democratic government. Many thanks again to Geoffrey and Diana.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="217241" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McGRATH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  I rise to pay tribute to a man who made an incredible contribution to my home state of Queensland and to my party, Sir Llewellyn Roy Edwards AC. Sir Llew first left school at 15 and started out as an electrician, working in the family business in Ipswich. A few years later a fall from a ladder would see him in hospital with a broken back. He spent his time recovering in hospital thinking, and he decided to change the course of his life. He finished school, and he went on to study medicine and become a doctor. It was while he was working as a local GP in Ipswich that another great of Queensland politics, Sir Gordon Chalk, paid him a visit and convinced him to run for state parliament, for the seat of Ipswich. While he was considered an outside chance—Ipswich is Labor heartland—his personal popularity and respect in the community saw him defy the political odds of the day and become the first Liberal member for Ipswich in 1972.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 1970s and 1980s was a time when Queensland was coming into its own, and Sir Llew was a steady hand on the tiller. He was promoted to become the state's health minister in 1974 before going on to become Deputy Premier and Treasurer, working with the great Sir Joh. Quietly determined, Sir Llew was a true coalitionist, working with colleagues across the political spectrum to modernise the health system and invest in regional hospitals, and to build the roads and dams that would help our state prosper for decades. Sir Llew was a builder of modern Queensland. Sir Llew knew that Queensland was brimming with potential, full of passionate people and brilliant ideas, a place blessed not just with good weather and plenty of bananas but with a great story to tell and an exciting future ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir Llew knew that the best days of Queensland were in the future, so he took that opportunity to share the story with the world when he left parliament in 1983 and became CEO and chairman of Expo 88, an event that would capture the imagination of a generation and transform Brisbane from a big country town to an ever-growing city. I can remember driving down from Innisfail with my parents to visit Expo 88. For those at that age, we got a passport, and, being the cheeky kid I was, I learnt that you didn't go in the front entrance of all the exhibits; you could go in the back entrance and still get your passport stamped without having to go through the rigmarole of going through all the displays!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir Llew went on to use his expertise in private enterprise, most notably in his work as a director of James Hardie Industries and chairman of the Medical Research and Compensation Foundation, established to compensate asbestos victims. In 1993 he was elected the 12th chancellor of his alma mater, the University of Queensland—a role he held until 2009. In that time he shook the hands of no fewer than 88,000 excited graduates at graduation ceremonies. Fittingly a building at the university's St Lucia campus is named in honour of his contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir Llew was a giant of my party and, more importantly, a giant of Queensland politics. He was a true gentleman of the old school who had no concept of prejudice. He offered wise counsel to many and extended a warm greeting to all. He leaves a truly incredible legacy that his loving family attributes to hard work, sacrifice and a dedication to community service. On behalf of my party, the Liberal National Party: thank you, Sir Llew, for your vision, your determination and your service to the people of Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, what are we going to do about the ABC? What are we going to do about the taxpayer funded Australian Broadcasting Corporation? This ABC has become this mosh pit of Labor-Green wokeness. The ABC needs to be urgently reformed to save itself. At the moment, the ABC seems to be run by a staff based workers' collective who are in control of the joint, a cabal who demand diversity, except when it comes to diversity of political opinions. The ABC workers' collective who are running this billion-dollar taxpayer funded organisation need to understand that taxpayers are sick of funding this opinionated, gobby blob. Twenty years ago, disaffected viewers of the ABC had no choice of where they could go. There was little plurality in the media market. What the ABC fails to understand is that centre-Right listeners and viewers now have options. We can go to streaming services. We can go to Sky News. We can go to the web to get our news sources. And so the ABC fails to understand that it is losing generations of centre-Right thought leaders. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation is no longer the national broadcaster. Indeed, it is becoming the un-Australian national broadcaster, a broadcaster that only accepts views of the centre Left or the far Left.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a fan of the ABC and I have a three-point plan to help save the ABC from itself. We need to sell all of the inner-city offices. We need to sell the headquarters in Brisbane, in Sydney at Ultimo and in Melbourne. Sell them off. Move the staff to the regions or to the suburbs. I notice that today the ABC have said they are shifting 300 staff from Ultimo to Parramatta. That's a good start. They get half a tick for that. But they should shift all the staff from Ultimo and sell the building. I will put an ad on Gumtree or the Trading Post and sell it. It's worth about $300 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to review the ABC Act and charter to make it fit for purpose. But, in the meantime, let's sell Triple J. Triple J, as the ABC keeps telling us, does quite well in the ratings. Well, brilliant. If it was designed to fill a gap in the market and if the market is happy to pay for it let's also put Triple J on the Trading Post or Gumtree and sell it off. The taxpayers don't need to fund it. We should also put ads on the ABC. If the ABC is that good, let commercial businesses and commercial operators put ads on the ABC, as we have done with SBS, to take the burden off the taxpayers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should also open up staff recruitment. This goes to an earlier comment. The ABC seem to believe in diversity, and they are very good at making sure they talk about how diverse they are. But they are not diverse when it comes to their staff selection. I'm sure there are many good and great people who work at the ABC, but they all tend to be left wing. They all tend to be quite left wing. There used to be a kids' game called <span style="font-style:italic;">Where's Wally</span><span style="font-style:italic;">?</span> If you try and find at the ABC where the poor conservative is, they're all hiding in a closet somewhere or they're not even in the building. The issue with the ABC is that we need to make sure that the ABC reflects modern Australia, because this bumbling, burbling, taxpayer funded, sneering, tweeting blob takes the taxpayer for granted. On behalf of the taxpayers of Australia, I'm saying enough is enough. If the ABC is not going to represent all of Australia, it is time for reform. If people aren't going to reform the ABC then it's time to send the ABC to the knacker's yard.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STERLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  Where do I begin? No, actually, I'm going to talk about something good. I've got something good to contribute. It gives me great pleasure to share this information with the Senate and those listening all around Australia. I have had the pleasure over the last couple of weeks of running around Perth with a little truck picking up second-hand furniture. Those in this place know that I do a charity run up to Kununurra each year. I work closely with Paige McLachlan, Revive and East Kimberley Job Pathways, and we transport pre-loved furniture that normally ends up in landfill. It goes to Revive, where it's done up, repairs are made, and then it's sold through their shopfront. It gives local people in the East Kimberley an opportunity to access very, very cheap furniture, which they wouldn't be able to otherwise. It's 3,000-odd kilometres from Perth—imagine what furniture would cost by the time they bought it and transported it up there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last couple of weeks before I got back here, I had the opportunity to go on radio 6PR with Steve Mills. Every Western Australian knows Steve Mills. I've known Millsy for a number of years. He has both congratulated me and given me one hell of a grilling. Nothing changes with Millsy; he is a true voice of the people. Millsy gave me the opportunity to talk about what I've been up to on my recent visit to Fitzroy Crossing, where I have been a regular visitor for the last 30 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the privilege of catching up with my very dear friend, Emily Carter. She runs the Marninwarntikura Women's Resource Centre. She's done a magnificent job. Those of us who have been around for a long time will remember Emily's fine work, alongside June Oscar, to—against all odds—reduce the sale of full-strength take-away alcohol in the Fitzroy Valley. I sat with Emily about a month ago and asked her how things were going. It shouldn't come as a shock to us, but it was a shock when she said, 'What we would give to be able to get hold of beds.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We take it for granted that each night we go home to a bed, a clean set of sheets and a blanket, or an electric blanket, but there are many, many people—our Indigenous population—sleeping rough in the Kimberley, not just in Fitzroy and the valley and the 17 communities around there. I'm not just talking about kids and adults; I'm talking about old people who don't have a bed, who may just sleep on a piece of foam on concrete or on the floor in their house.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I spoke to Millsy, I shared my dream to stop throwing beds away because—as long as they're not torn or badly soiled—we can put them to good use, and I've got great friends in the transport industry to assist me. I received a phone call from a gentleman who offered me 100 brand-new king and queen mattresses, which I thought was a magnificent donation; I was absolutely rapt. We'll be picking them up in one of our semis in the next couple of weeks when we leave here. I also got a phone call from my very dear friend who works for other friends of mine, the Quinlivan family, who own the OB hotel in Cottesloe. Senator Brockman, you would know it—not that you're always frequenting the OBH, but every West Aussie knows the OBH. A part of the OBH has backpacker accommodation, which I didn't even know. They kindly donated 40 bunk beds and mattresses, all in great condition. My mates have been down there today to check it out. They are also kindly donating 10 single beds and another 10 double beds on top of that, all in great condition, with mattress liners, pillows, blankets and sheets, for the run to Fitzroy. It is a big deal for the people of Fitzroy; it's a massive deal. I delivered that message to Emily last week when I was up in Fitzroy. They're running through the Fitzroy Valley doing an audit of who wants a bed—who's going to get a bed: which kids and which old people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's something as simple as that. It's something that we just put out on the kerb. We can't give it away because no-one wants these pieces of furniture. Think what joy it may bring to a child or an older person that, for the first time in their life or a very long time, they are actually going to get a bed. They are going to get off the floor; they'll have sheets, pillows and blankets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank David at the OBH very much—mate, I really appreciate that. To my friend, who donated the 100 beds, who does not want any recognition—you know who you are—I thank you sincerely from the bottom of my heart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The beauty of it is, we'll be carting that up in four weeks time on our way to Kununurra. Just touching on that: I've got two full road-trains—four semi-trailers—going up. Part of the deal is that I get to drive one, so there's no downside there! So out come the boots and the old shirt with no sleeves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take the opportunity to sincerely thank my dear friends in the road transport industry, who made this dream come true, who made this possibility in the Kimberley—something that we take for granted, that will be life-changing. To you, Arthur, at ACFS Port Logistics: mate, you've been there from the beginning. Thank you so much for your kind donation. Arthur donates a brand-new prime mover that I get to pedal up. He checks a fuel card at us and off we go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my very dear friend of over 40 years, Nick D'Adamo of KEYS the Moving Solution: without you, Nick, and your team, I don't know what I would do. Nick's one of those ones for whom nothing's impossible. Nick is a part of the Kimberley and the Pilbara as the owner of the largest privately owned furniture removal business in Western Australia. Nick donates the trailers. Nick donates the storage space. Nick donates the containers when I need them. Nick donates his staff, who are my mates as well, to help me load. Nothing is out of Nick's realm of possibility. Absolutely nothing stops Nick being part of this, and for that, Nick, good on you, mate. This year, I hope Nick is going to join me, because he is going to be pedalling one of the prime movers as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to take the opportunity to thank my dear friends at Centurion Transport, a massive transport company. They have celebrated their 50th anniversary this year, and they go back to the days of their founders, Carl and Frank Cardaci. Carl, you are still a mate of mine, and it was great to have you join me last week, coming through the Kimberley to see what we do. It was not your first trip but your second trip. Carl's son, Justin, now runs the trucking business. Centurion have 1,000 full-time employees. They have 2,000 assets out on the highway. They run everywhere between Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland. Justin, thank you, mate, for your support. Justin said to me that he'd throw one of his brand new SARs at me. He said it has 18 gears at the moment, but he also said, 'Sterley, by the time it gets back to Perth, I hope there are still 18 gears.' I'll do my best, Justin, to make sure it gets up there intact. Another dear friend of mine is Cam Dumesny, the CEO of the Western Roads Federation. Cam, for your support, thank you, mate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This leads me back to when we went on the radio and said we wanted some pre-loved furniture, preferably beds. It was a great idea at the time, but I found myself parking out my suit and my Bata Scouts two weeks ago. I put on the boots, and with my mates—and I thank my son, who also helps out—we did 46 pick-ups around the metropolitan area. We have another 19 that we still have to do on top of that. For every bit of furniture that is donated, which may be someone's rubbish, I can't thank you enough for the smiles that you put on the faces of the recipients in the East Kimberley. As I said before, when those of us that have been sheltered living in capital cities talk about the East Kimberley and about people having access to something that we take for granted, when people actually drive from Kalumburu, for those who don't know, it's a 12-hour drive to Kununurra to try and purchase second-hand furniture. People from Wyndham, Warmun, Falls Creek and as far south as Balgo all have to go to Kununurra to get the opportunity to purchase cheap furniture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's another kicker here, because, through East Kimberley Job Pathways and Paige and her team, every single cent that is made in profit at the Revive store or the Mango Way workshop goes back into training Indigenous youth, men and women to give them the opportunity to get off welfare. There is no greater thing than when I meet all the crew up there—and with me last week there were about eight or nine of them—who like nothing better than to get up in the morning, proudly pull on their EKJP shirt, their Wunan shirt or their Revive shirt, and go off and work. Part of that work also gives them the opportunity to use the skills that they are taught in welding and in furniture restoration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say once again to Paige, to Michele Pucci, the CEO of East Kimberley Job Pathways, and to my very dear and close friend Ian Trust from Wunan Foundation: it's the least we can do. I know that when we roll into town we're treated like royalty. You know what? It would be lovely if we had the opportunity—and I know that I've been asked, and other transport companies have now contacted me to say, 'How can we roll this out in other places around Australia?'. So the challenge is there. If anyone wants to kick off and do something really great in remote and rural Australia, I've got the model and we've got the contacts.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to confirm that the Australia and the UK have reached in-principle agreement in relation to this free trade agreement, a free trade agreement that will once again deliver more jobs for Australians and more opportunities for Australian exporters, and bring both our countries closer together in this current strategically-challenging environment. This was an agreement negotiated from scratch in record time, reflecting the close affinity of our two nations and the robust industrial logic of the agreement that is being delivered. This free trade agreement is the right deal for both Australia and the UK, providing each of our nations with greater access to a range of high-quality products, greater access for businesses and workers, and greater access for quality services exchange, driving economic growth and job creation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is significant that the UK turned to Australia to negotiate its first bilateral agreement since leaving the European Union. The UK was already Australia's fifth-largest trading partner in 2019-20, with two-way trade worth $36.7 billion and the second-largest source of investment stock, valued at $738 billion. And, pleasingly, under this agreement, the UK will liberalise Australian imports into the UK, with 99 per cent of Australian goods set to enter the UK duty free. This is good news for our farmers, our businesses and Australian jobs.</span>

Under the coalition, 10 free trade agreements have been concluded, growing the coverage of Australian exports that enjoy preferential access into international export markets from around 26 per cent of exports when we were elected to office to now around 75 per cent of Australia's exports that will enjoy that market advantage in international export markets as a result of these trade agreements. These free trade agreements with our major trading partners—be they the North Asian partners; be they the recently concluded, and entered into force, agreement with Indonesia; be they the multiparty agreements, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership or the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership; or indeed our close partnership with our Pacific island partners—are enhancing opportunities for economic growth across these partners.</span>

All of the research shows that they generate more high-paying Australian jobs and, in doing so, help to create the business and economic strength and resilience to fund the essential services that all Australians rely upon. Australian businesses that export hire, on average, 23 per cent more staff, pay 11 per cent higher wages and have labour productivity 13 per cent higher than non-exporters. Trade of goods and services represented some 40 per cent of Australia's GDP in 2020.</span>

It's not true that we don't have a system to track the vaccination of aged-care workers. We do have a system to track the vaccination of aged-care workers. There's a portal that went live a week and a half ago. It's compulsory, as of yesterday, for aged-care providers to report into that portal. As we advised the Senate committee at estimates a couple of weeks ago, there is a system in place to report worker vaccinations for COVID-19. It has been developed as a part of our realignment of the system of vaccination of aged-care workers. We will continue to report those figures publicly—as we indicated we would, at estimates.</span>

We speak to a lot of providers of technology about doing a number of things. I've had a number of conversations with providers of technology with respect to worker registration, for example, on a number of occasions and with a number of different providers. Some of those providers have subsequently come back to us suggesting that their worker registration process might assist us with some of the other things that we were looking to achieve. We continue to have those discussions, but, of course, we have committed, as part of our royal commission response, to a workforce registration process. We have committed to that, and that will be implemented in conjunction with the sector, but what we haven't done is we haven't gone to any private sector proprietary businesses to take up their particular systems. We're looking to develop a system that provides for registration of the workforce more generally, and one of the features of that workforce registration scheme that we are putting in place could be—<span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's factually incorrect. We're working continuously to support senior Australians to ensure that they have access to vaccines, that the workforce continue to have access to vaccines and that we, importantly, ensure that aged-care residents are vaccinated. As of yesterday, over 94 per cent of aged-care providers had seen two visits of vaccinators to provide the doses, and 100 per cent of aged-care providers had had a first visit. In fact, 147,879 residents have now been vaccinated. So we continue to work in support of the—<span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The G7 said earlier this week that genuine climate action requires countries to stop giving public subsidies to fossil fuels by 2025, and the International Energy Agency has said there should be no new coal, oil or gas projects, to prevent climate disaster. Given this clear message from our international trading partners and experts, why is this government intent on opening up a climate bomb by handing a quarter of a million dollars in public money to allow the Northern Territory Labor government to frack the Beetaloo Basin and opening up acreage that would allow new offshore oil and gas wells near the Twelve Apostles?</span>

First and foremost, the government, the Morrison-McCormack government, is absolutely committed to working with the Australian public to make sure we have an energy mix in this country that is reliable and affordable, but, at the same time, that we meet our international obligations as well as protecting our environment. We actually believe that we can do all of those things at the same time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You refer to a number of projects. As an example, the project offshore in Victoria that you are referring to—clearly we already have independent regulators that have processes in place in which to assess, to make sure, that any project that is undertaken in our amazing Australian environment is protected in the process, but we also have resources that are owned by the Australian people. These resources are for the benefit of all Australians. As long as they are extracted in a mechanism and a manner in which the environment is protected then every Australian deserves to be able to benefit from the benefits of being able to get access to those resources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the case of the Victorian offshore program that you are referring to, of course NOPSEMA is the independent regulator and they will make sure they go through their robust and independent processes to make sure that any exploration, which is what you are referring to, that is undertaken is undertaken in a manner that is consistent with the protection of Australia's environment. We have been very clear as a government that we believe that we have multiple obligations. We have an obligation to the Australian public for cheap, reliable and accessible power, but we also have an obligation to our international requirement on carbon emissions. And we have an obligation to make sure that we protect our environment, our very precious environment, but we will do so in a manner in which we can extract the resources that are the proprietary property of all Australians, and all Australians deserve to benefit from them.</span>

First and foremost there is an absolutely required process, which the government and its instrumentalities have to go through, to make sure appropriate consultation has taken place, to make sure that everybody who has an interest in a particular project has the opportunity to be heard. We are not in any way suggesting that any of those processes are going to be circumnavigated. They will be thoroughly adhered to and gone through. That includes consultation with all of the people who are impacted by any of these developments, including the Beetaloo Basin development that you are referring to in the Northern Territory. The Beetaloo Basin is a very important resource for Australia. I also understand that it is a very important issue for many Australians, and that's why we have robust processes in place to make sure that they are protected, that people's interests are able to be heard and broad consultation will be undertaken to ensure everybody's interests are heard.</span>

Other significant players include Origin, Santos, Jemena and billionaire Gina Rinehart—all donors and friends of the Liberal Party.

It was an historic announcement last night in London between Prime Ministers Morrison and Johnson agreeing to the Australia-UK Free Trade Agreement, which will deliver more Australian jobs and new opportunities for our exporters. It's going to bring greater access to a larger range of products, greater access for businesses and workers, and more opportunities for Australian producers and farmers in the UK market. It is about creating new opportunities and jobs for business by eliminating tariffs on each other's goods and removing the red tape that slows trade down. It is about enhancing pathways for workers and young people to work in both countries, it is about making it easier for our service companies and professionals to do business in each other's markets, and it is about deepening our already very strong investment ties.</span>

We know that free and open trade will continue to drive economic growth as we emerge from the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, so the coalition government is supporting Australian exporters to compete freely, fairly and securely. In fact, in last month's budget, we also announced significant new support to Australian exporters to ensure they can expand and diversify their markets as widely as possible.</span>

Since this government was elected in 2013, the percentage of our trade covered by FTAs has grown from 26 per cent to what will be 75 per cent once the UK FTA takes effect.

The coalition is working to keep global markets open and trade functioning, including through bodies such as the WTO, the G20 and APEC. We support a strong, effective World Trade Organization, which is why both Minister Tehan and I have met this year with the WTO's new Director-General, Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, in Geneva. Australia is working in close partnership with the WTO. We're leading a Cairns Group effort to tackle distorting domestic support in agriculture. We continue to invest in and advocate for WTO reform to ensure a strong system of rules, to secure the rights of Australian exporters, to provide opportunities for our businesses to grow and to create jobs for the future.</span>

The deal will open up such an amazing new set of avenues for our farmers and the broader agricultural sector, because the agriculture sector has always been terribly important for the Australian economy and never more so than it is at the moment as we recover from the COVID pandemic.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This free trade agreement is a very comprehensive agreement. It's high quality and it's mutually beneficial for both of our countries, but, most particularly, for our agricultural sector. It will allow 99 per cent of Australian goods entering the UK to be duty-free, and that includes the immediate elimination of tariffs on wine, which means a lot to the area that I come from, and on rice, which means a lot to the area that you come from, Senator Davey. Beef tariffs will be eliminated over 10 years. Right now we get immediate access to 35,000 tonnes of beef, and that quota will rise to 110,000 tonnes. Sheepmeat tariffs will be eliminated after 10 years as well, which means immediate access to 25,000 tonnes, and that will rise to 75,000 tonnes. Sugar tariffs will be eliminated over eight years and dairy tariffs over five years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This agreement absolutely means that our farmers now have another new and exciting market in which they can sell their amazing, high-quality Australian produce. Not only that, but they will be able to access markets that are actually paying really good prices and understand what the quality of Australian produce is all about. So it has never been more important for Australian farmers to have a diversity of markets which they can access. This new trade agreement is a win for us and it is a win for our country, but it is most particularly a win for our rural economies.</span>

This is fantastic news for the whole of Australia but most particularly for the regional areas that support our agricultural sector. We know our primary producers are absolutely first-class. They're innovative, they're forward thinking and they're always prepared to have a go. This free trade agreement will help them be able to help themselves to support Australia.</span>

The Prime Minister told the G7 summit that Australia will join the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People and that Australia is committed to protecting a combined 30 per cent of domestic land and oceans by 2030. But the goal of the HAC is to protect 30 per cent land plus 30 per cent oceans. Isn't this just more trickery from your government on global commitments, just like wanting to use carryover credits to meet the Paris targets and commitments?</span>

We have had the opportunity in question time to highlight the benefits of the Australia-UK free trade agreement, but that wasn't the only agreement that the Prime Minister signed as part of his work overseas. The Prime Minister made other commitments. Those included hydrogen cooperation commitments with Germany and with Singapore as part of our technology road map and our commitment to engaging with international partners around how it is we drive down emissions in the future through new technologies that Australia can play a leadership role in. We signed an agreement with Japan in relation to decarbonisation.</span>

That includes some $30 million to restore coastal marine ecosystems, particularly those systems such as mangroves, seagrasses and tidal marshes, but it also includes some $40 million to expand the marine park network into the Indian Ocean and protect 45 per cent of Australian waters, as well as to extend to incorporate sea country into Indigenous protected areas across some nine locations, further expanding not only those networks of protected areas but especially Indigenous protected areas. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's all about the cheap grab, the cheap stunt and never about the serious policy work or analysis as to how you achieve the objectives of absolutely protecting Australia's biodiversity, of protecting Australia's wildlife but also enabling business to operate in a commercially competitive way in Australia in a very competitive global landscape. The types of approaches our government seeks to bring, following the very thorough review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, are all about ensuring that we have effective environmental protections in place, that we work in a more harmonised way with the states and territories for the application of those protections but that we don't have a quagmire of bureaucracy that prohibits projects from even getting off the ground, as the Greens seem to prefer.</span>

At the recent round of Senate estimates, less than two weeks ago, we heard that out of the 22,285 people living with disability only 335 had had both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Why were only 1.6 per cent of people living in a residential disability setting fully vaccinated, despite being in priority 1a for the vaccine rollout?</span>

The issue of vaccinations for people with disability, particularly those on the NDIS, their carers and also their support workers has been of great importance to me and a great focus in my first couple of months in this job. We have actually had a significant increase over the last few weeks in the new measures that we have been implementing. We have now got many more hubs, particularly based at providers, and I very much thank the SIL providers in particular for opening up their facilities around the nation and providing vaccinations both for participants and their carers, and also for workers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the last lot of figures that I published, we now have just under 50,000 NDIS participants who have had at least one dose of the vaccine, which is an increase of 18,700 since 25 May. This includes 9,500 people with disability living in residential aged care, or eligible people who are living in disability residential care, under phase 1a of the scheme; that is an increase of over 3,300 since 25 May. We are making significant inroads, and it's due to a fantastic effort between the Department of Health and our department, and now the providers. As I said, I'm very grateful for their assistance in speeding up the rollout.</span>

I would advise all Australians living with disability, their carers, their family members and their workers that there are many avenues now for them to receive vaccinations. The main four channels that everybody, including the family that you have just mentioned—there are now more than 4,600 primary care sites that they can go to. There are the state and territory operated clinics, of which there are now more than 600 across the nation. There are the Commonwealth inreach and hubs, which are being provided through NDIS providers, who are making their facilities available. They in particular have the transportation to assist to bring people in and meet their special requirements, according to their disability. GPs are now doing inreach, and some states pharmacies are now also doing inreach. There are now many channels, and that information is available on the Department of Health's website and also via the NDIA website.</span>

But this vaccination is voluntary. Ultimately, we have now made many more channels available for people with disability, their carers and their support workers to get vaccinated, either within their home or within other facilities they are living in—or they can go to or be transported to many facilities. We have the channels available. We have the means of providing vaccination. But, ultimately, under this scheme, we cannot force anybody to be vaccinated.</span>

I note his home state of South Australia's wonderful leadership in supporting Pacific labour mobility. As we all respond to COVID-19 and look at economic recovery, I want to reiterate that there has never been a more important time for Australia to stand shoulder to shoulder with our partners across the Pacific. The Seasonal Worker Program and the Pacific Labour Scheme have been instrumental in helping to address critical workforce shortages in rural and regional communities. There are now more than 12,000 Pacific and Timorese workers in Australia, with another 27,000 in the work-ready pool. In fact, Pacific labour has been the lifeblood for many Australian businesses and has ensured fresh fruit and vegetables have reached our supermarkets and our tables, and the Australian government values the contribution that Pacific workers have made to our economy. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The COVID-19 pandemic has brought into sharp focus workforce shortages in critical sectors, including agriculture, and highlighted the importance of Pacific labour. Since the restart of COVID-safe recruitment of Pacific workers in September 2020, more than 7,400 Pacific workers have arrived and supported our horticulture and meat-processing sectors, and 2,700 further recruitments are currently being planned. More than 5,000 Pacific and Timorese workers stayed in Australia, working, during COVID. The Australian government is grateful to these thousands of Pacific and Timor-Leste workers for choosing to work in Australia and for helping Australian businesses in our time of need. They're far from home and far from their family, their communities and their 'one talks', and I acknowledge the sacrifice they are making right now. </span>

Last week I, along with my fellow ministers Littleproud and Payne, announced a public consultation process to streamline our Pacific labour mobility initiative. Our commitment is to ensure that Pacific labour mobility is sustainable and efficient into the future and to position Pacific labour mobility for significant future growth. Through this redesign, we'll make it even easier to recruit Pacific workers, to meet current and future workforce shortages, while also continuing to ensure the integrity of the programs and the welfare of workers. Worker welfare is absolutely paramount, and I can't stress this enough. Welfare and program integrity remain at the heart of our enhanced labour programs. But we also know that Pacific labour alone cannot fill the huge seasonal workforce shortages that our farmers and rural industries will experience beyond the pandemic. As we consider how to meet future workforce needs, we will ensure any new arrangements build on and complement the gold standard set by our Pacific labour mobility program.</span>

The remittances sent home by Pacific workers are a key source of family and national income in the Pacific, and these will be even more integral to the pandemic recovery and future growth of Pacific economies. Through the streamlining of the programs, we are committed to growing Pacific labour mobility participation. Our Pacific and Timor-Leste partners should be confident that we remain committed to growing our Pacific labour programs. These initiatives are hugely beneficial for Australian farmers and our Pacific family, and the government is committed to building on their success. We know from the great feedback, from Far North Queensland to Tasmania, that the Pacific will continue to be the priority partners for the Australian government and for Australian farmers for many years to come. </span>

On 11 May this year, this minister was asked about the tragic death of 23-year-old Liam Danher, who died waiting for a seizure mat. The minister first claimed that she had personally been in contact with Liam's father, then she claimed she had offered to meet and had been in touch with Liam's father and then she admitted it was her office who had been in touch with Liam's father. Can the minister now clarify whether she has personally apologised to Liam's family and, if she has done so, when?</span>

As Australians and those on this side of the chamber know, the Morrison government is committed to seeing more Australians in jobs, and that is particularly so for Australian women.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The best way to secure Australian women's economic security is to ensure that the economy is strong and that there are plenty of jobs to go to. At present, there are more Australians in jobs than ever before. There are more Australian jobs than there were before the COVID-19 pandemic began. In March 2021, women's employment in fact hit a record high. The women's workforce participation rate is now hovering around record highs. What's more, the gender pay gap is at record lows, at around 13.4 per cent, which of course is considerably lower than the 17.4 per cent that was observed during the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd Labor government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we're not resting on our laurels; there's certainly more work to do. The Morrison government is particularly focused on policies that generate jobs in emerging industries—industries that require skills in technology, science, engineering and maths, known as STEM. This is particularly so for Australian women, for these are the better and higher-paying jobs of the future. Australia's talent pool is too often limited by the underrepresentation of over half of Australia's population in STEM education and careers. We have such a highly educated workforce and a highly educated female population. In fact, we have the most highly educated female population of any developed country, and yet there is a leaky pipeline and low representation of women in STEM. That's why, in the 2021-22 budget, the Morrison government announced a $42.4 million investment to support women to— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government's rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine for those living with a disability has been woeful—woeful under this minister and woeful under the previous minister. In fact—let's face it—it's almost non-existent. In Senate estimates less than a fortnight ago, it was revealed that—wait for it—355 people out of more than 22,000 people with disabilities living in residential settings had been vaccinated, despite being in the highest priority group, 1a. That's right: 1a. There has been a slight update to that figure, but it's still well below what would be rightly expected in a wealthy, relatively privileged First World country such as ours.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator O'Neill asked in her question, how could Australians living with a disability and their families possibly trust this minister to protect them? The NDIS looks after the welfare of the most vulnerable people in our society, and one of the most serious duties of our type of government is to look after those who are vulnerable. But that will require, of course, the most capable, the most competent and the most composed—which, as we know from Senator Reynolds, is not always the case—of the decision-makers this government can offer. The consequences of the poor leadership which we've seen from this government will be more people dying in their own faeces, more people waiting for a wheelchair and more people who have been approved for plans dying before they can avail themselves of those plans. This is a very, very serious portfolio, and Minister Reynolds, who often has trouble with her recollection, as we've seen quite a lot this year, is probably not the most competent minister to have this portfolio.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There will also be more people left behind by an uncaring bureaucracy. Let's go to the NDIA CEO, Martin Hoffman, who told Senate estimates earlier this year that Liam's death was 'a complicated matter'. That is what he said. Minister Reynolds said, 'I cannot imagine the grief that they are going through.' But what we've heard is that she hasn't understood that grief because she hasn't actually phoned the family, as she claimed she had done earlier in the year. If this scheme were managed properly, Minister Reynolds would not have to imagine the grief of the Danher family and they would not have to go through it, but this scheme is not run competently by this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen the devastating effects of the pandemic and what the virus does when it gets loose in aged-care facilities. We should be doing everything we can to ensure a similar breakout does not happen in the equally vulnerable disabled community. This is basic stuff, but the government continues to shirk its responsibilities, whether they are constitutionally mandated or not. They are much more comfortable outsourcing risk to others, including the states, and then piling on when something goes wrong. Nowhere have they done this more than in my home state of Victoria. During the recent COVID-19 outbreak, the Prime Minister had to be dragged kicking and screaming to help in providing even the most basic support to struggling businesses and workers. This is a Sydney-centric government, and, despite the Treasurer of our nation being a Victorian, the state of Victoria was discarded on the road.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go back to people who are on the scheme. You imagine them in the pandemic, cooped up for long periods inside their homes, terrified of the virus, some of them with conditions that mean they can't deal with being cooped up inside. But there has been the bare minimum of support from this cruel and heartless government. Should we really be surprised? I'm sure the minister, if she had managed to stay, has recovered from losing her previous portfolio and now understands the mess she has to fix, which was left by her predecessor, the member for Fadden. Under his reign of errors, of course, it was revealed that 1,200 Australians with disability had died over three years while waiting to be funded by the scheme. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:09</span>):  The question of vaccinations in this country in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic is, of course, a very, very important series of questions, and today there have been a number of questions on this particular topic. One of the most important things we need to be doing in coming in here at this time is to do everything we possibly can to encourage Australians who are eligible right now to go out, book in a vaccination and get that done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is hesitancy that exists within the community—we all know it; we speak to people in the community about it—and, also, for some, there's a sense of complacency. We're probably a victim of our own success in this country, where COVID, thankfully, has evaded so many of us because of the success of the policies that have been implemented across this country, be it the policies of the Morrison government or indeed those of state governments who have also successfully managed the health pandemic. So for some there is a sense of complacency. But we have a responsibility as political leaders in this country to come into this place, take that responsibility seriously and encourage people, using the influence that we've got, to book in a vaccine and make it happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state I've just recently become eligible to get vaccinated, so I have booked it in. As soon as I get back from this parliamentary fortnight I'm booked in on the Tuesday and I'll be getting my vaccine, my very first dose. My wife works in health care, and she has in fact had her two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. She's a healthcare worker and she took advantage of that as soon as she possibly could. We need to be encouraging more and more Australians to do that. But what we see with those opposite coming in here and asking these questions is an undermining of the confidence that's necessary to encourage Australians to get out there and make it happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, thankfully, we are seeing many Australians taking up the opportunity that's before them to go and get vaccinated. Just to give you a bit of a taste of what we're seeing across the country, it took 45 days for the first million doses to be put in the arms of people across the country. It then took 20 days for the next million doses, to get us to two million people. It then took 17 days for the next million to go through and then it was 13 days. So you can see that the time it's taking is diminishing. It went from 45 days to 20 days to 17 days to 13 days and, in this last 10 days, we've seen another million doses. So we're seeing this rapidly-increasing vaccination program across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, instead of highlighting and getting behind that success, and encouraging an even further embrace of the opportunity to go and get vaccinated, we get questions from those opposite that are guided by some sort of political motivation to undermine the confidence in the system. It's disappointing when you come in here and you see that that's what's going on. We had questions on this today; whereas there actually could have been questions about the efficacy of the vaccine program, how it's impacting and what it's doing. Recently, we saw cases go through Victoria. I heard of one case where a 95-year-old gentleman, sadly, contracted COVID. But, because he had received the vaccine, he actually had no symptoms at all and he got through his case of COVID-19. But, instead of highlighting the impact that this program is having, we get questions that are seeking to actually undermine the confidence in the program, which is indeed very, very disappointing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're seeing Australians stepping up to the plate and doing their bit to take up the vaccine. Despite the great success that there has been across the country and the fact we don't have the prevalence of COVID in our community, Australians know that this is the best way for us to move forward as a nation and to take advantage of all the opportunities that have been created, particularly across the economy. Last night we saw the announcement of the free trade in-principle agreement. There are opportunities that abound for us as a nation, and we need to see Australians take up those opportunities by getting vaccinated. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="AW5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KIM CARR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  It was Gandhi who made the observation that the true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members, and I think this issue that's been identified today in the questions that have been put to Senator Reynolds just highlights our difficulty in this country. We are not treating our most vulnerable in a humane and civilised manner. We are allowing our most vulnerable to be subject to far greater risk and far greater danger than they need be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The media reported today that the government was withholding supplies of vaccines from the states. Victoria's COVID response commander, Jeroen Weimar, said that the state government was grateful that it received an extra 500,000 vaccine doses. Hence, in question time today, the minister repudiated the ABC report. It may be asked, however: how is it that an extra half a million doses can be found so readily if more doses are being produced and imported than are being released? Whatever the accuracy of the media reports, it has become abundantly clear that the Morrison government does not understand how to respond to this pandemic. It's preparing for possible future waves of virus. If it's arguing that case, and it's sitting on a stockpile, that's not the way to go. Increasing the production and distribution of the vaccine is the answer to that, and the government should ensure that that actually happens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It must also ensure that existing stocks are made available to people who actually need them now. No group of Australians needs to be fully vaccinated as soon as possible more than the people with disabilities and those who actually care for them. For the minister to suggest this sort of laissez-faire approach—that it's up to individuals to get it sorted out for themselves—is simply not good enough. Many people with disability have reduced immunity and are extremely vulnerable in such an environment. The government estimates that the number of people who have been fully vaccinated is some 355. That was the position they put to the estimates. That's only 1.6 per cent of people living in residential disability facilities. The government has confirmed that it just doesn't know how many disability workers have been fully vaccinated. In other words, the rollout for disabled people, especially those in residential care, is almost non-existent. To me, that constitutes a national disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission, only in May, rightly called the slow rollout for disabled people an abject failure in the vaccination program. The responsible minister at the time was Minister Littleproud, who said the figures showed that the vaccine rollout was working as it should because there were no COVID infections among people with disabilities. He was boasting about people's good luck. What he didn't say is that not being vaccinated is confining those people to their homes and forcing them to live in what amounts to permanent lockdown. Nearly four million disabled Australians are cooped up in their homes, afraid of what a continuing pandemic will mean for them. Only this government, surely, can pretend that that's an acceptable situation for a country like this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The situation has become so bad that some organisations working in disability care have taken on the role that the government is shirking. For example, Scope Australia has taken the matter into its own hands and is opening up specialist vaccine hubs for people with disabilities. That's admirable, even heroic. But that's the job the federal government should be doing, because only the federal government has the resources to do the job properly. Scope is asking for further clarification from the government as a guide for staff who may be questioning getting the vaccine at all. You have to ask yourself: how has it come to this?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has been reminded many, many times that it has two jobs during this pandemic: one is the rollout and the other is quarantine. It's effectively shifted quarantine onto the states despite its constitutional responsibilities, and it's been dragging its feet in terms of the vaccine rollout itself. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="264449" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHANDLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  In rising to take note of answers from question time today, first and foremost, it is important for all of us in this chamber to remember the unprecedented nature of what we as a country, as a community, as a society, have dealt with over the last 18 months. I think it can be quite easy to forget the quantum of policy response that has been required to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic in a country like Australia, where we have been so fortunate in the way the pandemic has been handled. Remember, it could have been a lot worse than this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eighteen months ago, when COVID-19 first hit, I don't think anyone in this chamber thought that we would be in this position now, where we are rebuilding the economy and where we are developing and administering and rolling out a COVID-19 vaccine. We have to remember that 18 months ago we weren't even sure if a vaccine could be invented in that short a time frame. I can remember speaking to a few experts at the time who said that this sort of thing ordinarily takes decades. We were able to do it, of course with the help of experts around the world, in a matter of months. That is an incredibly impressive thing, and it's something that we have to keep in mind when we think about the way that all levels of government have dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic and the response, and the way the vaccine has been rolled out. We are doing something unprecedented and, quite frankly, completely remarkable in the current situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was having a look at the news during question time. Ordinarily I would be paying attention to all the questions and answers in great detail, but I did have a quick look at one of the newsfeeds and I saw that we ticked over six million doses of the vaccine in the last few hours today. I think that is a really exciting milestone that should be celebrated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I often come in here and happen to do take note with Senator O'Sullivan at the same time. Sometimes it's hard to find something to say after Senator O'Sullivan has made his contribution, because he is so measured and reasoned and has said all there is to say. But I will touch on a few of the points that he made around the importance of the vaccine; I think I have alluded to that already. In hitting those six million doses today, obviously there is still work to be done. There are still phases to be rolled out and there are still people out there who are yet to have a dose of the vaccine. I am one of those people; I am not quite yet anywhere near the front of the queue, I suspect, given my age, but I will be looking forward to having the vaccine when I am able to, at the young age of 31, because it is important that Australians get vaccinated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the vaccine is our best way of keeping safe from this virus and getting life more back to normal as we continue the COVID-19 recovery. I see the vaccine as a really important part of how we deal with this issue not only through a health lens but also through an economic lens. If we can ensure that as much of the population as possible gets vaccinated, then we might have some hope of getting back to living our lives the way we want. If there is one thing that I've heard resoundingly not only from Tasmanians in my local communities but also across the country more broadly in the last 18 months, it is, 'We all want to get back to normal', and I think that is entirely understandable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his contribution Senator O'Sullivan spoke about how rapidly the vaccination program is increasing. Again, this is a really important point. Yes, we started off slowly, but I think that the rapidly increasing rate of vaccination demonstrates that Australians have faith in our vaccine program. I look forward to seeing that vaccination rate continue to increase, because, like I say, getting as many people vaccinated as possible is key to our COVID-19 recovery. It is key to dealing with this health issue on an ongoing basis, and it is key to enabling Australians to get back to living their lives the way they did in a time before COVID-19. It is an incredibly important issue that we have discussed here in the chamber today, and I am so proud of all the efforts that our government is going to in rolling out the vaccine and ensuring that Australia can recover from the COVID-19 economic and health issues.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:24</span>):  If you heard the contributions from those opposite during taking note of answers, you would think there's nothing wrong with the vaccine rollout. I heard Senator O'Sullivan talk about some of the questions from Labor, which we are talking about here, undermining confidence. Well, nothing would undermine the confidence of Australians more than seeing the performance of Minister Reynolds today. Nothing would undermine the confidence of Australians more than seeing the performance of Minister Colbeck over the last couple of months as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, I was not surprised by Minister Reynolds's performance in question time today, because I know Minister Reynolds owes her position to the Prime Minister. I think that Minister Reynolds thinks that, if you just emulate the Prime Minister's performance, that is the ticket to surviving this government. We saw a minister today in answering questions fail to take responsibility and fail to take ownership of being responsible for vaccinating those most vulnerable Australians. We have seen it from the Prime Minister down, time after time, when it comes to important issues confronting the most vulnerable Australians. If you don't take responsibility for vaccinating the most vulnerable Australians then what confidence does that give the Australian people that you're going to get it right? The vaccine rollout is too slow when you compare our performance internationally. That's something that Australians are going to have to confront over coming months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is disappointing that those people who work in disability care have been let down by this government. It's disappointing that those people living with a disability have been let down by this government. And it's disappointing that those Australian families and loved ones who care for a person with a disability are being let down by this government. There's a continual refusal to take responsibility for those people in aged care and those people in disability care, and it does undermine the confidence of the Australian people as a result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the questions that we talked about today from Senator Brown around disability-care workers, what became clear from the answers from Minister Reynolds was there is no central register. Her reason for that is that the workforce is transient. That's exactly the problem. That's where we saw the problem in aged care, particularly in Victoria. It was because people were working between various organisations as a result of the workforce. So it shows you the urgent need for having a central database so you can track who is vaccinated and where they are working as a result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then the minister claimed that the workforce are not required to provide proof of vaccination to their employer. Again, that's another problem that we identified. We saw what went wrong with aged care. You'd think the government would see that and act. Instead, the government saw this and are trying to avoid being responsible for it. They actually ran the other way. Rather than trying to fix these problem, they try to avoid taking any responsibility for them. Minister Reynolds looks at the Prime Minister and thinks: 'He tries to avoid any responsibility. That's the model that I'm going to replicate as a minister.' So there's no duty of care to those people that the minister is responsible for as part of her portfolio.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then in regard to those people in disability residences, again, there was no plan. There was a refusal to commit to a date to have these people vaccinated by. Then the best the minister could do was hope that this was done as quickly as possible. So still we get the rhetoric from the government that this isn't a race. I can assure you that for those people living in disability care and for those people who have loved ones or friends in disability care they want to it be a race. They understand how important this is, particularly when the government don't get the other part of this puzzle right, which is quarantine. The government continue to avoid any responsibility for quarantine as well. So there's no wonder that Australians are frustrated but also concerned about the fact that we could get an outbreak at any second and it could have an impact on aged care or disability care. That's what concerns so many Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're being left behind internationally. The government aren't taking responsibility on these important tasks that they as the federal government have, whether it be vaccinating those people who are vulnerable or whether it be bringing in proper fit-for-purpose quarantine facilities. They continue to thumb their nose at Queenslanders in that regard. It is so disappointing that we have seen this performance from Minister Reynolds today and, again, a failure from this government to take responsibility for what the Australian people have tasked them with.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Birmingham) to a question without notice asked by Senator Hanson-Young today relating to environmental protection commitments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My question earlier today was in relation to the Prime Minister's announcement at the G7 summit some two days ago that Australia would be joining the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People. This coalition of some 60 countries is pledged to protect 30 per cent of the world's domestic land and 30 per cent of the world's oceans. Of course, what we have from this announcement is more trickery and more game playing from this government. While on the one hand they have committed to this 30 per cent by 2030, they are saying it is a combined 30 per cent, together protecting the land and protecting the sea, when of course that is not what this coalition of countries is calling for in the lead-up to the Biodiversity Conference in China in a couple of months time. What it's asking for, of course, is for countries to be fully committed to protecting at least 30 per cent of land plus at least 30 per cent of their oceans from environmental devastation and destruction. Just as we saw this government, time after time, lie, mislead and be tricky over Australia's commitments to reaching the Paris targets by counting Kyoto carryover credits, we again see tricky accounting being used right here under this process. And for what purpose? Is it purely cynical? The government know that the people of Australia want our environment protected, so they say that they're going to do something, while at the very same time they are doing nothing—in fact, going backwards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason I say this is that, while the Prime Minister has been standing up at the G7 saying that Australia commits to protecting our environment, right here in this parliament this week we had the government introducing and pushing through laws that would weaken our environmental protection to pave the way for easier approvals for new mines and big development. You don't have to take my word for it as to what is going on here. The Prime Minister himself declared that this bill, which amends Australia's environment laws, is precisely for the resources sector. It's for keeping the mining companies happy. The Prime Minister has said that himself. It has nothing to do with strengthening our environmental protection laws. It has nothing to do with helping halt the extinction crisis that not only Australia but the world faces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the issue of extinction, Australia, sadly, rates the worst in the world. Can you believe that? Isn't it just shocking that Australia has lost more native species than anywhere else in the world? We're a world leader in extinction, a shameful record and something that we need to start halting and turning around. That is why this coalition of countries is also asking signatories to commit to an extinction target, to halt the destruction of our wildlife and stop the disappearance of our native species. But, of course, the Prime Minister didn't sign up to that particular pledge. The Prime Minister has said one thing at the G7, but here in Canberra, at the very same time, his government is pushing through laws that do nothing to help the environment but do everything to make it easier for big mining corporations and big, greedy developers to keep destroying wildlife habitat and Australia's precious environment. They are saying one thing at the G7 and another thing here in the nation's capital. Australians are sick and tired of the game playing and trickery of this Prime Minister. Here today we've called it out, and the minister, when I asked the question, could not give a simple straight answer.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">MAJOR SPORTING EVENTS (INDICIA AND IMAGES) PROTECTION AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2021</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of the Bill is to protect sponsorship and licensing revenue from the FIFA Women's World Cup Australia New Zealand 2023 and International Cricket Council T20 World Cup 2022 from being undermined by ambush marketing. Ambush marketing is the unauthorised commercial use of event indicia (or expressions) and images. This will be achieved by including the FIFA Women's World Cup and T20 World Cup as recognised major sporting events under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Major Sporting Events (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 2014</span> (the Act).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also removes a schedule relating to a historical sporting event that will no longer provide protections under the Act, being the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Bill makes a minor and technical amendment to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sport Integrity Australia Act 2020 </span>to correct an erroneous reference to an article of the World Anti-Doping Code (Code). The Code's article numbering changed due to revisions that commenced from 1 January 2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill is consistent with the approach the Australian Government took when it legislated to protect the indicia and images for the ICC T20 Women's Cricket World Cup 2020, Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games, AFC Asian Cup 2015 and ICC Cricket World Cup 2015. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It also meets a commitment by the Australian Government to provide such intellectual property rights protection for both the FIFA Women's World Cup and T20 World Cup.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The hosting of these two events in Australia provides a unique opportunity to showcase our country to the world from a tourism, trade and event delivery perspective. It will further strengthen Australia's reputation as a world-class host of major international sporting events, with the Australian Government playing a critical role in facilitating the appropriate environment that makes such success possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The FIFA Women's World Cup will see 32 teams compete across Australia and New Zealand. It will be the first FIFA Women's World Cup to be held in the Asia-Pacific region, and the first ever to be held in the southern hemisphere. The FIFA Women's World Cup teams will include many of the world's most talented female footballers and showcase international football to diverse audiences in Australia and around the world. The FIFA Women's World Cup tournament is scheduled for July – August 2023, with five Australian cities to host match content. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The T20 World Cup will see 16 of the world's best men's teams come to Australia to play T20 cricket, with potential broadcast and digital audiences reaching in excess of 1.5 billion people from more than 200 countries worldwide. These T20 World Cup teams will represent the pinnacle of international sporting competition and include some of the world's most talented male cricketers. The T20 World Cup tournament is scheduled for October-November 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For the owners and organisers of these events, this international profile provides the opportunity to showcase the sports of football and cricket to existing and new audiences, build a legacy and attract commercial partners that will invest in the event and the sports of football and cricket into the future. Event owners and organisers rely heavily on revenue generated by television rights, ticket sales, sponsorship and licensing to ensure their event can be delivered and continues to be an attractive and a viable financial proposition to future host countries. It is this profile and the commercial realities that necessitate the sorts of protections for the FIFA Women's World Cup and T20 World Cup that are in the Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Major events have long been targets of those that would seek to create an impression of association with the event in order to achieve commercial gain without having purchased the rights and therefore invested in the sport, to claim that association. This act, known as 'ambush marketing by association', has the capacity to diminish the value of sponsorship, reduce the incentive for organisations to enter into commercial arrangements with events, and reduce the overall event revenue. In turn, this has the ability to increase the financial impact on government to support such events.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will protect the use of a range of expressions associated with the FIFA Women's World Cup and T20 World Cup from ambush marketing and unlicensed commercial use in the lead up to, during and in the immediate aftermath of each tournament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to protecting specific event-related terminology, the Bill also provides protection to certain images that in the circumstances of their presentation suggest, or are likely to suggest, a connection with the FIFA Women's World Cup and T20 World Cup. These images may be either visual or aural representations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While it is important to protect tournament sponsors from ambush marketing, the rights of the community to freedom of expression must also be respected, particularly in relation to words that have passed into common usage. A pragmatic approach has been taken with generic words and references excluded from the list of protected expressions. It must also be emphasised that restrictions on the usage of FIFA Women's World Cup and T20 World Cup indicia and images will apply only to their unlicensed commercial use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A number of exceptions will exist in relation to the FIFA Women's World Cup and T20 World Cup allowing for:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In introducing this bill, I want to talk about the work of the Senate Select Committee on Electric Vehicles, of which I was a member. That inquiry received 137 submissions. It held five public hearings across four states, between August and October of 2018. In January of 2019, the Select Committee's report, when it was finalised, was almost two hundred pages long. So far, we have not received a response to that report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">One of the key recommendations from that report - in fact, the first recommendation - was that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">… the Australian Government develop a national EV strategy to facilitate and accelerate EV uptake and ensure Australia takes advantage of the opportunities, and manages the risks and challenges, of the transition to EVs. Addressing these risks and challenges will require effective national standards and regulation in regards to charging infrastructure and electricity grid integration, building and construction, public safety, consumer protection, processes for disposal and/or re-use of batteries, and skills training.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In April 2019, the Liberal party promised a National Electric Vehicle Strategy, although they only allocated a measly $400,000 towards developing it. But it was only a month or two later, in the 2019 election, that for short-term political gain, the Prime Minister decided to attack electric vehicles, making the ludicrous claim that they would 'end the weekend'. Of course, once the election was over, the Department was forced to admit they couldn't substantiate those claims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But it's now 2021, and despite the time passing, we still have no national electric vehicle strategy. In the exceptionally weak consultation paper released in February of this year, there was no commitment to consumer incentives, a crucial part of the puzzle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The complete failure by the Commonwealth Government has left a massive policy gap. In that gap, we've seen a range of state government approaches, often tragically misguided. The Australian Capital Territory, commendably, is one of the few with a clear strategy and incentives, and we welcome the steps the ACT Greens have achieved in that government, including free registration for electric vehicles, to encourage their uptake.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Sadly, many of the other state and territory governments are going in the wrong direction. The Victorian Government has introduced an unfair tax on electric vehicles, that will not apply to vehicles with internal combustion engines. That tax will directly reduce the uptake of electric vehicles, at exactly the moment when we need more of them. As we noted in our dissenting report on the COAG Reform Fund Amendment (No Electric Vehicle Taxes) Bill 2020:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">Despite subsequently committing to a national EV strategy, the Commonwealth Liberal government has comprehensively undermined action on EVs, including attacks during the 2019 election that were subsequently shown to be unsupported.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />
                    <span style="font-style:italic;"> In the absence of the needed Commonwealth leadership, state governments have taken steps to introduce additional taxes on EV, that would further hinder the uptake of EVs, and slow the urgent action we need on emissions to address the climate crisis.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The simple reality is that Australia is being left behind by other countries. Many countries have introduced clear, urgent phase out dates for new internal combustion engines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Manufacturers around the world are shifting rapidly to electric vehicle production. Without urgent action, led by the Federal Government, we risk becoming a dumping ground for the cars that other governments will not accept. As economist John Quiggin summarised:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">Unless the government takes action soon, Australian motorists will be faced with the choice between a limited range of second-rate petrol and diesel vehicles, or electric vehicles for which key infrastructure is missing.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the same time as we see this complete failure by the Liberal party at a national level, they are desperate to prop up dying fossil fuel sectors. That includes providing a $2 billion subsidy to fuel refineries, ostensibly for fuel security, whilst they comprehensively ignore the value for fuel security that electric vehicles have. Sadly, that pattern is all too reflective of the approach of the Liberal party. As Australian Greens Leader Adam Bandt said in relation to the 2020-21 Budget:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">One in three big corporations in this country pays no tax, and billionaires increased their wealth by a third during the pandemic, but this budget fails to make billionaires and big corporations pay their fair share, grows inequality and fast-tracks the climate crisis.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the middle of a climate crisis, this budget finds $11.4 billion for fossil fuels this year alone and another $1.1 billion for new coal and gas projects, but nothing, for example, for electrifying transport, a sector responsible for 16 per cent of our emissions. This budget is champagne for the billionaires and real pain for everybody else. In fact, this budget is based on real wages going backwards for two years. It's tax cuts for the billionaires and handouts for big corporations but wage cuts for workers and poverty for the unemployed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the midst of this inaction by the Liberal Party on electric vehicles, and subsidies for fossil fuel refineries, this Bill is a very reasonable, measured approach. It simply requires the Government to provide a regular statement, outlining their approach to electric vehicles. It would also require a report by the Productivity Commission on how Australia's approach compares with the rest of the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We know Australia has been left behind, due to the Liberal party's inaction. But rather than obfuscation, ducking and weaving, and avoiding accountability, this Bill would simply require them to be upfront with Australians about what they're doing - or failing to - and how far we're lagging behind the rest of the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a>  Ambition is important, but action and outcomes are ultimately what matter. Between 2005 and 2019 Australia reduced emissions faster than Canada, Japan, New Zealand and the US, faster than both the G20 average and the OECD average. We have the most solar per person of any country in the world, the highest rate of household solar in the world and the most wind and solar per person of any country outside of Europe. The Morrison government is committed to reducing our emissions in a way that preserves Australia's strengths by protecting our regional communities, our resources industry and our heavy industry. The government's practical, technology-driven approach is reducing emissions without imposing new costs on households, businesses or the economy.</span>

                  </a>  One Nation opposes this motion. Under my cross-examination during its presentation CSIRO has admitted it has never said carbon dioxide from human activity is a danger. CSIRO later admitted that today's temperatures are not unprecedented. CSIRO then cited references that proved that the rate of temperature increase is not unprecedented. Former Obama science advisor Steve Coonan recently admitted, 'The warmest temperatures in the US have not risen in the past 50 years.' For more than 10 years the current Greens Senate leader has refused to debate the empirical data and refused to debate the corruption of climate science on which the Greens' call is based. There is no empirical scientific evidence for decarbonising and deindustrialising our nation, yet Greens leader Adam Bandt supports European Union tariffs and Korean levies for supposed climate inaction. Without evidence, the Greens' nightmare call on the government would hurt the poor, hurt our natural environment, hurt jobs and gut our economy.</span>

Is there a contingent notice to this effect? There isn't? Senator Waters, you have the right to speak to the motion.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WATERS:</span>
                  </a>  I want to outline to anyone listening—and certainly there will be many survivors of sexual assault who have in fact been listening to what's just occurred—that, as folk know, there are unresolved rape allegations against Minister Porter, who's no longer the Attorney-General but remains a minister. The police have not been able to investigate. The Prime Minister has not seen fit to investigate. The Prime Minister asked his mate Mr Porter if there was any truth to the allegations and accepted Mr Porter's word for it. The Prime Minister did not read the dossier of allegations from the victim, which was provided to him. He has simply accepted his mate's version of the story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since there is no other avenue to ascertain the truth of what occurred, and since the Prime Minister refuses to call his own inquiry into the fitness of the people he has appointed to be cabinet ministers, I was attempting to introduce a bill. I got so far as to introduce a bill for a commission of inquiry to ascertain whether Christian Porter is fit to remain a cabinet minister, making decisions for the benefit of all Australians. In a virtually unprecedented move, this government blocked that bill from being read a first time. They have stopped the bill in its tracks. They just then denied me leave to even table the explanatory memorandum and second reading speech. This is a government that cannot handle transparency of any sort.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've now sought leave to introduce the bill a second time, and, once again, the government has denied me leave to do so. This is a government that thrives on secrecy. We all knew this, but this is a new low: to stop a senator from introducing a bill for a matter of transparency that goes to the functioning of this democracy is an absolute outrage. It is an outrage to process and democracy; more so, it is an outrage to survivors of sexual assault everywhere. Earlier in the year, 90,000 people signed a petition and marched on this parliament. The Prime Minister didn't want to talk them then, either, but they signed a petition saying, 'We need an inquiry into Minister Porter's fitness to be a minister of the Crown.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of Kate's friends have been rallying around this issue, and, in fact, Jo Dyer is sitting in the chamber with us now, witnessing this. She was ready to witness the introduction of a bill. Instead, she has witnessed this government blocking the bill from going forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just when you think this government can't sink to new lows, it manages to find a way every single time. They have just stopped a bill from proceeding. I can only think of two other occasions in my 10 years of being in this place that that has happened. It may well have happened on the very odd occasion prior to that time, but it is highly unusual to stop senators introducing bills, particularly bills about process and about making sure that this democracy can function properly, that members of the Australian community can have confidence in the institutions of government and that rape survivors everywhere can feel emboldened to share their stories and seek justice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government should be utterly ashamed of themselves, and I want to know who gave the authority to shut this bill down. I want to know if it was just the folks sitting over there or if it was the Prime Minister who issued a decree saying: 'This bill will not proceed. My mate Christian Porter has to stay in the cabinet because he assured me he's innocent, and that's all I need to know.' I want to know who gave the order to shut this bill down. The Australian people deserve to know. Why have you shut this bill down? What is your reasoning? What are you going to do, if not this commission of inquiry, to make sure that justice is served in this case? Will you just have anyone on your cabinet benches? Do those prime ministerial statements of ministerial standards not mean anything? We thought as much, but you've just proved it today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an outrage. Women across the country, decent people across the country, will be horrified that this government is once again shutting down this semblance of a measure of seeking justice. This is nothing but a protection racket for the boys club that is this government and this cabinet. I urge you to reconsider. I'm not going to let this drop. The 90,000 people who signed that petition are not going to let this drop. Fifty-one per cent of the population are not going to let this drop. By all means go to the election with this as your position. I look forward to you being condemned to the dustbin of history and the opposition benches for many years to come. But women deserve better. This country deserves better. Shame on you.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  I'll call Senator Ruston next, but I'll ask Senator Waters a question, because I want to clarify. You are seeking to suspend standing orders to give notice. Is it for reintroducing the same bill, or is it a different bill?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="252157" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WALSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  The Morrison government have failed Victorians—they have failed! They've had months to prepare Australia to deal safely with the ongoing impact of the pandemic. They've had months to roll out the vaccine effectively and they've had months to get safe, national open-air quarantine facilities up and running. And have they? No. Throughout this pandemic, the Morrison government have denied their responsibility for quarantine. They have failed to set appropriate national standards for quarantine. And all the while, they have sat back and critiqued state government responses to breaches in hotel quarantine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Morrison said about hotel quarantine back in April:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A system that is achieving 99.99 per cent effectiveness is a very strong system and is serving Australia very well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How did he come to that conclusion and that figure? There have been 21 breaches from hotel quarantine in this country, tens of thousands of infections in this country and more than 800 tragic deaths in this country. Does that sound like a system that is serving Australia well? It sounds like a system that's struggling dangerously to keep up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When will the Morrison government get it? Hotels are built for tourists and for short stays. Hotels are not built for virus control. This government was told in October by their own hand-picked adviser Jane Halton that they needed to build fit-for-purpose, open-air quarantine facilities. That was seven months ago. The Victorian government handed them a proposal for a new purpose-built quarantine facility back in April. When did Prime Minister Morrison finally agree to build a facility in Victoria? In June, when Victorians were already battling with new outbreaks from more failures of the hotel quarantine system—this time from Adelaide. This government just does not think ahead. They don't plan, and when they are finally dragged, kicking and screaming, to act, it's already too late.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to this Prime Minister, the vaccine rollout is not a race and mRNA vaccine manufacturing starting in four years time is fine. Purpose-built quarantine facilities can wait and the states are just welcome to give the government their proposals. Financial support for casual workers who are in crisis in Victoria? They can wait too. They can wait for a week without pay: 'You'll have to drag us, kicking and screaming, to deliver it.' And according to the Acting Prime Minister, a week without income is not that long to wait anyway. What a heartless response from this government!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government should be embarrassed and ashamed at the pace of the vaccine rollout in Australia—embarrassed and ashamed! Victorians entered 2021 expecting a fast and efficient vaccine strategy, only to be given the exact opposite by the Morrison government. I was there, with all Victorians, going through the winter with the virus spreading throughout our community last year. One of the things that got us through was the hope of a vaccine on the other side and the hope of effective national quarantine. That's what got us through last year. But here we are again, facing yet another Victorian winter with the virus again trying its best to spread through an almost-entirely unvaccinated population. Today, less than three per cent of Australians are fully vaccinated—less than three per cent! Let that sink in. And we're currently 4.2 million doses behind the government's current vaccination target. It's not their first target and not their second target; it's behind their third target. They just keep dropping the bar lower and lower, and still they're missing the mark. They still can't tell us how many aged-care workers have been vaccinated. They still can't tell us when aged-care workers will be vaccinated. The health minister, Mr Hunt, is not even sure whether he wants us to be vaccinated. One day he's telling over-50s to get AstraZeneca; the next he's saying they can wait until the end of the year for Pfizer. Which is it? You could not make this stuff up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians and especially Victorians had to dig deep to get through last year. Victorians sacrificed so much to beat this virus back, and they should have been able to come into 2021 with confidence that this government had learned the lessons of 2020 and had a real plan to ensure that Australians would be able to beat this virus and be safe; that people wouldn't be sitting ducks, waiting for the next outbreak to hit; that we would be vaccinated; and that quarantine would be safe. But the Morrison government has failed Victorians, because it is impossible for a federal government to deal with the pandemic if they don't actually believe in governing. It is impossible for a federal government to deal with the pandemic if they don't want to roll up their sleeves and if they wait, time and again, to be dragged kicking and screaming to do anything—to do something. It doesn't work. The Morrison government's approach doesn't work. They have left Victorians exposed. They have left Australians exposed. It doesn't have to be this way. If only the government believed in actually governing! If only they believed in taking responsibility! If only they would act instead of just react!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a race, and it isn't a case of slow and steady wins the race. So it is time for this government to pick up the pace, to get moving, to get on with the job of building fit-for-purpose quarantine facilities in every state and territory, to start a public health campaign and to ramp up the vaccine rollout with some urgency. There is no room for more excuses from this government. The Prime Minister needs to step up and do his job, because lives depend on it. Until this government does step up, all of the hard work that Australians put in last year and this year to get our country moving again, is just waiting to be thrown away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor knows that, if we are to beat this virus and keep Australians safe, there can be no more delays. Labor would build dedicated quarantine facilities in every single state and territory. We would fix this bungled vaccine rollout. We would start a mass public health campaign around vaccines. Where is the public health campaign around vaccines? We would make it a first priority to manufacture more vaccines right here in Australia. It's the only path forward towards a real recovery that leaves Australians secure in getting on with their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But all of this, apparently, just seems like too much work for the Morrison government. They would rather sit back and be reactive instead of proactive and to deal with it once the damage is already done. They 'don't hold a hose'. They don't take responsibility. They don't admit fault. They should feel real shame about what Victorians have been going through for the last few weeks. They should look at the evidence and see what their repeated failure has done. Their inability to take responsibility, actually run this country and take us through the pandemic is hurting Victorians and other Australians. Real people are impacted by this government's weakness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no longer day 1 of the pandemic. It's been over 500 days since the first COVID case in Australia. The Prime Minister cannot pretend that he doesn't know how this virus moves, how infectious it is and how devastating it can be. He needs to wake up and be honest with Australians. He needs to realise how big a mistake it is every day that we miss the vaccination mark and every day that we wait for fit-for-purpose open-air quarantine. Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his government might be prepared for Australians to make the sacrifice again and again for the Morrison government's failures, but Australians are done. We are done. We want the Morrison government to do the job that they were elected for: to stand up for Australians and protect Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="ZN4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HENDERSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:44</span>):  It's my pleasure to rise and speak in this matter of public importance debate about the need to apologise to all Victorians. I have to say I am incredibly disappointed to hear Senator Walsh's contribution, about which I can only say was highly irresponsible. To misrepresent, in particular, the advice of the federal health minister in relation to the vaccination is a disgrace, and that's what Senator Walsh has just done. We all have a responsibility in this chamber, no matter which side of politics we are on, to make sure that Australians have accurate information. For Senator Walsh to get up with that ridiculous spray and say what she did, she should be totally ashamed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an MPI about the requirements of an apology. Yes, an apology is required, and Victorians have worked it out: an apology is required by the Victorian state government and by federal Labor Victorian MPs and senators, who have stood in silence through four lockdowns as Victorian residents, including Victorian families, businesses, seniors and students, have been brought to their knees as a result of the mismanagement of the pandemic in Victoria by the state Labor government. The fact that Victoria has suffered four debilitating lockdowns, unlike what we have seen in any other state or territory, is no coincidence. To Labor senators in this chamber I say please perhaps consider apologising to Victorians for the hotel quarantine fiasco, including the engagement of security guards who had no proper infection control training or expertise which allowed coronavirus to spread into the community, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of senior Victorians. That was the finding of the COAT inquiry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They should apologise to Victorians for not accepting the offer of help from the Commonwealth, such as the provision of ADF personnel to support the state's quarantine responsibilities. They should apologise to Melburnians for the curfew, which effectively locked them in their homes and which was, without doubt, in breach of the Victorian government's charter of human rights. They should apologise to the people who lived in the public housing towers in Melbourne, who were locked down with no warning whatsoever, leaving parents without food for their children and older residents frightened, which the Victorian ombudsman found was a clear breach of human rights. They should apologise for the Victorian state government's incompetent contact tracing system. There have been some big improvements, and I'm pleased to say that, but it's still a far cry from the gold standard in New South Wales, and it meant that for many months the government ignored the advice of the experts to adopt a unified QR code and check-in system, to adopt proper IT systems and to publish exposure sites so that people could immediately, if they'd visited those sites, isolate and get tested. Perhaps they should also consider apologising to school students for missing so many weeks of school and to families for not being able to see their loved ones. Even now families in regional Victoria can't visit their loved ones in residential aged care unless they are at end of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say: apologise to Victorians for four state-wide lockdowns, including the most recent lockdown in regional Victoria, where there has been no community transmission. They have resulted in insurmountable financial and mental health pain and left so many businesses broke and/or closed when there was no basis to do so, including the IGA supermarket in Anglesea, which was forced to close as a result of a false positive case and which has now suffered losses in excess of $100,000. Perhaps also they should apologise to our regional tourism and hospitality sector and to regional chambers of commerce and to regional committees, including the Committee for Mornington Peninsula, which are pleading for the state government to put in place a proper COVID-safe response plan so that whenever a positive case arises it can be dealt with locally whilst allowing the rest of the city and the state to function, as happens in New South Wales. The facts are that this latest lockdown has caused a loss of faith and confidence, because it demonstrates that the Victorian government still doesn't have the capacity to control the virus and the outbreaks locally in any sort of proportionate manner as occurs in other states.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last weekend, the long weekend, the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry estimated that lost visitation and cancelled trips cost regional Victorian businesses and the visitor economy around $150 million just over three days. And that, of course, was due to unreasonable density caps. Major tourism businesses, such as Sovereign Hill, could not open and many major businesses were closed, such as Heathcote on Show and the Castlemaine Jazz Festival. Wineries, restaurants, hotels, cafes, accommodation providers and other tourist operators were left high and dry. It is time that the state government worked out how to keep our state's economy open whilst protecting lives and livelihoods. None of these issues were addressed by Senator Walsh in her contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to move now to the facts in relation to the Commonwealth's quarantine responsibilities. They are very clear. Again, these are facts not acknowledged or even referenced in Senator Walsh's contribution. Mandatory quarantine with COVID-19 testing is currently considered the best strategy for incoming travellers and it is a key pillar of our nation's response. Hotel quarantine was mandated by national cabinet on 27 March 2020. These requirements have been implemented under state and territory legislation with the support of the ADF and the Australian Border Force, where necessary. Since the implementation of hotel quarantine there have been 372,000 international air arrivals, with some 4,000 COVID-positive cases—most of which have been in hotel quarantine. Apart from the major failures which occurred in Victoria there have been very few other outbreaks.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In accordance with the resolution of national cabinet, the Commonwealth is supporting the states and territories. It's supporting Northern Territory at the Howard Springs quarantine facility. The investment is in excess of half a billion dollars and that is also supporting our national effort to repatriate Australians flying in to Australia. That is a major incoming port for all Australians. There is the agreement with Tasmania to support Australians returning there. Then there is the memorandum of understanding for a quarantine facility in Victoria, and I welcome that. It is a pity, though—again, Senator Walsh did not reference this—that the state Labor government has proposed an animal quarantine facility at Mickleham as its preferred option. From where I sit, as a regional senator based in Geelong, that is absurd because that presents a whole range of biosecurity and logistical issues which the state government have not even considered. That's why I have been such a big supporter of placing this quarantine facility at Avalon Airport, where incoming travellers can fly directly into Avalon—to an international terminal, a first-class terminal—and then travel a very short distance to their accommodation facility. Even on this issue it does not seem that the Victorian government has done its basic homework.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do welcome the fact that the Victorian government is open to Avalon. I'm very confident, and I hope, that that will be the decision as negotiations continue between the Commonwealth and the state. This makes great sense for Victoria. It makes great sense for the Geelong region. It would be a huge boost for jobs in our local economy and would utilise Avalon Airport, which has endured such financial pain over the last 18 months or so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to Labor senators: there's a lot to apologise for in relation to what has happened in Victoria. It has been a very torrid time and, as I say, it's no coincidence that there have been these rolling lockdowns in Victoria—unlike in any other state. I am really proud of the Morrison government's management of this pandemic. To a large degree the Morrison government has worked very successfully with the states and territories. Just think of this: more than 12 months ago it was hard to envisage that we would have a vaccination. That vaccination rollout is happening at a very, very fast pace. We are at total vaccinations of almost six million. That is a great achievement. Yes, there is more hard work to be done. We urge all Australians to get vaccinated. We can be very proud of our efforts together. I say to the state government in Victoria: please get your act together in relation to the issues for which you are responsible, and I hope and trust that the new quarantine facility in Victoria will be at the wonderful Avalon Airport.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  I rise to speak to this matter of public interest on the need for the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services to apologise to Victorians for claiming 'a very positive record across the board with respect to maintaining a safe border for Australia' at the same time as Victoria faced new COVID outbreaks because of the Morrison government's failure to implement and maintain safe national quarantine. The reason that the minister has to apologise for this is for the comments that have been made. These comments about the fact that they have a very positive record have been repeated a number of times. How can you call it a 'positive record' when, during estimates, a document was tabled that documented 21 quarantine breaches? That document didn't include another breach that has happened since then nor the quarantine breach happening right now in New South Wales. People may say, 'It's just 23 breaches'—and the government has been saying that thousands of people have been coming into Australia—but the point is: look at the impact that one breach had on Victoria just recently. It wasn't even an escape from a Victorian hotel. It came through a South Australian quarantine breach and caused the current outbreak in Victoria which led to the lockdowns. I notice today that the restrictions are being wound back again, thank goodness, for Victorians. But the fact is that one breach has a very, very significant impact, and the Commonwealth knows this. So how can they say, 'We have a very positive record,' when in fact there have been a number of breaches? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know hotels are not the right place for quarantining people. Fair enough, when the pandemic first hit, we had to take immediate action and hotels were then brought into play. It was important that that happened, but we are now a significant period down the track. We are now having breaches from quarantine, which are causing lockdowns. Western Australia has had several, Victoria has had a number, South Australia has too, obviously, and so have New South Wales and Queensland. That is why we need specialist facilities for quarantining like Howard Springs. There have been no breaches of quarantine from Howard Springs. That's because it has what is necessary to ensure effective quarantining—people in their own space and able to get fresh air. There have been none of the issues around ventilation and aerosols that we're seeing in hotels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government, again in estimates, said, 'We're paying attention to aerosols,' the problem with aerosols has been there since the beginning. Yes, they mouth the words, but do they do something about it? No. There's been a problem with getting out effective PPE that deals with aerosols, but, specifically, the ventilation in hotels for quarantining in a lot of those hotels is not adequate. They've known that for a long time too, but do we have guidelines across Australia on ventilation and aerosols? Guess what? No, we don't. While I mistakenly believed, from an answer to one of my questions in the Senate Select Committee on COVID-19, that, yes, they are developing some guidelines around that across the nation, in estimates the answer to my question, 'How are they proceeding,' was, 'No, we're not actually working on them.' So we still have no national guidelines on ventilation ensuring negative pressure in these hotels. While states have moved to try and address this issue, it is still happening. This clearly means the Commonwealth needs to take action to build special-purpose, fit-for-purpose quarantine facilities, because we are going to be dealing with this issue for a significant time into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That takes me to the issue of the need for vaccines. Of course, we are very pleased to see that vaccines have been developed with a lot of effort around the world, but for the government to claim that they are way up there in the rollout of vaccines is ridiculous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the number of targets and the number of assurances by the government that we've had: at the beginning of March the government missed the target. At the end the March they missed the target. In April they missed the target. In January the government announced there would be 40 million total doses by the end of October this year. They've already admitted they're not going to meet that. We have seen the 40-million-doses target revised a number of times. We have clearly missed the mark on vaccinations, specifically in aged care for residents but particularly for staff. In disability, shared accommodation and group homes, we again have missed the mark for residents and disabled people and their carers. In aged care in particular, we still don't know how many workers have been vaccinated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have contracted this out. When the first contractor didn't deliver, what did they do? 'Oh yes, we went to another contractor to try and fix the first contractor's failure to roll out the doses to meet our targets.' This has been, in many instances, in fact, farcical—the number of contracts, the amount of money we have paid—instead of making sure that the Public Service could do it, that the government could do it or that the states and territories could do it. The reason so many doses have now been rolled out is the states and territories have picked up the slack and set up hubs. They're the ones doing it. So, yes, the minister does owe Victorians an apology for continuing the myth that the government is doing safe border management when we've had so many breaches that have had such devastating consequences.</span>

                  <a href="e5x" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  I want to make a few comments in relation to this MPI. To start with, I think we have to correct the record. When Senator Henderson, who is typically keeping her head in the sand, comes in here and tries to rewrite what's really happening in this country, saying: 'This is all Victorians' fault. The whole pandemic rests with the Victorian state Labor government'—well, what a lot of nonsense. Then she goes on with some more diatribe, trying to tell us that there is a fast rollout of the vaccine. We know quite clearly that that is not the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two facts that we should put on the record which make very clear what is happening in this country and why it is happening. Firstly, it's the Commonwealth government's responsibility to roll out the vaccine. It is the Commonwealth government's responsibility to provide quarantine. They have failed in their duty of care on both counts. As Senator Siewert just spoke about in her contribution, there have been 23 breaches of hotel quarantine in a number of states, including New South Wales, Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria. We haven't seen any leadership from this government when it comes to ensuring that there is an efficient, fast rollout of the vaccine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have known for some time in this place, because we have evidence of it every time we sit in this chamber, that we have an incompetent minister in Senator Colbeck when it comes to his responsibilities around aged care. We saw the Prime Minister remove a lot of his responsibilities and hand them over to Minister Hunt—we've seen how well that has worked!—and I'm sure he sees Senator Colbeck as a dispensable commodity in this place. If the Prime Minister really believed it when he said that he was going to make aged care, aged-care workers and older Australians a priority of his government in rolling out the vaccine, then he would never have left Senator Colbeck in charge. Senator Colbeck has been an embarrassment to this government, and I know that Australians generally have no faith in him as a minister when it comes to aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Henderson—who is a Victorian, by the way—denies that there needs to be an apology to the Victorian people. It almost leaves me speechless that she could come into this place and try and shift the blame—like the Prime Minister and all the ministers do—and say that the whole problem around the pandemic rests with the Victorian Labor government. Well, it does not. The buck stops with the Prime Minister and his government when it is a matter of rolling out the vaccine and when it comes to quarantine in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have the utmost respect for Jane Halton, a former secretary of the Department of Health. The Prime Minister's own captain's pick has made numerous comments and recommendations in relation to quarantine and what is needed in this country, and yet we still see the government ignoring that advice. Senator Henderson said in her contribution that the vaccine is being rolled out at a fast rate. Why is it then that less than three per cent of the Australian population has been fully vaccinated? Heavens! I would hate to see what it would be like if it was being rolled out at a slow pace!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is really frustrating for people who have relatives, friends and loved ones in residential aged care, because what we have seen is neglect by this government—and, in particular, by Senator Colbeck in his responsibility around aged care. They have not only failed to ensure that the residents in these aged-care residential homes have been fully vaccinated—and we know that they all haven't been—but also failed in their duty to ensure that aged-care workers have had the opportunity to be fully vaccinated. And the government still don't know how many workers have in fact been vaccinated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, even worse than that, knowing that we are still in this pandemic and that the virus is mutating around the world, and we have various different versions now in Australia, the government took away the supplement that was being paid to aged-care workers in this country to ensure that they were not being forced to go and work across a number of sites. We all know that they are so lowly paid, and what did this government do? They stopped the supplement, and yet the pandemic is still going. How irresponsible is that? Where is the leadership? Where is the strategy for ensuring that we get ahead of the game when it comes to rolling out the vaccines and getting ahead of this pandemic? They don't have one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no way that anyone, including Senator Henderson, can come into this chamber and try and spin it, because we know that they have failed in their basic duty of care to older residents in this country. We know that, in the case of those older Australians in residential care who died, the virus was taken into those homes through workers. But what has the government done to remedy that situation? They have taken away the supplement and they have not ensured, to the degree that they should, that aged-care workers have been vaccinated. We believe that some nine per cent of the workforce have been vaccinated. There are over 360,000 people working in aged care. So nine per cent is not very many of them. It isn't good enough. Quite frankly, people on that side of the chamber should be quite ashamed of their government's contribution when it comes to ensuring that Australians, and particularly older Australians and their carers, have been vaccinated—and we're not yet talking about people with disability and their carers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as is always the case, the government are so arrogant. They think they can just spin their way out of any situation. I have been following politics since I was a young student in high school, and I have never known of a prime minister who would let the lies just slip off his lips as easily as this Prime Minister does on a daily basis. The really sad thing is that I think he believes his own lies. I really do. He believes his own lies. He is now being seen for the deceptive, very shonky Prime Minister that he is. Quite frankly, the Australian people deserve so much—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite frankly, the minister does owe the Victorian community an apology. Certainly, the Prime Minister owes Victorians an apology. The Prime Minister and other members of the government have been saying there is not a race to roll out the vaccine. Well, quite frankly, this is a race that we need to win. We need to get ahead of this virus. It is mutating to the extent that we don't know if there are any bounds to this. Therefore, we should be ensuring that the most vulnerable members of our community—whether they're older Australians, whether they're people with disability or whether they're the people who are on the frontline—have access as quickly as possible to ensure that we get ahead of this virus. But the government continually blame the states because they never want to accept any responsibility. The Prime Minister is being known as the Prime Minister who never takes responsibility. He is a Prime Minister who can't be trusted.</span>

The facts are that we face a global pandemic and, in about March last year, the Prime Minister rightly called all leaders in this country—himself as Prime Minister of the nation and every single one of our premiers and chief ministers—to discuss seriously as one nation how we were going to deal with a global pandemic the likes of which we had not seen since the Spanish flu. It was in that national cabinet that Premier McGowan, the Labor Premier from WA, Premier Palaszczuk, the Labor Premier from Queensland, Chief Minister Barr, the Labor Chief Minister from the ACT, Chief Minister Gunner, the Labor Chief Minister from the NT and Premier Daniel Andrews, the Premier of 'Danistan', as we now know him, all agreed—</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. So, coming, as I do, from Danistan: all of those Labor premiers and chief ministers agreed in March that they would take responsibility for quarantine and we would take responsibility for other aspects of dealing, as a nation, with a global pandemic. Premier McGowan has been tough on the borders, but you know what? He doesn't hold a candle to Daniel Andrews's failures. Premier Palaszczuk—at least you can contact trace in Queensland. In Victoria, they cannot contact-trace a zebra crossing Collins Street, after 18 months. So, if you want to talk about where the failures in our system are in this country, I lay them firmly at the feet of the ministers who've failed—from health ministers right up to the premier—in my home state of Victoria, who, 18 months after the fact, have only one trick in their back pocket on how to deal with outbreaks in my home state, and that is to lock everybody down—everyone, put your masks back on; you can't leave home; you can't get married; you can't bury your loved ones; you can't get elective surgery done; you can't open your business. Of the latest lockdown, the first seven days cost regional Victoria $150 million. It just sounds like a number to people who don't care about small businesses, but these are people who've put their mortgages on the line to run these businesses and have absolutely no certainty. And you know how confident people are in Danistan about our state government's ability to manage the COVID-19—</span>

It has been like living in a gulag living in Victoria for the last 18 months, where at any given moment, because this guy cannot contact-trace, because he's got a bureaucracy that's doing its best but doesn't have the systems in place, the state can be locked down at a moment's notice in such a draconian way. This isn't about Labor versus Liberal, because I praise the Chief Minister of the ACT, Chief Minister Barr, for having recognised that regional Victorians didn't carry the same COVID risk that someone from Melbourne might have in an earlier breakout, so he sensibly applied a definition of a hotspot that was nuanced and wasn't just this carte blanche 'lock up and leave' approach of Daniel Andrews in my home state. That is the reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite are characterising how Victorian senators in this place feel about how our citizenry is being treated, how our economy's been decimated and how at the end of last year 26,000 people fled to other states to live. If you had seen the line-up of cars, including four-wheel drives, with tents stuffed in the back or caravans hitched to the back, with families shoved in them so they could exit Melbourne as quickly as possible at the start of the last lockdown, you would have thought you were in a Third World country and we were about to have a military coup. That is actually the reality, because none of these decisions are being made on medical advice. They are simply being made by an incompetent state government which cannot get its act together after 18 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will call once again for a nationally consistent approach to the definition of a hotspot—that would be great—a nationally consistent approach to handling quarantine and a consistent approach to contact tracing, because both Labor and Liberal states have been able to keep themselves open and going, but there is something decaying and wrong at the heart of the state Labor government in my home state, the name of which starts D and ends with N. Really, you have to live there to understand what it feels like. Presentations to hospitals and specialists by young people with mental health issues have increased by upwards of 30 per cent as a result of this behaviour. Elective surgeries have been postponed. People are now in danger of not getting the health care they need, because of these restrictions. It is absolutely unprecedented, it is unwarranted and it is simply because of their incompetence. For those opposite to come in here from states that are not having to endure this—this particular matter of public importance has been lodged by a Western Australian Labor senator, not even someone who's actually having to live with the reality of these decisions—really gets our goat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you had to go through it, you couldn't believe it. Towns like Mildura are 550 clicks from Melbourne and had lockdown restrictions forced upon them, despite recording zero cases. That's not zero cases this week, this month or this year; it's zero cases ever. But they got, 'We're going to lock down your main street and we're going to stop you burying your loved ones.' We saw a tragic case of that in Warrnambool: a mother begging to have a funeral for her primary-school-aged son down in Warrnambool, and she was denied an exemption by a premier who cares more about inducing Stockholm syndrome in his citizenry to secure the next election than he actually does—</span>

                  </a>  Yes, good question. He cares more for that that he actually does for the health, wellbeing and economic future of our once very proud state.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have those opposite coming in here and taking cheap political shots, when they all know that the Premier has made that decision and that we have fast-tracked an MOU for a federal quarantine facility in Victoria. We took that proposal from the Victorian Labor government—despite them not offering to put a cent on the table, I might add. Those opposite do that, despite knowing we're doing everything and that the vaccine rate is actually accelerating. Every single group of Australians who are getting vaccinated have it happening quicker and quicker, which is great news. And that's despite us stepping in with essential economic support for Victorian families and businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They want to talk about us all being in this together. I can tell them that if they lived in my home state of 'Danistan' they'd know it doesn't feel like we're all in this together. It feels like we're paying the price for a premier who is drunk on power—</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="266524" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I agree with the need for ministers to apologise to Victorians and all Australians. This includes ministers from state governments, particularly in Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia, and the federal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's dive deeper: after 16 months we still have virtually no data and certainly no plan. People are feeling scared and confused. Some are now terrified about the vaccine because crucial universal human needs are not being met—needs like security, health, reassurance, confidence, honesty, leadership, direction, care and competence. Where is the plan for managing this virus and managing our economy? The inconsistent behaviour across states and the nation reveals no plan. Queensland, Victoria and WA have deepened fear and confusion. Ministers are lurching from event to event and crisis to crisis. The people have been abandoned and there is just confusion and lack of accountability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are seven strategies for managing a virus, and I checked these with the Chief Medical Officer and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing. The first one is isolation or lockdowns. The World Health Organization admits that this is only of limited use to get control. So lockdowns are now an admission that the state governments don't have control of their states. They're not managing the virus; the virus is managing the states. We see now in Victoria a 184 per cent increase in attempted suicides by children—184 per cent! Lockdowns are failing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second is testing, tracing and quarantine. These are partially in use, but to very poor standards. The third strategy is restrictions—things like masks and social distancing. These are capricious and dubious in benefit. The fourth one is vaccines. We now have deaths from vaccines and thousands of people dying from vaccines overseas. We have a wide variety of side effects, including blood clots, and the health minister himself has been hospitalised with cellulitis as a side effect. The Chief Medical Officer, the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the head of the federal department of health refused to declare the vaccines 100 per cent safe, and the vaccines fail to prevent transmission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fifth factor is cures and prophylactics. Ivermectin: I took it in 2014. There have been 3.7 billion doses around the world, over six decades. It's proven safe. It's cheap, because it is off patent, and it's now being proven successful—highly successful—overseas. We've had 655 aged-care residents who've died, yet this drug is available, proven and safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two other factors that I won't go into, but the main point is that there's no plan, and governments lurch from event to event and issue to issue. They're making it up as they go; premiers and prime ministers are hiding behind health officers. Australians have had enough of the fearmongering and the spin. Australians need honest, responsible and competent leadership.</span>

Governments right around this country have an obligation to ensure they protect their citizens. This is a new phenomenon that we're all trying to live through.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite frankly, the contributions from some on the other side have been very juvenile, saying that they're not trying to politicise the issue. Sorry, but some on the other side are being political about the issue. They're trying to say that the state government down in Victoria wakes up one morning and somehow decides: 'We want to shut down the state just because we can.' No-one wants to shut down their state. No-one wants to shut down their economy. But every state government has had to make decisions—as has the federal government. Let's not forget that Prime Minister Morrison invited all the state premiers to come together around a concept called the national cabinet. The national cabinet set down the rules that are in place around how we would manage the lockdown and other factors as a result of COVID. So let's all take a deep breath.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that, in our great state of Victoria, we've had quite a few challenges over the last 12 to 18 months. Nonetheless, we are managing through those issues. We have shown the rest of the world that, in how our Commonwealth interrelates with our state governments, we are living in paradise compared to the rest of the world. Do we want to compare how we're going with how they're going over in the UK or the rest of Europe or the United States or Asia or Africa? Quite frankly, I wouldn't rather be anywhere other than here in Australia right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Senator Sterle puts forward a motion, I think we all need to read the words of what he's after. It was around the comments of the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services—no-one else, just the minister: there was 'a very positive record across the board with respect to maintaining a safe border for Australia'. That's what he was claiming. What we are saying is that the minister has misrepresented this place. Time and time again, when we have put questions to him—whether it be here in question time or in estimates—he hasn't been able to provide a straightforward answer, having to go through his pack or not being able to provide simple answers to questions: how many people have been vaccinated, Minister? We cannot get a simple answer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard that today from another minister in this place, when I asked a couple of questions to the minister for the NDIS: how many people have been vaccinated who have been in a home under the care of organisations that are looking after those with a disability? The minister wasn't able to provide a straightforward answer—especially when it came to understanding the difference between group 1a and group 1b.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, before we all get in here, beating our chests and saying what a bad job some of our state governments have been doing, I think we all need to have a look at ourselves and say: 'Have we all been doing a good job? Can we make this situation better for everyone?' I'm sure Senator Van will have a contribution later on, given his cheeky grin across the aisle!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a nation, we find ourselves 12 months into this health event and we are still waiting, sadly, for the federal government to step up, in my opinion, and take more responsibility around quarantine. There have been two issues that Labor has been pushing this government hard on: having a national, consistent quarantine system around the country and making sure that Australians right around the country take up the vaccination to a level at which we can then start to slowly open up our economy. Until we get to that point, we are going to be in this scenario where we'll have constant challenges about what we do when there is an outbreak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reports received in the past couple of hours have suggested that New South Wales has a small outbreak, in the south of Sydney. There may be another one in Queensland. Before we start taking cheap pot shots at Victoria, let's also remember that there are other states that will have to grapple with the issue as soon as we start opening our economy. Ultimately, that is all that we want in this place. We want to protect our economy, because the sooner we can get out of this mess, the sooner we can start creating more jobs and get better outcomes for people right around the nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="283601" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator VAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  I love MPIs, because they are exactly what we always expect from Labor. They throw some Dorothy Dixers at us, and we come back and show just how political they are going to be. While my good friend Senator Ciccone says 'cheap shots', there is nothing cheaper than this MPI today. There is nothing cheaper. We have a very safe record—mostly—in Australia; however, as he said, I will probably have something to say about what the media have called 'Danistan', and have called it that on many occasions. My good friend Senator McKenzie had every right to use that language.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Ciccone was right about one thing: the states came together under national cabinet and they agreed that the states would run hotel quarantine—for very good reasons. They agreed it because they have primary responsibility for the quarantine arrangements under their public health legislation. This enables those jurisdictions to best manage their public health response. Why? Senator Ciccone mentioned Senate estimates. Our Chief Medical Officer said quite clearly in Senate estimates earlier this month that hotel quarantine was clearly a public health matter, and that was why the decision was made—that decision being the states running it. It's probably the most important thing that we have done in relation to keeping Australia safe since that time. The Chief Medical Officer went on to say there had been a lot of questions in that committee, and other places, about types of quarantine. But, the key part, the important part, Senator Ciccone, is you get public health issues right. The Chief Medical Officer went on to say the public health workforce sits in the states. He said, 'My colleagues on AHPPC have ample and very experienced people to do that work, and that is why they chose to do it.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since hotel quarantine measures were implemented—we're talking about an MPI about keeping our borders safe—more than 358,000 international air arrivals have come into hotel quarantine. Among those international air arrivals, there has been an estimated 3,900 COVID cases, the majority of which were detected in hotel quarantine. This represents approximately 1.1 per cent of all international air arrivals that became COVID-19 positive. Out of those, only six have gone on beyond the household of the person—either a worker or someone who has been released from quarantine. I am paraphrasing our CMO, Professor Paul Kelly. Six out of 3,900 positive cases is an extraordinary record of how we have managed our borders. Managed quarantine has been Australia's first line of defence, and Professor Kelly went on to say hotel quarantine was the most key 'ring of containment'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where did those cases go, those six that went out there? They started going onto other things. How have states managed where cases have got out of hotel quarantine? Well, that job is down to contact tracing, and that's where my home state, the one that the media called 'Danistan', has failed miserably. Every sitting period last year, I challenged my Victorian Senate colleagues to talk about what was happening in 'Danistan'. They never once said a word about lock down; they never once said a word about hotel quarantine; they never once said a word about the failures of contact tracing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the empirical evidence here. Australia has had, and I think this is pretty close to accurate as of today, 30,274 cases. Victoria had 20,668 cases, so 68 per cent of cases were in Victoria. Australia had, sadly, 910 deaths. Victoria had 820 of those deaths. So 90 per cent of deaths due to COVID happened in Victoria. That empirical evidence shows the failure in my home state, my very proud home state, the one that the media called 'Danistan'.</span>

                  </a>  Senator Lambie is right. It's no way to run the country. We have seen a fair bit of that. To come in here and say to senators we're now going to pull on—at 5.45 pm, when adjournment is at 7.20 pm—a debate on three bills, which are listed later in the program and that are supposed to be debated tomorrow, is pretty extraordinary and, frankly, very discourteous. I accept that Senator Hanson and Senator Roberts may have differences of views about the content of legislation. I accept that Senator Griff may have differences of views about content of legislation, but it is no way to legislate to turn up in the chamber at quarter to six on a Wednesday night and demand that the Senate sit late in order to deal with this because you have got a deal.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next time the government wants some cooperation from the chamber around its program you might want to think back to this moment, Senator Birmingham. You might want to think back to this moment. It really is amateur hour on legislation which is important. We have very strong differences of views with the government on the legislation which need to be ventilated. There is a committee stage which needs to be dealt with. All of that is legitimate. What is not legitimate is to do a deal, come in here at quarter to six and then not even want a debate on this motion. I am only speaking because you give me the charity of allowing me to speak. Senator Griff can't speak. Are you going to let him? Senator Lambie can't speak. Are you going to let her?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is really undemocratic to turn up and say, 'We're going to roll over the Senate program.' It is Senator Birmingham's program that he is now up-ending because he has decided it is better for him. 'We will roll over our program. We're not even going to let you debate it. We will do it with a vote of somebody who is not here.' That is what he is going to do. I am quite astounded at this way of managing the chamber. I am quite astounded that the government thinks it can just rock up with a few minutes notice—I got my first telephone call at 5.10; I don't know when other senators got theirs—and say: 'We've got the numbers. We're going to ram this through.' The government thinks it can rock up and up-end the program and say, 'By the way, senators, the Senate is going to sit tonight and deal with these three bills until it rises.' What sort of way is this to run government? I hope that for once you might actually tell us what the dirty deal is; usually we have to try and grab it out of you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The way this government chooses to exercise its numbers in this chamber is really quite shameful, as is the lack of courtesy given to senators and to the Senate about this. Equally, it demonstrates a lack of respect for this institution that the minister won't even allow this change to be properly debated. I would say to this minister—and I see other crossbench senators here: you should have the courage to debate this motion. If you think it is such a great idea to turn up in the Senate and say, 'By the way, we're going to sit as late as it takes tonight to pass the second reading of three bills, and I'm only going to give you an hour and a bit's notice', you come in here and defend it. You stand up and defend it and explain why it's in the interests of democracy. As far as we can see, it is not. It is no way to run this chamber. It is disrespectful to other senators and it is disrespectful to this chamber as a legislative chamber.</span>

First the government blocks a bill, which has only happened five times in the history of the Senate, and now, proverbially at five seconds to midnight, I get a missed call from Senator Birmingham, and we will be sitting all night to do second reading speeches on three contentious bills, and, conveniently, the time for voting on those bills tomorrow will be when we would otherwise be doing motions. How convenient for this government to avoid scrutiny of the matters that we would have put to a vote tomorrow in motions, because it couldn't arrange its way out of a paper bag. This is a disgusting abuse of process. This government uses this chamber like a plaything. It picks up process and puts it down as it suits. This is sheer opportunism on display. Once again, One Nation is facilitating this government treating the Senate like a rubber stamp, and here we go. See you later at the next election!</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>):  I present the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation Committee's Delegated Legislation Monitor No. 8 of 2021 and move: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take this opportunity to draw the chamber's attention to the committee's scrutiny concerns regarding the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Amendment (2020<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:MS Mincho;&#xD;&#xA;  ">‑</span>21 Budget Programs) Regulations 2021. The instrument amends the principal ARENA regulations to allow ARENA to invest in non-renewable energy technologies. The committee is concerned that this instrument expands the remit of ARENA beyond what was envisaged by parliament when the act was passed and may therefore be beyond the scope of this enabling act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the view of the committee that there is nothing in the explanatory memorandum to the bill proceeding the act to suggest that it was ever contemplated that ARENA would have the ability to foster anything other than renewable energy technologies. The introduction of these significant changes to the role of this agency via delegated legislation instead of primary legislation is of significant scrutiny concern to the committee. As a result, the committee will write to Minister Taylor about these scrutiny concerns. I will update the chamber about progress in relation to resolving this important matter in due course.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Concerningly, this is not the only instrument the committee has scrutinised recently which significantly expands on entities, jurisdiction and powers. Earlier this year I advised the chamber of the committee's concerns regarding the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Amendment (Law Enforcement Agencies) Regulations 2020. This instrument significantly expands the jurisdiction and, therefore, the investigative powers of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity to include the ACCC, APRA, ASIC and the ATO. I am pleased to advise that, today, the Attorney-General has made an undertaking to amend this instrument so that it will repeal in three years. The committee welcomes this undertaking, which will provide an opportunity for this significant expansion of ACLEI's jurisdiction to be set out in standalone primary legislation prior to the sunset date in 2024 or at least in a further regulation, which would provide an opportunity for further parliamentary consideration of this significant measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to advise the chamber about significant progress that is being made in relation to the committee's ongoing scrutiny concerns regarding delegated legislation in the Treasury portfolio which modifies the operation of primary legislation, in some cases for over 10 years. I thank the Treasurer for his continued good faith engagement on this issue with the committee. I am pleased to advise that, last month, the Treasurer made a number of undertakings to the committee to ensure that explanatory material for instruments which modify the operation of primary legislation will in the future include the information and justifications required by the committee. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer also undertook to consider the duration of these instruments, including whether shorter time frames can be applied and to consider whether amendments to the primary legislation can be made instead. In this regard, the Treasurer has already indicated that an expansion to the types of services that BAS agents may provide an exemption for employee share schemes will be moved from delegated to primary legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, the Treasurer advised the committee that his office and department will continue to engage with all of the agencies in his portfolio, including the regulators, to ensure that the committee's concerns are addressed before instruments are made. The committee looks forward to continuing to work with the Treasurer to address these scrutiny issues over the long-term.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Sonnenkrieg Division has not previously been listed as a terrorist organisation by the Australian government. It is the first extreme right-wing organisation to be listed in Australia. The committee is currently conducting an inquiry into extremist movements and radicalism in Australia and may make further recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The regulations to list the Sonnenkrieg Division were tabled in the parliament on 23 March 2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's review examines the minister's decision to list this organisation. Section 102.1A of the Criminal Code provides that the committee may review a regulation which lists or re-lists an organisation as a terrorist organisation and report its comments and recommendations to each house of the parliament before the end of the applicable 15 sitting-day disallowance period. This statement serves this purpose and is being presented within the required period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In determining whether the regulations listing this organisation should be supported, the committee reviewed the merits in accordance with the Minister for Home Affairs's explanatory statement, ASIO's statement of reasons for the organisation, and other publicly available information. This included a submission received from the Australia/Israel &amp; Jewish Affairs Council. Their submission is supportive of the listing and makes note of the threat to the Australia-Jewish community by individuals and groups who have racist and nationalist ideologies and suggests the government consider additional approaches to combating the threat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its deliberations, the committee determined that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">the Sonnenkrieg Division seeks to encourage lone-actor terrorist attacks against its political, racial, and ethnic enemies. SKD members acting on behalf of the organisation, have encouraged, promoted, and glorified terrorist acts through online propaganda. SKD adheres to an ideology that is violently opposed to multiethnic Western societies and there is a possibility that a lone-actor attack directed or inspired by SKD could result in harm to Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst Australians are not directly involved in SKD its encouragement, promotion and glorification of lone-actor attacks could inspire some Australian extremists, and the availability of SKD propaganda online has the potential to contribute to the radicalisation of others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee encourages the government to continue investigating other like-minded organisations with a mind to listing them as terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code, if they meet the criteria. The committee will continue its own investigations in this regard through its concurrent inquiry into extremist movements and radicalism in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In examining the evidence that has been provided, the committee is satisfied with the listing processes and considers that they have been followed appropriately for this organisation. The committee therefore supports the listing of the organisation under division 102 of the Criminal Code in order to protect Australians and Australia's interests, and finds no reason to disallow the regulations.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="LNW" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KENEALLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:18</span>):  I rise to take note of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's statement for the review of regulations listing Sonnenkrieg Division as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code Act 1995. I acknowledge the comments of the chair of the committee, Senator Paterson, and do associate myself with his remarks as a member of the intelligence and security committee. I note that this is a bipartisan report and a unanimous report of the intelligence and security committee. I also wish to place on the record my appreciation for the way in which the committee operates in the national interest and in a bipartisan fashion. I do want to make some comments regarding the listing of the Sonnenkrieg Division and the rise of right-wing extremism in Australia, but, in doing so, I want to be clear that I support Senator Paterson in his remarks and the listing that has been provided here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sonnenkrieg Division is the first right-wing organisation to be listed in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For anyone who has been paying attention, the fact that right-wing extremist groups have found an audience in Australia sadly comes as no shock. What is shocking is that it has taken this government this long to prescribe just one right-wing terrorist organisation. What is shocking is how long it has taken for this government to realise how very real and very serious the threat posed by right-wing extremism is to our safety and our democracy. I do use the term 'right-wing extremism' deliberately. As the ASIO director-general said, he is using terms such as 'religiously motivated' and 'politically motivated ideology', but he also acknowledges that it is appropriate at times to use the specific term 'right-wing extremism' to name the threat that we face, and this is certainly an appropriate term to use in the context of the Sonnenkrieg Division. What is shocking is that this government has not done more to censure those in its own ranks who promote or permit dangerous right-wing ideas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month, the ASIO director-general, Mr Mike Burgess, told Senate estimates that right-wing extremism is approaching 50 per cent of ASIO's counterterrorism workload. Only three years ago, that was just 16 per cent. In those three years, we have watched in horror as an Australian man, a right-wing extremist who was radicalised here in this country, attacked two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, killing 51 people and injuring dozens more. We've seen his manifesto and his actions spread and find an audience online, joining other racist, divisive and hateful ideas that seek to inspire acts of harm, and we've watched those who expound such ideas deliberately navigate the law as it stands to avoid sanction, even as they clearly encourage violence, display paraphernalia and propagate ideas that disgust and dismay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've watched again in horror as the product of a conspiracy theory and the extreme right-wing attacked the United States Capitol in January. It was a day when democracy came under direct assault from an ideology that many were too slow to take seriously. Yet this was the day that the Prime Minister's good friend, far-Right conspiracy theorist Tim Stewart, described as 'one of the greatest days on earth'. The FBI has warned us that this was no anomaly and that QAnon and its far-Right bedfellows could carry out more violence. That's a warning that came as recently as this week. The NYPD has warned that this is a broad movement with anti-Semitic underpinnings, and the Biden administration has warned of the risks of underestimating how quickly and easily far-Right digital campaigns can cross into the physical domain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In January, in Washington, we saw all too clearly what happens when the far Right is allowed political space, when far-Right extremist thinking is not immediately excised and far-Right extremist proponents are not immediately exiled from political influence. That such thinking can gain traction in some members opposite and, most concerningly, in the personal relationships of Australia's Prime Minister should appal us all. We should be appalled that someone who could believe in and promote such fear and hatred could be trusted by Mr Morrison to house-sit the official residence at Kirribilli, and it should appal us that Mr Morrison will still not answer questions about whether he has received briefings from his department or other agencies on the dangers posed by QAnon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot let extreme right-wing views gain any more ground here, for we have seen how very quickly what seems like a fringe idea, what seems ridiculous and unthinkable, can become a tragic, terrifying reality. Here in Australia, our security agencies are warning of the increasing threat posed by right-wing extremism. Mr Burgess said it was 50 per cent of ASIO's domestic terrorism workload. Yet this government has only seen fit to list one right-wing group, and only this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Five Eyes partners have been awake to this threat for some time. We are the last of our partners to recognise right-wing extremism for the terrorism that it is, but the Morrison government has, sadly, been caught sleeping. This is why Labor called for a bipartisan inquiry into extremist movements and radicalisation. What we've heard from the experts so far is that right-wing extremists in Australia are more organised, sophisticated, ideological and active than ever before. In Australia, this year, right-wing extremists have been arrested on counterterrorism charges, in possession of weapons and improvised explosives, and right-wing extremist groups have gathered openly, burning crosses, chanting Nazi slogans and championing white supremacy in open defiance of everything that Australia stands for as a country and as a society. Make no mistake: the threat of right-wing extremism is real, and it is increasing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PJCIS found that Australians had little direct involvement with Sonnenkrieg Division but that it had reached into Australia via its online activities and posed a threat through its potential to radicalise and its incitement of terrorist attacks. But there are other far-right extremist groups active in Australia that also meet the requirements of prescription. They are hiding in plain sight. They are the ones gathering and terrorising our community here in Australia already. The pandemic has shifted more of our interactions online, and this, along with the economic and social impacts and the anxieties and uncertainties of the last 15 months, has intensified the spread of right-wing extremist narratives. What is most concerning—terrifying even—is that some in the media and some in politics entertain these insidious, dangerous views. We cannot allow the mainstreaming of these views. The Morrison government must sever itself from those who promote or give comfort to conspiracies and far-Right extremist views, even if they exist in the coalition party room. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, never takes responsibility. He always finds someone else to blame, but this is about our safety and our democracy. This responsibility is too important for him to shirk. We need to deny territory online and otherwise to the extreme right wing and their corrosive ideas. We must work with online providers to monitor and remove abhorrent, violent, extremist right-wing content. We must encourage prevention through improved deradicalisation programs and interrupt radicalisation when it's occurring. We must ensure our security agencies have the right funding, settings and legislation to combat the evolving far-Right extremist threat. The government has the prescription powers to list extremist right-wing groups as terrorist organisations. They should do so to make abundantly clear that Australia will not tolerate racist, divisive and violent ideology. I call on the government to make clear that they care about the safety of all Australians by listening to our national security experts and taking the threat of far-Right extremists seriously.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The head of Home Affairs says the drums of war are beating with China, but the coalition and Labor don't want the Senate to look into it—again. Our largest trading partner is squeezing the bejesus out of our beef farmers, wineries and barley growers, but the major parties reckon there's no reason for the Senate to get involved. A country that is known for human rights abuses and its disdain for democracy is openly trying to influence what goes on in this chamber—they've even hacked this building on numerous occasions—but the government and opposition still aren't interested in investigating. They don't want us to look at it. They don't want us to mention the word 'China', let alone 'CCP'. They don't want us to pull up the rug and see what's underneath. They don't want us to do what I reckon 80 per cent of Australians would like us to do: to have a good look at what is going on in China. God forbid! They don't want us to go there. Here's a wake-up call! Get your boots on, because that's what most Australians want. That's what they want.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I bet that what you'll find will not be pretty. We know that, they know that, so let's just get on with it. It will not reflect well on the state of our major parties, who have been caught more than once taking money from people with links to the Chinese Communist Party. It won't look good for Defence, who have stuffed up our military procurement so badly that it's going to take a decade or more for us to build submarines that take China 18 months to bring online, which is something that is seriously wrong. And it won't look good for our foreign affairs department, who have spent months playing politics on the Belt and Road Initiative in Victoria but are too scared to touch the port of Darwin. Keep going on with it! Keep showing them who's running the show here! That's what needs to be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will be the fifth or sixth time Senator Patrick and I have tried to get up an inquiry into this. We are not asking a lot. We're asking what many Australians are asking. They want to know more. Every time we've tried to get this up, the majors have voted against it. That's exactly what you've done. What are you scared of? Time and time again they tell us: 'Nothing to see here. Move it along. Let the bureaucrats deal with it.' Meanwhile one person, a senior bureaucrat, is saying: 'Hey, beating the drum here! Going to war!' Which one is it? Let the people in fancy suits at the G7s and the WTOs and whatever else have their conversations over tea and sort all this out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the sad truth of this matter: the major parties won't let the Australian people have a say in what is going on here. They don't want us to get a good look at it through a parliamentary inquiry. They won't front up to the Senate and say: 'Yes, we have a problem here. Yes, it's difficult. But we trust in the key principle of Australian democracy, in our own democracy, that the people should have a say about the things that affect their lives.' This is where we're at. The Senate is a place where we are supposed to review. We are supposed to debate. We are supposed to take our time, go into detail, make it a better country. That's where our strength comes from. The way we elect people in the Senate is designed to protect the small states from being controlled by the large ones. It's a sentiment we in Australia should be familiar with—if the little guy needs some help, give a helping hand. When it works, it works well. We pass things, we block things, we debate, we turn up and we do our jobs. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion, this inquiry, this is part of our job, as difficult as it is. As difficult as it is, it is part of our job up here. If you are going to let fear hold you back, none of you should be here. Fear will never achieve anything, let alone get to the bottom of it. If you want fear to rule your life, be my guest—but that is not a way to run a country. This is the sad part about it all. We are trying to defend our own democratic principles from a country that's hostile to them, but our own parliament is failing to meet the standard we set for it and it is failing the people of this country by not doing what it should be doing, out of fear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're in terrible shape here and this has been going on for way too long. It is not going away. How many times do Senator Patrick and I have to move this motion before the coalition and Labor wake up? It is time to wake up. It will go against you in the next election, I can assure you. Go out there and have a look and listen to the Australian people. They're onto it. It's no good ignoring it, because they're already onto it. They're miles ahead of us. What we're asking for shouldn't be controversial. It's not about playing politics or making a cheap shot or looking for a headline. It is plain as day that we have a problem, and it should be plain as day that we can't do nothing about it. We cannot sit here and say: 'There's nothing to see here. We don't want to deal with this. We can't deal with this.' That is not how leaders act. That is not how our parliament in this country should act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't go to war with our biggest trading partner and expect that to be cost free. We are going to pay a cost for that. But either we shut up and don't say anything and let them continue to walk over the top of us or we stand up for ourselves, we stand up for this country and we stand up for the people that walk the soil in this country. That's what we do. We have to be brave and do that. It doesn't matter what the issue is, ignoring it will never make that issue go away. It will only make it worse. That is human psych. That is how it works. Suppressing an inquiry, suppressing questions, is not how you ease tensions. You can't wish away this problem. You can't pull out your wand. It is not going away, and ignoring it is making it worse. When you wake up to that fact, it's going to be even worse still and trying to make amends the further we go along is going to be even harder. Deal with it today. We have a problem with China. Be honest about it and deal with it. Show the courage that this country needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are being told here that everything's under control and we just need to leave it to the unelected bureaucrats and public servants to take care of it while we keep ourselves busy asking each other softball questions in question time. That's not how this works. This Senate is an institution of the Australian democracy. This is an institution that has been threatened by the growing aggression of the Chinese Communist Party. We have been hacked. We have had our phones, our computers and our networks here in this building hacked by the people we are pinning our hopes on for an economic recovery. How stupid are we? We're supposed to be some of the smartest and brightest up here. If that's smart and bright, God blow me over.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even our security agencies say that there have been 500 cases of foreign agents attempting to influence Australian politics in recent months. Most of it's coming from the CCP. That's right—China. That's where it's coming from. But we are running on fear. We're running in the wrong direction. We're certainly not running the Australian way. They are actively trying to shape how our politicians behave when up here in parliament. That's what they're doing. If you can't see that, wake up or go to Specsavers and have a good look, because that is what is going on. Party agents are working their way into political offices and party fundraising events and they're collecting information and using it to their advantage against us. They are doing what they can to change the decisions that get made right here in this very chamber. They want to pull the strings on these votes, these decisions we make. They want to have a say on what we do in here. It's about time we told them that they're not getting a say in this parliament, that they're not getting a say on how to run this country. But we can't do that by being silent and showing fear. It's time to set the record straight and say: 'We don't give a stuff what the consequences are. We're not putting up with your behaviour and your threats against our own sovereign nation.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have sat here over the years and watched as veterans have had their lives taken from them in fighting for this country and its freedoms, while you're letting the CCP walk all over the top of us. Why is it so controversial to say that the Senate should look into this? Why is it so controversial to say that Australians have a right to know about this? It's only through institutions like the Senate that we get the ability to have an open, transparent conversation with the Australian people about what is at stake, what is at risk and what our choices are in the future. I don't think we've got time up our sleeve; I can tell you that much right now. If you're going to sit in here and think, 'This is just going to go away; I don't want to deal with it,' you're on another planet. You had better deal with the CCP and with China, and you had better do it quickly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the drums of war are beating, how loud are they? How far away? How long? If Australia's relationship with the Chinese Communist Party is what's contributing to that rising tension then don't we in the Senate owe it to the nation to investigate what parts of the relationship are making us vulnerable and what parts need to change? The first thing we need to change in here is to show some courage. We're an island nation. Last time I checked, we didn't have missiles all around the outside of us to scare anybody, let alone China. We have just enough troops to fill over half the MCG; that's where we're at. And I can guarantee that only about 3,000 of them are fighters—combat, they call it. If you want to sit here and see where China goes with all this then be my guest. But I would suggest we start leading on the front foot and we start controlling the situation, instead of the other way around, before it's too late to do anything, which is exactly where we are heading.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All we're asking for is an inquiry. That is it. We already know there are elements of influence of China in Australia that are positive—of course they are. But there is a lot of stuff coming from the Chinese government that scares the bejesus out of me and everybody else out there. But we won't talk about it, because we won't show that we have fear of it. There's nothing wrong with showing a bit of fear. For goodness sakes, come out and do something about it so you can defeat it. If there is a way to salvage parts of our relationship with China, that's good. If there is a way to shut down the bits that are toxic, that's great—although I don't see that happening; I think it's going to go a lot further than that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're asking the Senate to have a grown-up conversation with the Australian people about the problems we are facing with the CCP and China. That is what we're asking. We have problems and issues here. Like I said, the Australian people already know, and while you're sitting here ignoring it you're not looking in a good light, I can tell you. They already know; they're out there talking about it. You can put it to rest and take control of the situation and run with this inquiry. Let the truth come out. We need to start telling people what's going on and what the plan is. But we have no plan on how to deal with them, except: 'Just ignore them. Pretend they're not there. They'll go away.' They ain't going away! Let me be quite clear about this: they are not going away. And the situation is only getting worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How much worse do you want the situation? With whatever is left of our relationship with China, which is not much, how much further do you want this to go? How much more damage is this going to do? If it's going to do damage, great; let's blow it out of the water and let's go do it. But this slow, strangling death thing that we're doing by just saying, 'It's okay; there's nothing to see here,' is putting all Australians' lives at risk. You have no idea what their plan is for us in the future. I know something: they have military hardware we can only dream of, they can move a hell of a lot quicker than we can and they can shut down any trade they want to tomorrow. And you're not worried about that? I would be. I would be terribly worried about that, and I am. So are millions of other Australians out there, and you're doing nothing up here to settle that worry. We are doing nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's the crossbench, having to drag the major parties, kicking and screaming, to protect this country's way of life. Why is that? Why is it always the crossbench which has to call this stuff out? Why is it that the crossbenchers are the only ones who have any courage in here? At least I'll know when my time is up that I tried; I got out there and fought for it. I'll be able to sleep at night-time. Good luck to the rest of you, and God hope that we're not at war. I know that the conversations we're having here will be hard and that it's going to be painful for some people, but it's already painful. We're capable of having sensitive conversations without falling into cruelty; we do it a lot. If we were asking for an inquiry into sports medicine, or water trading or climate change we'd have had this inquiry a long time ago. But, no, it's China, and all of a sudden Australia has lost its nerve. It has grown cold feet and is saying, 'I don't want anything to do with this; I'm done.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:46</span>):  I rise to speak in support of Senator Lambie's referral motion about Australia's relationship with China. The Australian Greens support this referral, as we have supported a number of referrals in the past, because our relationship with China is a really important topic that we think deserves serious scrutiny. Our relationship with China is incredibly complex; it's exactly the sort of stuff that the Senate should be considering in a full and proper inquiry process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our relationship includes issues of human rights and our trading relationship, as well as the broader scope of foreign policy issues. We also think it's important to have an inquiry that actually puts the issues on the table in a careful and considered way so that we can have the debate about China in a careful and thoughtful way. And, in particularly, as part of this discussion about China, we must be loudly antiracist and fight attacks against Australians of Chinese heritage. That includes attacks from those within this chamber calling on Chinese Australians to pass loyalty tests. This inquiry would be an excellent opportunity to thoroughly consider these issues. As I said, it's exactly the sort of complex issue that the Senate should be considering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now want to step through some of the issues that the Australian Greens think would be covered in an inquiry, if we were to get one up. We'll start with human rights. We believe that in our relationships with any country around the world human rights should be absolutely at the core and centre of that relationship. We've been consistent in our calls for action on human rights by governments around the world, including the Chinese government. In a state visit by the then Chinese president, Hu Jintao, in 2003, Greens MP Michael Organ wore a Tibetan lapel pin to symbolise the concerns we've raised about the situation of the Tibetan people. Tragically, despite the many years that have passed since then, the human rights situation in China has certainly not got better. In fact, it has got worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Human Rights Watch summarised in a recent report how Beijing's repression, insisting on political loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party, has deepened across the country. In Hong Kong, following six months of large-scale protests in 2019, the Chinese government imposed a draconian national security law on 30 June. This was its most aggressive assault on the Hong Kong people's freedom since the transfer of sovereignty in 1997. In Xinjiang, Turkic Muslims continue to be detained arbitrarily on the basis of their identity, while others are subjected to forced labour, mass surveillance and political indoctrination. In Inner Mongolia, protests broke out in September when educational authorities decided to replace Mongolian with Mandarin Chinese in a number of classes in the region's schools. And authorities in Tibetan areas continue to severely restrict religious freedom, speech, movement and assembly, and fail to address popular concerns about mining and land grabs by local officials. This often involves intimidation and unlawful use of force by security forces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have met with Tibetans, Uighurs and Hongkongers who have told me what the on-the-ground impacts of those policies are. In fact, it was only yesterday that this parliament received a delegation of Uighur Australians who told the tragic stories of the awful conditions and situations that their relatives in Xinjiang were suffering through—their sisters, husbands or other family members who were imprisoned, who were essentially in concentration camps, who were being tortured and who they hadn't heard from for years. In one case, the only reason given was that the person had travelled to Egypt. Another person had travelled to Turkey. For that, they were then placed in the indoctrination camps or were essentially imprisoned for decades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We think that issues of human rights should be at the core of our relationship with China. Right now, we reiterate our call for the Chinese government to allow access for UN and other independent human rights observers, which is the absolute bottom line—a simple, basic step that they should take immediately. In our relationship with China, we should see action from the Australian government on a framework for targeted sanctions to address these human rights violations, wherever in the world they occur. We have seen the Australian government dragging its feet for months now on proposed Magnitsky legislation. We know that there was a letter sitting on the Prime Minister's desk months ago, and it hasn't been answered. So we need the government to take urgent action and respond to the unanimous cross-partisan recommendation from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade that they introduce Magnitsky legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Lambie was saying, this government seems to want to walk away from these issues. The issues need to be brought front and centre, and certainly having this inquiry will enable these issues to be considered in a holistic, complex way. The inquiry would be an excellent opportunity to consider our trading relationship with China, which clearly is in a position of absolute tumult at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are clear steps that we could be taking to improve our ability to manage our trade relationship with China. The Greens believe that we should be rethinking our political economy and shifting away from a reliance on an extractive based economy to one where we add value through a strong domestic manufacturing sector powered by renewables like green hydrogen. This applies to all our trading relationships, not just China. Any reduction in our exports of fossil fuels to China, which have been forced on us by the trade embargoes that China is imposing on us, should be seen as an inevitable part of the global transition to net zero in the face of a climate crisis and actually as an opportunity to be reducing our economic reliance on unsustainable fossil fuels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We reckon that the Australian government should be working with Australian industry to diversify our markets following the decades of focus on exports to China as the mainstay of our economic growth. There are so many opportunities. Green steel and green aluminium are some of the possibilities there. Current trade disputes demonstrate that our free trade agreements aren't worth the paper they are written on. These are the issues that should be considered in this type of inquiry. What does it mean to have a free trade agreement with China in the current situation, when they can basically just tear it up? These are the very things that we should be considering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving on to our broader foreign policy, it really needs to be seriously looked at. The Australian Greens believe that in our international relations we should be promoting peace, democracy, ecological sustainability, equity, justice and human rights. This applies to our relationship with China, as it does for every other country in the world. As part of that, again, something that could be really seriously looked at in this inquiry, given the relationship between the US and China, is the very strong argument that we as Australians should be pursuing an independent foreign policy. That should include renegotiating the US alliance, because an unthinking alliance with the US means that we are not seen as an honest, independent broker in our region, including with China. Hitching our wagon to the Trump administration was a really powerful example of this, and it significantly contributed to the current dire state of the bilateral relationship that we have with China. The alliance with the US makes us less safe, not more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, I think that, if we are going to have a focus on our relationship with China that's based on human rights, it would also include looking at the influence that we have, as Australia, while our human rights here in Australia are under question. While we continue to turn a blind eye to the ongoing injustices and racism suffered by our First Nations peoples and ignore calls for truth-telling and for treaties, while we jail innocent asylum seekers and refugees indefinitely, and while we are criminalising Australians seeking to return home, we are vulnerable to accusations of hypocrisy on the world stage. We are not in a position where we can forcibly say to China, 'You need to be addressing your human rights abuses,' while these things are ongoing in Australia. The Australian government can talk about a rules based order in as many white papers, policy statements and major speeches as it likes, but, until we walk the talk, we are continually undermining our credibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we think that, as part of looking at our relationship with China, what we need to really keep a focus on is the need to reject racism. We need to have a strongly antiracist approach. The significant focus in the media and in this place on the threat from the Chinese government, as well as the Australian government's focus on Chinese foreign influence, has been damaging to Asian communities in Australia, to international students and to other visitors to Australia with Asian heritage. We need to keep that in mind, and we need to make sure that we are always supporting Australians and others in Australia of Asian heritage and that, when we are being critical of the Chinese government, of the Chinese Communist Party, it doesn't flow over into racism, into xenophobia and into attacks, prejudice and discrimination against people of Chinese heritage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Asian Australians, permanent residents and temporary visa holders must be able to participate freely in all aspects of Australian society. In having this sort of debate, we believe that, if we got this inquiry up, it would be really important throughout that to continue to call out racism and champion the rights of our multicultural communities. Our relationship with China is incredibly complex, and it is exactly because of that complexity that it is a very appropriate issue for the Senate to be looking into. The Greens are very definitely in support of this motion to set up this Senate inquiry to consider Australia's complex relationship with the People's Republic of China.</span>

                    <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  I am pleased to support the motion moved by Senator Lambie. In fact, it is the same motion, or in the same terms, as the one I proposed for an inquiry a year ago, on 10 June 2020. That proposed motion was, in turn, the sixth in a series of motions over 18 months seeking a referral to a committee on the topic of China, all of which were rejected by the coalition and Labor. Neither has offered a satisfactory explanation as to why the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee should not inquire into the future of one of Australia's most important international relationships.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would argue that the Senate's refusal to establish an inquiry two years ago, or even a year ago, was a major lost opportunity. Such an inquiry could have engaged the full range of interests and stakeholders involved in our relations with China. The advantages of such an engagement and discussion were clear then and are even more obvious now. Again, this inquiry would be about looking at areas where there is good in the relationship but also areas that we need to avoid, fix or take action in regard to. I think that's even more important now, as we face a very challenging set of circumstances presented to us by the People's Republic of China.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of coalition senators and Labor senators have privately expressed to me their interest in support for an inquiry into our relations with China. Senator Kitching was once prepared to co-sponsor a motion, only to withdraw at the last minute. Senator Fierravanti-Wells did vote for this motion when it was last put to a vote, last year, and I thank her for that. In any case, we have a motion before us today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our relationship with China is at its lowest ebb since the late 1960s. The way forward is uncertain and fraught with difficulty as we seek to maintain a diplomatic dialogue with Beijing while defending our national interests and our sovereignty. In these circumstances, a wide-ranging Senate inquiry to report by 30 November would be useful and indeed essential to help chart the way forward, and I commend the motion to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I note that this is the seventh time that this motion or a similar motion has been moved. I thank Senator Lambie and, before her, Senator Patrick for moving similar motions. I want to make it clear that the Chinese people have a long and overwhelmingly positive relationship with Australia, starting in the early days on our soil before our nation was even born. From Cape York to Victoria, the Chinese people have contributed marvellously, and I've welcomed their ongoing contribution on our shores without influence from the Chinese Communist Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been many apparent conflicts of interest raised publicly between Chinese officials, including Chinese Communist Party officials and Labor MPs and between Chinese Communist Party officials and Liberals MPs and officials. Despite this, on every occasion, the Liberal Nationals and Labor senators have combined to jointly oppose this inquiry and its predecessors into the China-Australia relationship. I won't list all the many items that we have raised in the past to justify this inquiry and I won't go through them yet again; I will cover some new material. We have supported this motion in the past and we'll continue to do so until we get what the Australian people need and want.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What have both the tired old parties got to hide? Why are they putting their interests ahead of our national interest, especially because, in recent years, the Australia-China relationship—or, should I say, the Australia-Chinese Communist Party relationship—has undergone significant adjustments? It was only this week that, based on advice from the Director-General of Security, Mr Mike Burgess, the CSIRO announced that it would not renew an oceans research collaboration with the Chinese Qingdao National Marine Laboratory—which has strong military links—following an ASIO warning that the joint project could help Chinese navy operations against Australian submarines. It was during the March 2020 estimates that I raised the alarm about this danger with Mr Burgess, who responded that he was not aware of that particular research at the time of questioning. This week's response has taken 15 months to take effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's apparent that these actions are designed to minimise the extensive intrusion into Australia's sovereignty that the totalitarian Chinese Communist Party government has achieved to date. Never before has the demonstrably anti-freedom, totalitarian Chinese Communist Party government flexed its muscles more than the posturing occurring today. The Chinese Communist Party has never been more active in the areas of expansionism and neo-colonialism in the economic sphere and in military realms, sometimes in the guise of building friendships with less affluent or emerging countries, as part of the Chinese Belt and Road regime. Some describe this intrusion as assaults on the sovereignty of countries. One Nation and I agree with that view.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When China was a Third World country, Australia was a willing neighbour in helping China to develop and grow. Even though much of China remains Third World, with poverty and food shortages, minimal human rights and with a massive population, despite this, and with advanced industrialisation and significant economic power, China is now approaching economic superpower status with a massive defence capability challenging the already established other superpowers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A reasonable country would harness its abilities to assist the advancement of its people. Unfortunately, the Chinese Communist Party has taken an entirely different approach. It has taken an expansionist path that's creating tensions in the delicate balance between countries. That now threatens international relationships both economically and by way of military threat, to the smaller and even large countries around it. The path includes bullying tactics, economic threats and threats of direct military intervention when any country objects to the Communist Party's tactics on the world stage. We simply need to look at Chinese President Xi's statement directed towards Australia and the economic decisions his government makes with the intent to punish Australia for having called out the Chinese Communist Party on subjects including the source of the China virus, COVID-19, or the Chinese Communist Party's poor human rights record in persecuting the Uighurs and putting the whole nation of Tibet under house arrest. The Chinese Communist Party's economic retaliation against Australia as payback was swift. Brazenly, the Chinese government announced to the world that their economic retaliation against Australia was payback for calling for the inquiry into the source of the world's current virus crisis. China is now widely accepted as the source.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These acts are examples showing that the Chinese Communist Party still have a long way to go before being recognised as leaders of a genuine superpower. This is what the Chinese Communist Party craves: positive recognition as a genuine world power capable of performing a responsible leadership role. If the best that the Chinese Communist Party can do is to be considered a world-class bully, that's not much of a goal, and history shows that bullies always get what's coming to them in the end.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is finally waking up to the Chinese Communist Party's overall plan. With the tightening of Australian national security concerns, the cancelling of the Belt and Road contract between Victoria and the Chinese Communist Party and the strengthening of ties with like-minded democratic countries, Australia is making headway in responding to the less-than-veiled threats from the Chinese Communist Party. In addition to the CSIRO's assistance to the Chinese Communist Party agency, I referred to the widespread Chinese ownership of prime Australian land and key strategic assets. The impact of Chinese influence in our universities and communities is yet to be fully considered. The Chinese Communist Party actively attempts to influence its students to not enrol in Australian universities, suggesting that the students would be at risk of discrimination. The placing of trade restrictions on the import of Australian produce, including a massive excise duty on barley, was said to be specifically aimed at damaging the export market for barley as a punishment aimed at Australian trade. Fortunately, Australian farmers are resilient and they've found new markets. But that was some stress that they could have done without.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would hope that the Australian government continues to wind back more of these arrangements with the Chinese Communist Party that do not support Australian values. The Australian relationship with the Chinese Communist Party government will only improve when the Chinese Communist Party acts as a good neighbour and turns away from its existing destructive policies. It's beyond time to have an inquiry into the development of Australia's relationship with the Chinese Communist Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome, as I said, the ongoing contribution of the Chinese people on our shores, but without the influence from the Chinese Communist Party. We need to restore freedoms in our country and restore our national sovereignty. We need to protect our country. We need an inquiry into the China-Australia relationship.</span>

                    </a>  Oh, that's harsh! Alright. This legislation has been subjected to extraordinarily expedited processes, with only weeks offered to make submissions when the bill was presented in a draft form and a mere two-week inquiry by the environment and communications committee. At both stages, committee members made clear that there was not enough time to make detailed submissions to address the complex elements of the legislation. The result of this extraordinarily unjustified speed with which this legislation has been rammed through is that it has the potential to pose profound unintended consequences among segments of our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me just say this very clearly: sex workers in this country are some of the most underrepresented workers in our community. They are not subject to many of the protections that are available to others that work in other industries. This absence of protection is because of the inability of legislatures like this one—and the unwillingness of legislatures such as this one—to grapple with the complexities of the work and the protections that they require. Regardless of the fact that this chamber seems to be preparing itself to pass a piece of legislation which may have catastrophic impacts on the ability of sex workers to work, let me say this very, very clearly: sex work is work. Sex workers are workers and they deserve proper protections to do their work and they should not be impinged in doing that work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, because it has been rushed through, because it has not been subject to the appropriate scrutiny, contains many provisions which may well negatively impact the ability of a sex worker to work, not least of which is the importation of definitions of classified material straight from the classification codes which we know are outdated and the empowering of the relevant administrative body, in this case, the eSafety Commissioner, to be able to make moralistic judgements which may negatively affect the ability of a sex worker to do their job. This is a very serious piece of legislation in relation to sex workers and many organisations, from the Scarlet Alliance to Men at Work and many other organisations, attempted to submit in the brief period that they were given in relation to these concerns, and yet none of them have been properly addressed in the course of the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also elements of this bill which will have the potential to negatively impact the trans community; my colleague Senator Rice will speak to that in great detail, I am sure. Additionally there are elements of this legislation which may potentially be used to prevent the publication of imagery and content online.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="121628" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (More Flexible Superannuation) Bill 2020, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Self Managed Superannuation Funds) Bill 2020 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (Your Future, Your Super) Bill 2021. Well, here we are yet again—another day in the Senate and another bill about superannuation. The government have an ideological opposition to superannuation that defies rationality. This is in their DNA. As an opposition backbencher in the 1990s, Mr Tony Abbott described superannuation as 'a con'. All that has changed since then is that they have got marginally better, only barely, at disguising their antipathy towards working people and their representatives having a say over their own future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why ordinary Australians listening to this debate ought to be concerned when the government comes in here and does what it's done tonight—that is, to steal into this chamber under the cover of darkness with a dirty deal to extend hours, with no notice. This is a secret deal which no-one in this chamber, at least on this side, has any information about whatsoever. The bills we're debating tonight will not be the bills that proceed to the committee stage, because the crossbench senators who support these bills—that's the only reason they are being rushed through—have done a deal. Those crossbench senators, the ones who voted for the hours motion tonight, need to come into this chamber and explain the deal they have done. If the Senate is about anything, it is about scrutiny and it is about transparency. Without information about the debate that will take place tomorrow, it is very difficult for senators participating in this second reading debate tonight to understand exactly what it is they will be asked to vote on tomorrow, when these bills are crunched through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we do know one thing: this government cannot be trusted on super—ever. If you are a high-net-worth Australian with a self-managed superannuation fund, you probably have nothing to worry about. If you are running an underperforming for-profit fund, you probably have nothing to worry about. But working Australians hoping for a decent, dignified retirement have learned by now that the government's endless tinkering with superannuation is motivated by nothing but animus. Instead of focusing on the data and the evidence, these bills, like every other bill on super that's been put before us over the past eight years, enact measures that reflect the hostility of the coalition government to industry super. These people simply cannot bear the idea that working people and their representatives will have control over their own money. It is true that the capacity to direct investments into all corners of the Australian economy confers a power on trustees. So why shouldn't that power be exercised by business and by workers in the interests of the Australian economy?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I had hoped to speak on each of these three bills. There are important matters of detail and of principle that deserve to be aired. But, instead, the government has done what it loves to do—cut down the time for debate and scrutiny in this place. I will start with the Treasury Laws Amendment (Your Future, Your Super) Bill 2021. This is a very poorly drafted bill. It will have adverse consequences for vulnerable Australians, it will damage retirement outcomes for ordinary Australians and it will subject our superannuation system to considerable risk. Stakeholders from the ACTU to the Ai Group and the AIST all raised concerns with this legislation. True to form, the government has failed to even engage with these concerns let alone address them. Labor will be moving amendments to try and remedy the worst of the government's legislation. But without these problems being fixed, Labor stands by these stakeholders in saying that this legislation should not be passed unless its worst aspects are removed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just have a bit of a talk about the problems. In the House we were able to convince the government to remove a directions power. This was a power that would have given any Treasurer the power to cancel investments that he or she didn't like. This could have been applied to cancel investments in solar power. It could have been applied to cancel investments in coalmines. Even coalition backbenchers were appalled by this power and by the overreach. But in the legislation before us tonight the government have retained a backdoor regulation-making power in the bill that lets them do exactly the same thing by declaring a payment or an investment as not being in the best financial interests of members. For anyone playing along at home, this is in schedule 3, items 2 and 10. Labor's amendments will remove these backdoor regulation-making powers and ensure that funds are only required to act in the best interests of their members, not in the best political interests of the Treasurer of the day. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government made a commitment to concerned National Party MPs that they'd fixed this problem. They have not. Minister Hume should explain why she is trying to pull one over on her coalition colleagues to give a future Treasurer the power to prevent any particular investment that they choose to oppose—a windfarm perhaps, or maybe a coalmine in a sensitive electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believes that no-one should be stapled to an underperforming fund. Of course, people should be attached to superannuation funds that deliver for them and their family in retirement. That's not what this bill does. One of the very first concerns identified in the economics committee inquiry related to the prospect of up to three million Australians being stapled to underperforming funds. The ACTU has described these provisions as a poor way to achieve the bill's goal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Industry Group also raised concerns about the sequencing of the reforms that would see employees stapled to funds prior to being notified if those funds had failed the new performance test. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The approach to reducing multiple accounts is flawed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Treasury stated that 21 out of the 77 MySuper products are underperforming, and these products hold over $100 billion in assets across three million accounts, charging $1.2 billion in fees annually. Of course, there is also an unknown number of Australians who may be holding underperforming choice accounts. This government's bill completely fails to engage with this problem and raises the prospect of people being stapled to underperforming funds in perpetuity—directly the opposite of what the bill purports to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also seeks to introduce the best financial interest duty. It imposes a positive duty on superannuation trustees to prove that any particular payment made by a superannuation fund is in the best financial interests of members, with no materiality threshold. The Law Council said of this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In our view, trustees already have a duty to act in the best interests of members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The risk is that this system will not just create a burden in terms of accounting, documenting, attesting and providing assurance around that; in the absence of a materiality test, it will also see a vast amount of resources and efforts going into documenting, within a very narrow scope, the costs and benefits of every single decision—failing to take account of the cumulative impacts, the interdependencies et cetera.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How can this be a good decision? How can this be a decision that would support a high-performing superannuation sector? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stakeholders have also raised concerns that the stapling measure may result in workers in high-risk industries missing out on insurance provisions tailored to their industry, and as a result they may not qualify for payments in the event of death or total or permanent disability. The ACTU has commented that the impact is even worse under these proposed laws should the worker be one of the millions who move from a low-risk industry to a high-risk industry. Is there any indication from the government that they intend to fix this problem? No, there is not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his second reading speech on this bill the Treasurer said that every Australian should demand the highest level of accountability and performance from their superannuation fund. Hear, hear to that. That's a sentiment that we can all agree on. But the three million members in the for-profit funds who will receive no protection whatsoever from this bill won't meet that test set by the Treasurer for his own legislation, and that is because of the government's insistence of always focusing on the politics and never on the evidence before them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, this bill will make significant changes to the administration of super in Australia. Every employer around the country is going to need to make changes to their payroll and their employment systems, and super funds will need to make changes to their systems too. Stakeholders across the board have raised concerns about the capacity of all these organisations to be ready for a 1 July commencement, for employers to implement the necessary changes. This bill should not be passed in its current form. If the government were more concerned with protecting Australians' retirement savings and less concerned with prosecuting their ideological agenda they would withdraw it and fix it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury Laws Amendment (Self Managed Superannuation Funds) Bill 2020 is also to be crunched through in the hours motion agreed to this evening. This is another bad bill. We know this because it is what countless submitters to the Senate economics legislation inquiry told us. The evidence was that the bill would primarily benefit high-wealth families, could contribute to undermining the industry super sector and could lead to poorer outcomes for Australian retirees. It's very on brand for the Morrison government. It shows a great deal more enthusiasm for measures that loosen the reins on the financial services industry than measures that are designed to protect consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is concerned that one of the biggest beneficiaries of this bill will be unscrupulous financial advisers who are not working in the interests of fund members. You might ask, quite reasonably, exactly whose side is the government on? Evidence provided to the committee also showed that financial advice had been overwhelmingly not in the best interests of clients and did not comply with the requirement that advice be appropriate. That's coming from ASIC, that's coming from the government's own regulatory agencies, and yet the government persists with the bill. They are deaf to the evidence. They continue to bring forward bills like this, bills like the national consumer credit protection amendments—bills that do not put the interests of Australian consumers at the centre of the government's agenda. Labor has made a series of recommendations as part of the Economics Committee inquiry process and you will be surprised to hear they too have not been taken up by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to the more flexible super bill. At the outset I can confirm that the opposition will be supporting this bill. It makes a series of technical amendments to the operation of our superannuation system. But I want to note a curious point about an amendment that has been circulated. The Pauline Hanson One Nation Party has moved an amendment to this bill to increase the superannuation concessional contribution cap for people aged 67 to $32,500. That all sounds pretty technical doesn't it? This is an issue that is very dear to Senator Hanson. The thing is that many senators breach this cap every year. They usually have to pay thousands of dollars to reconcile their tax bill. This amendment will save senators aged 67 and over a fair bit of money. Can people guess how old Senator Hanson is? Does anyone in this chamber know the answer to that question? I can tell you that Senator Hanson is aged 67. What a coincidence, Deidre Chambers!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, I think she may well be one of the only people who voted for the hours motion. She may well be one of the only people in this chamber who voted for that motion and who will directly benefit from this amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I am curious about is whether this is part of the deal. If it is, people should come in here and say so, because I will be very interested to see if Senator Hanson's amendment, the one that benefits her directly, will be supported by the government as part of their dirty deal tonight. When it comes to debating super in this place, you can be absolutely certain that it is not the interests of the Australian public that are front of mind for this crowd over there.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Mr President. Firstly, on the Treasury Laws Amendment (More Flexible Superannuation) Bill 2020: this bill is yet another in the growing list of little fiddles to the superannuation system that this government wants to make that are simply designed to make the rich richer in this country. I want to be very clear that all of these small and apparently boring tweaks to superannuation only help those who have enough money to benefit from them. I will go into more detail on that legislation if I have time in the 14 minutes remaining to me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Treasury Laws Amendment (Self Managed Superannuation Funds) Bill 2020, which would allow the size of self-managed super funds to be increased from four members to six members: again, it's yet another little tweak to the super system that will be of benefit to the wealthy and next to no use to anyone else. That's perfectly to type for this government, because they are very fixated on the rich getting richer in this country—the rich getting a bigger slice of the pie, which means, of course, poor people in this country get a smaller slice of the pie. This government wants the wealthy to get wealthier, because the wealthy are their mates and the wealthy are their political donors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make a more detailed critique of the government on the 'Your Super, Your Future' bill. It wasn't so long ago that the Liberals were all for superannuation, because the game plan was clear: jerry-rig the system so that the vertically integrated banks could get their hands onto a good chunk of the nearly $3 trillion in retirement savings which exist in this country. The money-grubbers were very eager for a big compulsory super system. This view was espoused by people like Senator Bragg, in his former life as a lobbyist for the Financial Services Council. There, Senator Bragg openly advocated for a rise in compulsory super contributions, not just to the legislated 12 per cent but all the way up to 15 per cent. At that time, Senator Bragg was all for super because he was working for the banks and the banks saw an opportunity to get their hands on a large chunk of money. But then the facts got in the way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, the Productivity Commission review found that not-for-profit industry funds performed better than for-profit retail funds, including those run by the banks. Secondly, it found that keeping super in a default product was likely to yield a better return than if you exercised choice. In other words: the government's own economic rationalist think tank found that most people were better off not playing the market because their default super fund was being well managed by a not-for-profit industry body with union and employee representation on the board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we had the banking royal commission, to which superannuation was added with a view to providing some cover for the absolute walloping that the banks were expected to get, and did in fact duly receive. But that backfired too, with a procession of misdeeds uncovered in bank-run and other for-profit super funds, mostly in the form of excessive fees and keeping people in underperforming funds, with there being not much more than some lavish marketing by one industry fund uncovered because—heaven help us!—industry funds might woo clients in the same way as the rest of the corporate world. So after the Productivity Commission and the banking royal commission, the Liberals had to change their tune—openly spruiking bank-owned super wasn't working for them anymore. So now what did they try to do? That's right: white-ant the entire superannuation system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The likes of Senator Bragg, who has gone to the trouble of writing a book to demonstrate his mea culpa, are now pushing ideas such as super is the reason wages aren't rising, super should be voluntary for young people and—this is one of his best efforts—there isn't enough money in the housing market already so why don't we let people spend their super on housing too? Of course the super-for-housing push is just a reinvention of the aforementioned goal of allowing the banks to get their hands onto super. The trouble for the government is that the public aren't buying this rubbish. By and large, Australians understand and support the system of compulsory retirement savings funding long-term investment. And, secondly, they simply don't trust the likes of Senator Bragg. It's not surprising, given their total about-face and the unpalatability of their actual aim, that this government has served up yet another half baked, bits-and-pieces investment-seminar-buffet piece of legislation. It's all in the name: 'Your Super, Your Future'—signed copies available at the door.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of this bill seeks to eliminate duplicate accounts by stapling workers to a single superannuation fund. So, instead of automatically getting a new account when you get a new job, you'll keep your existing account unless you make an active choice to change accounts. This was a recommendation of the Productivity Commission and was agreed to by the royal commission. But, importantly, the Productivity Commission also recommended changing the system of how workers are allocated to a default fund. But this legislation doesn't propose any changes to the way that workers are allocated to a default fund. It is absolutely half baked.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens are not suggesting that the existing system of creating a new account every time someone gets a new job, unless they choose not to, should be kept as it is; it shouldn't. A lot of people don't know what super they've got where or what to do about choosing a new fund, because—believe it or not—most people don't spend very much time thinking about superannuation. People don't tend to exercise choice with superannuation, which is why introducing stapling, while keeping the existing system of allocating default super through industrial awards, is a back-to-front way of dealing with account duplication.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also offers up a more sinister possibility. Don't put it past the banks to contrive a way to sign up children, potentially 12-year-olds, to their first superannuation account just so they can be stapled to a bank owned fund for life. This bill could usher in Dollarmites for super.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 introduces an annual performance test for default products. There's a two-strike process for products that fail the test. When the first strike happens they inform their members, and when the second strike happens they're closed off to new members. But they still get to keep existing members, who will continue to remain in an underperforming fund that they are now stapled to, thanks to schedule 1. Again, it's a half-baked scenario where schedule 1 and schedule 2 are basically not talking to each other.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stepping back, how is underperformance actually being determined? The bill sets out that it is an eight-year average of the fund's investments, measured against relevant benchmarks. The relevant benchmarks named in the regulations are mostly indexes created by two giant global investment firms, the FTSE and the MSCI. Both are massive cogs in the global financial system and have become enormously powerful in the wake of the GFC. The indexes and their creators are anything but unvested, apolitical or free from corruption. If nothing else, the Australian super system, and industry super in particular, has provided a store of patient capital in a world that is trying to flip returns at an ever faster rate. But, instead of trusting the existing long-term investment approach for a retirement savings system that spans a person's working life, this bill will force Australian funds to follow the rest of the herd, including straight over the edge of whatever cliff the London and New York index fund managers might lead them to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, schedule 3 seeks to require super trustees to make decisions not just in the best interests of members but in the best financial interests of members. This one is not half cooked or half baked; it is simply and purely bad legislation. Even with the government's amendment to knock out the investment kill switch, this one is an absolute shocker. To start with, it's in direct contradiction to the royal commission. Are we starting to see a pattern of ignoring royal commission recommendations emerge here from the Liberal and National parties? Yes, we certainly are. As usual, Commissioner Hayne was abundantly clear about his findings. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I consider that the existing rules, especially the best interests covenant and the sole purpose test, set the necessary standards. Those standards should be applied according to their terms and—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">this is the important bit—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">without more specific elaboration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember, this government didn't want the banking royal commission to start with and, to be frank, it's not really interested in its recommendations. The inclusion of the word 'financial' in the best interests duty implies that money is all that matters. Just how this will affect a super fund's decision to make investment decisions on a moral basis is unclear. For example, could a fund choose not to invest in tobacco or arms manufacturing or fossil fuels, or, if it does so, are trustees then liable for civil penalties? The bill also reverses the onus of proof in civil proceedings against a trustee. If APRA were to decide that a trustee wasn't acting in the best financial interests of the fund's members, the trustee then has to prove that they were. This is bad legislation, and it could have significant impacts on ethical investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill continues the time-honoured tradition of the Liberals doing whatever they can to funnel money towards the rent-seekers in the financial system. This government positively detests that not-for-profit industry super funds, with worker and employer representatives on the board, have been successful and are now seen as the natural managers of the country's retirement savings. But they can't go at it head on, so they have to try and undermine the whole system with bills like this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this bill introduces a bodgie way to get rid of duplicate accounts. It puts investment management in the hands of global indexes and it outlaws impact investing or any other decision by a fund that is not purely for the greatest financial gain. Senators will have heard this saying before: a person who knows the price of everything, but the value of nothing—</span>

                    </a>  Thank you. That was, indeed, Oscar Wilde. I was paraphrasing there, I hasten to add. But the point here is that there is more to life than money. I've made choices in my superannuation, whereby I know that my retirement savings are going into things that I support and are not going into things like arms trafficking or tobacco sales or fossil fuels and a range of other things that I don't want my superannuation going into. That is actually freedom of choice, and here we have the government trying to take it away and trying to say that a super fund has to manage funds only in the best 'financial' interests. Well, I don't want my super managed that way. I want my super to be managed in an ethical way so that my investments are made into ethical products that help drive the transition out of fossil fuels, rather than continue to invest in them.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:53</span>):  I simply make the point that superannuation is the greatest bet that Australia has ever made in terms of forcing people to put almost 10 per cent of their salaries and wages into a scheme for the past 30 years which has not worked. This is a scheme that was created by ideology without any proper framework for its success, and here we are 30 years later with a scheme that costs more than it saves, a scheme that will never return a net positive position to the budget and a scheme that, in 2050, will still have almost every Australian on the pension. This is a failed scheme. It was put in place by ideologues 30 years ago. In fact, I'll quote the Treasury official, Paul Tilley, who wrote a history of the Treasury department, in which he said, 'In the early 1990s, Treasury was not actually well equipped to do the necessary long-term work and that the modelling done for super was done on the back of an envelope, which was subsequently thrown out and lost to history.' The whole thing was created without a framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That means that, 30 years later, we are coming in with a proposal to try and put a proper framework in place so that the scheme will actually work, because we're not wreckers on our side. We believe this idea could work for Australia and for Australian workers, and we want to fix it. We don't want to throw it in the bin. So the Your Future, Your Super bill is really all about putting that proper framework in place. It's not just me saying that the system is broken. This is the advice of the independent people like Grattan, Treasury and Choice. They're all saying that it's broken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem with this debate—and it's been very good to come in and hear some of the contributions already—is that almost everyone who has a view about super is conflicted. They have been bought out and owned by the wall of money which is super. This is a scheme that receives $100 billion of workers' money each and every year. They open the door and the money just pours in, and they take out $30 billion in fees every year. A hundred billion dollars comes in and $30 billion comes out in fees. With that money, they buy power and influence. They buy power and influence in the financial sector, in the union sector and in employer groups. We saw this week the Ai Group, which has received $1 million from AustralianSuper in the past year, disgustingly come out and defend the system without even declaring their conflict. So it shows that the big super industry can buy anyone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not about sectoral gains. It's not about comparing the finance sector or the union sector or whatever. This is about Australian workers getting the best possible value for their own money. Of course, we are heavily invested in this scheme as taxpayers, as people and as citizens. This scheme is costing the budget $40 billion a year in forgone income tax revenue. So we actually want the scheme to work. Otherwise, it is, as I say, the biggest bet we've ever made that has no prospect of ever really paying off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this bill is a really important structural change. It will improve the system. It will do three things: it will put in place a stapling regime so that people have one super fund for life unless they choose to do something else; it will put in place a best financial interests test which will stop the waste and the rot; and, thirdly, it will put in place what should have been there 30 years ago, performance testing. For 30 years, these people have been able to take our money and do whatever they want with it—all the funds—and they have spent our money very poorly.</span>

                    </a>  In terms of the single default, what I would say is that the modern workforce is very different to the workforce of 1992, yet we are stuck with a rigid system from 30 years ago which basically assumes that you work for 30 or 40 years and you're retired for a few years. Now we have an economy where people are working multiple jobs and can work flexibly. Obviously, the advent of the gig economy has created more opportunities than were there in the past. So what this system will do is ensure that there is only one default fund for each Australian worker unless they choose to do something else. From 1 July this year, employers will have to pay into the worker's default fund. That is their fund, and that is the fund that they will have until they choose a different one. People have been concerned about the burden on employers. Employers have reported that they can do this. Because of the advent of straight-through processing, this is apparently quite an easy thing for employers to do through the ATO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have about 100 default funds today. People have said, 'Jeez, wouldn't it be bad if we had 10 big industry funds?' Would I be worried about that? No, I wouldn't be worried about it, because I have a view that, the more people have in super and the better the system is, the easier it will be to engage with. People will decide to do something else. We shouldn't be trapped into this mindset that the whole thing has to be designed for the default person, for the disengaged person. I know that suits the Labor Party and the Greens, who like people to be disengaged from their own money so they can basically take the money from the black box, as they've done for 30 years. In the last year, $30 billion in fees has come out of the super system, and there's been another $20 million paid to unions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Very few people come to this debate with clean hands. I have worked inside the system. I have seen how broken it is. I have seen how crooked it is—and it is crooked. The whole idea of the Labor Party defending the position that people should have multiple accounts is disgusting. Multiple accounts means twice the fees and it means lower returns. But do you know what it means for the Labor Party and their mates—the unions? It means more money and more fees. That is why they are defending it. Who would have thought that the party that proclaims to stand for the workers is wanting to defend a system which takes away the workers' money—because, of course, they have to pay double the fees? The whole idea of this is to say that you have one fund. It doesn't matter whether it is a retail fund, an industry fund or whatever; that is your fund. You can choose a different fund—that's fine; we all believe in choice—but that is the backstop that we have. I should say that $2.6 billion a year is lost through multiple accounts. I know that's a lot of union subs. I know that union membership has fallen down to 10 per cent and this is how unions are keeping afloat—but it is really not appropriate. So don't forget: $30 billion a year in fees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The performance testing should have been a feature of the system. The fact that there have been so many poor-performing funds over the last 30 years really is an embarrassment to all of us. I think we all share a collective blame there. We shouldn't be compelling people to put their money into a scheme that isn't working. Where people have been able to get great returns, fabulous—that's great, and we want more people to get that. But there have been serial underperformers. As far as I can see, the bulk of these have been in the retail sector. These are not funds that should be able to receive compulsory contributions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an outsourced pension scheme. People sit in here and talk about the liberties of the superannuation scheme. Give me a break! This is a compulsory scheme. The only reason the system exists is because of Canberra. This is not the free market in operation; this is a compulsory pension scheme which doesn't work. So I think the underperformance test is a good idea. I know there are different views about whether or not the metrics are right. For the record, my view is that it should be simple, clean and comparable. People need to be able to see that the calculation that has been done on their fund is fair, reasonable and comparable. The way that is to be done is obviously through the regulations. People know that. It's not in the bill. What the bill sets up is the framework to assess super funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it unfathomable that people would come into this chamber and argue against the principle of being tested. What are people afraid of? We are making people put their money into these locked boxes. They should be tested. They should be the best possible funds. If they can't perform, if they can't even meet their own benchmark, they shouldn't be taking compulsory contributions. And lest we forget: these are the same people, largely, who come in here every day running the lines from the super funds. They can't think for themselves. If you watch them tonight, they will read all their speeches. It really is pathetic. Last year, as Australia faced the greatest economic shock in 100 years, those opposite were saying that people shouldn't be able to have access to their super in an emergency—that people couldn't have access to their own money; that they couldn't be trusted to touch their own money. Such is the depth that the Labor Party, the unions and co will go to defend their financial benefactors and the super funds.</span>

The regulations will be made by the minister and, like everything else in this place where I've had an opportunity to make a contribution—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator BRAGG:</span>
                    </a>  I don't think that the regulator should be making these regulations. It's important that ministers who are accountable to this chamber make the regulations and that they can be disallowed. That is yet to be established. But they must be comparable, they must be easy to understand and it must be easy for workers and members to compare super funds. This performance testing, which Labor and the unions are so afraid of, will be an important feature, I think, going forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's finish on the point about the best financial interest duty. Again, Labor doesn't want super funds to work in the interests of workers, which is just extraordinary. Around $100 billion a year flows into the funds, of which $30 billion comes out in fees. By 2030, $30 million will be paid to the unions. This is the cash cow for the unions, and they're all here, all the union people who have been appointed to the Senate to defend the union interests. It really is pathetic. I reserve my criticism for the directors as well and for the employer groups that have got their snouts in the trough. Super is the best thing they ever invented, because it keeps them all alive. There's no other purpose for employer groups and unions, and the banks have been just as bad. They have been proven by the Hayne royal commission to have had their snouts in the trough and to have too often put the interests of shareholders before those of members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the words that Labor don't want to hear, but the fact is that the whole system has underperformed. It is a system that should have had more safeguards to protect workers and to protect people's money, but that wasn't done by the Labor Party at the time because they were so desperate to hand over the cash to the unions and the banks. That's what Keating does; that's why Keating is still so defensive about this scheme. He comes out and attacks common old backbenchers, which is a sign of his defensiveness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This scheme is not working and we want to try to get it on track. The best financial interest duty is the centrepiece of this bill, and my view is that reversing the onus, to make sure the trustees can demonstrate that the money that they're paying to the unions, or for directors' fees, or for advertising, or for political donations, or to the banks or related parties, is in the members' interests. They have to prove that, otherwise why are they doing it? Now that is reasonable. There will be record-keeping arrangements put in place, and APRA will have to enforce this law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say again, for the record, that it's regrettable that we need to put a new, tougher fiduciary-style duty in place. There is already a best interest duty and there is already a sole-purpose test, but, as we've seen from Senate estimates, APRA has presided over a system which has allowed workers' money to be stolen by the super funds, the banks and the industry funds, and that is wrong. So, yes, the best financial interest duty will clarify. It will tidy up. The trustees, collectively and individually, will know that they can no longer take away the workers' money and waste it on union boondoggles or send it off to the banks. They can't do it anymore. But APRA will have to enforce that law vigorously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this bill passes this chamber, I will make it my personal objective to ensure that this law is properly enforced, because we've had 30 years of just wasting money. Who could imagine a scheme that was concocted 30 years ago in Canberra—whose modelling was thrown out because it was done on a coaster, a scheme that was done without a framework, without a proper objective in place—could be a scheme that has taken 10 per cent of people's wages, that has no prospect of ever becoming net positive to budget, no prospect of ever getting most people off the pension and, if Labor had their way, no prospect of ever really getting the fees down?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the only plan to fix super is this plan. It's the only plan. Today we see the end of Labor's policy integrity. They are now only a party of vested interests defending the tired old union movement, and I cannot wait to hear the pathetic contributions in all the speeches that are to be read tonight.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:11</span>):  Well, is there anything that the Liberal and National parties hate more than superannuation? It really is hard to think of anything that Liberal Party and National Party members of parliament and senators hate more than superannuation. And why? Because superannuation is about looking after workers, and that's what the Liberal and National parties have against superannuation. They don't want average workers to benefit from the kind of retirement that all of them will enjoy for the rest of their lives—especially those who, as Senator Sterle was talking about, were born with a silver spoon in their mouth. They're all fine. But average workers? No, they can't have a dignified retirement. They can't live comfortably in their retirement. They should go back to the old system before superannuation was invented by Labor and have to struggle through poverty in their retirement—that's what the Liberals and Nationals want for workers.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you need any proof of that, just have a look at the history of superannuation in this country. When Labor created superannuation, the Liberals and the Nationals opposed it, and, pretty much every year since, they've launched attack after attack on our superannuation system, which is designed to give working people in this country a dignified retirement. Every time it has been legislated to increase, the Liberals and the Nationals come after it. We've seen that debate play out over the last 12 months or so, with all these Liberal backbenchers saying that we shouldn't have an increase in super and inventing ways for superannuation to be raided, and it's all because they want to launch attack after attack on superannuation.</span>

They're just the latest salvo in the ongoing war of the Liberal Party and National Party against superannuation and against working people in this country.</span>

Senator Hanson, I hope you're watching what I've got to say, because you're going to be called out, once and for all, for the selfish fraud whose snout is in the trough that you are and you have always been.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Madam Deputy President Fierravanti-Wells. In my remaining remarks I want to focus on what Senator Hanson is up to in this debate and in this bill. Let's remember that it was Senator Hanson who provided the votes to this government only an hour or two ago to rush this legislation through and make sure that we dealt with it tonight when the program didn't have that happening. Why is Senator Hanson in such a rush to get this legislation dealt with that it has to be dealt with in a late-night sitting of the Senate tonight? What on earth could Senator Hanson be so interested in about this legislation? Let's have a look.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see here from Senator Hanson through this debate and through an amendment she's moving is probably the biggest personal rort I have ever seen in federal politics. That's what we're seeing in this legislation and in the amendment that Senator Hanson is moving. A lot of people haven't noticed this yet because it was just snuck in late today. Senator Hanson, on behalf of Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party, is moving amendments listed on sheet No. 8983. You actually have to understand a little about superannuation to understand exactly what Senator Hanson is trying to do with this amendment. It's all worded in very technical language about concessional contributions caps, dollar figures, years and things like that. But let's be very clear about what Senator Hanson is trying to do by moving this amendment right here. What Senator Hanson is trying to do by moving this amendment is to give herself a $30,000 pay rise over the next six years that she hopes to be in this parliament. That's right—$30,000 will go to Senator Hanson if this amendment that she has moved gets through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why does it only affect Senator Hanson? Because she has drafted this in a way that only benefits her and a very small number of other people in this chamber—or, in fact, in this country. This amendment will basically change the concessional rate of superannuation only for high-income earners—only for people who earn roughly $250,000 a year or thereabouts. What kinds of people in this country earn $250,000 a year or so? Oh, it might be senators! We happen to be very well-paid people, and Senator Hanson is one of those people. So this won't benefit a single battler in Queensland, who she says—the fraud that she is—that she's in Canberra to defend. It won't benefit anyone in Mundubbera, it won't benefit anyone in Gayndah, it won't benefit anyone in Eidsvold and it won't benefit anyone in Toowoomba or anywhere else in regional Queensland who is struggling to get ahead with no wage rises year after year. But, my golly, it's going to benefit Senator Hanson. Senator Hanson is going to get a $30,000 pay rise as a result of an amendment that she is moving. She put this to the government. This isn't some government engineered plan; this is something that has Senator Hanson's name on it because she wants the $30,000 pay rise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the way it's going to be done is by changing the superannuation concessional contributions regime in a way that only benefits high-income earners. So she has herself in there, in the first instance, by being a high-income earner, but it gets better—it gets better! This benefit, this pay rise, will only be given to people who are aged 67 or over. Now why would you pick that year? Why would it be 67 and not 66, not 65, not 64, not 69, not 70 and not 71? Why would it be 67? Well, who knew? How old is Senator Hanson? She's 67! How about that! So Senator Hanson is moving an amendment to give high-income earners like her a $30,000 pay rise over the six-year term that she would serve in this parliament—but only if they're 67.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I might look pretty old but I'm not 67. There aren't many people in here who are 67, but Senator Hanson is 67 and the beauty of this amendment which she's trying to move is that she won't only get a pay rise for one year she'll get it the next year and the one after that, the one after that and the one after that. In the first year she'll get a $1,500 pay rise; in the second year she'll get a $3,000 pay rise; in the third year, $4½ thousand; in the fourth year, $6,000; in the fifth year, $7½ thousand; and, again, $7½ thousand in year 6. All up, over six years, Senator Hanson stands to gain a $30,000 pay rise that won't apply to anyone who is under 67. But it just so happens that people who are 67 or older—maybe like Senator Hanson—will get a $30,000 pay rise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know about Senator Polley, I don't know about Senator Sterle, I don't know about Senator Urquhart and, to be fair, I don't know about members in the Liberal and National parties, but I did not get elected to come down and serve the battlers of Queensland by giving myself a pay rise. But it's very clear that that's why Senator Hanson is here. I've had a gutful of Senator Hanson running around Central Queensland and regional Queensland saying that she's for the battlers and then coming down here and, time after time, voting against battlers and voting to make it harder for coalminers who are working as labour hire as casuals. And now she's giving herself a nice $30,000 pay rise. That's not why I got elected, that's not why any Labor senator got elected and I doubt that's why many people from other parties got elected. But it is certainly why Senator Hanson got herself elected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People have known for a long time that, when Senator Hanson says that she comes to Canberra to help battlers, what she really means is she comes here to help herself. We have seen over the years—and this goes back to her days well before I was in this chamber—that Senator Hanson invented and got the practice of rorting electoral funds down to an art form. Now what she is doing with this amendment is trying to rort taxpayers' funds for own personal benefit, to give her a pay rise. It is a disgrace. Senator Hanson should be ashamed of what she is doing. Senator Hanson should apologise to every single battler in Queensland who she has tricked into thinking she is here for them when she is actually here to give herself a nice big pay rise. No other member of this chamber would treat battlers or Australians with such contempt. Senator Hanson has finally been caught out doing what many of us have known she has been about for a very long time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The worst part is that this is all part of a dodgy deal that Senator Hanson has done with the government to get this legislation through. Senator Hanson, as I say, is the coalition's best friend here in Canberra. She lines up with them time and time again. They can always count on her vote, no matter what they want to do, whether they are coming after pensioners, workers or penalty rates. And now she will vote to give herself another big pay rise. This is yet another dodgy deal between the Liberal-National government and Pauline Hanson to rush legislation through and, this time, to give Pauline Hanson a personal pay rise of $30,000. It is a disgrace. Senator Hanson should be ashamed of herself. Senator Roberts should be ashamed of himself. If any government senator votes with Senator Hanson on this amendment, they should be ashamed of themselves as well. Those of us from Queensland should go back home and justify to Queensland battlers why they are voting to give Senator Pauline Hanson a $30,000 pay rise. It is a disgrace.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:22</span>):  I'm pleased to speak in favour of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Your Future, Your Super) Bill 2021 and related bills before us tonight. Senators in this place will know, or should know by now after my having served in this place for two years, that I do not adopt a doctrinaire or ideological approach to the concept of superannuation—far from it. I absolutely do not. Every single Australian worker in this country should expect in a country as wealthy as ours to enjoy a comfortable retirement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Personally, I'm actually a member of an industry super fund, AustralianSuper. I'm a very happy member of AustralianSuper. They have given me a very good return over a number of years, and I thank Ian Silk and his team. They have absolutely done a great job. I have absolutely no ideological conflict in relation to the concept of superannuation. Every single worker in this country, in a country as wealthy as ours, should have a reasonable expectation for a comfortable retirement. That's important. It's an important equity for this country, absolutely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, I want to take three points in relation to this legislation. Senator McKim—and I always listen very carefully to Senator McKim when he speaks—spoke about the issue of ethical investment funds as opposed to other investment funds. The reality is—and I expect that Senator McKim is aware of this—that quite often ethical investment funds actually outperform other investment funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberIInterjecting">Senator McKim interjecting</span>—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282997" type="MemberContinuation">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator SCARR:</span>
                    </a>  Exactly, Senator McKim. You are aware of it. I thought you would be. Hence the best financial interest test should instil no fear whatsoever in investors who want to invest in ethical investment funds. In fact, perhaps the converse is true.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to that, I want to quote some research which Morningstar, a very reputable organisation, conducted that was reported in that extreme right-wing newspaper called <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span>—that's sarcasm, for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> record—under the heading 'Ethical investments are outperforming traditional funds'. Morningstar compared 745 ethical investment funds against 4,150 traditional funds. They found:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Over 10 years, the average annual return for a sustainable fund invested in large global companies has been 6.9% a year, while a traditionally invested fund has made 6.3% a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what the evidence suggests. So, as opposed to the rhetoric, when we look at the evidence, those Australians who, as a matter of principle but also as a matter of prudent investment, want to invest in ethical investment funds have absolutely nothing to fear whatsoever from the introduction of a best financial interest test. There is nothing controversial about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point I want to make is in relation to this concept of a single default fund. Senator McKim again made a very good point—that many Australians do not spend a lot of time reflecting on their superannuation. Too many Australians in this country have too many funds. Instead of having one superannuation account in order to minimise fees and charges, they have multiple accounts. Many times they are not even aware of the multiple funds they have, and many times those workers who have multiple funds are our most vulnerable workers. They're in transient employment; they're not long-term employees of a single employer. So we need to do everything we possibly can to promote the notion that the most prudent and efficient retirement strategy is to have one superannuation fund, to minimise the fees and charges which are taken from the fund. The scheme which is established through this legislation is, again, hardly controversial. Unless you exercise your choice as an employee, your one default fund follows you from job to job. If you choose to change your superannuation fund, then that's your right; you can change your superannuation fund. That is entirely reasonable, and hardly an ideological argument.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My third point is underperformance. The reality is that the evidence is indisputable that there are a number of underperforming funds. As Senator McKim said, too many Australians aren't focused on the performance of their superannuation funds. Perhaps over the last 18 months or so they have been more focused on it. We need to do something to protect workers, to protect all Australians, whose retirement is going to be materially impacted if they are participating in underperforming superannuation funds. That's the third pillar of the reforms introduced by this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, I'm absolutely no ideologue in relation to superannuation. I want every single Australian to have the opportunity to retire in comfort. There are lots of great people from both the employer side and the employee side involved in industry superannuation funds. I think we can make the system better so that it works better for workers and for all Australians, so that we can provide a better retirement for Australians who work so hard during the course of their lives.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:28</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Your Future, Your Super) Bill 2021 and associated bills. Australia's income retirement system is the envy of the rest of the world, as a great legacy of the Keating government. Compulsory superannuation has seen a $3 trillion nest egg grow. These savings provide a boost to our national economy. They can go into infrastructure investment, which can go into strengthening our national sovereignty. That is something that should be applauded and celebrated by those opposite. Instead of that, we have this ill-conceived legislation before the Senate. We know that a dirty deal was done today. We heard from Senator Watt that the vested interest of Senator Hanson has been on full display, so I can't wait to hear her contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals have never believed in universal super. They opposed it at the beginning, and they continue to undermine it each and every chance that they get. This bill implements the government's 2021 budget measure Your Future, Your Super. The government claims these measures will enhance the performance of superannuation funds and reduce the number of duplicate accounts in the system. We welcome the government's late commitment to action on serious issues such as multiple accounts and underperforming superannuation funds. However, this bill, as written, will not deliver better outcomes for Australian superannuation members. The evidence provided to the inquiry on this legislation makes it clear that the government's proposed approach to superannuation would damage retirement outcomes for ordinary Australians and subject our superannuation system to considerable risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They may have removed some elements of this bill, but we still cannot accept this legislation. The first schedule introduces a new system for stapling individual members to a single superannuation account, replacing the existing industrially determined superannuation default account system for any member who has a previous existing super account. The retail super funds are happy with this bill, as they usually get people first when they're 16 and in their first jobs. However, this could have unwarranted consequences. It could staple members to an underperforming fund, or it could mean that some employees will not receive insurance appropriate to their profession.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second element of this bill introduces a new measure that will assess the performance of certain superannuation funds against benchmarks determined by the regulations and prevent funds that fail to meet those benchmarks from accepting new members. Labor strongly supports the implementation of a performance measure. However, the proposed measure in schedule 2 is significantly flawed. Some stakeholders have indicated that the government's proposed performance measures could reward underperforming funds, incentivise funds to increase administration fees or drive investment away from Australia's unlisted assets. The bill also ignores admin fees in the performance benchmarks. It just ignores them. It gives a green light to bad funds to increase their administration charges at the expense of members' accumulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's proposed benchmarks for its performance measures may actively penalise funds for investing in unlisted Australian assets, such as venture capital, private equity or infrastructure assets. These indexes will risk local investment. I can't emphasise that enough: this bill will put at risk local investment and, with it, local jobs and wages. So not only are they not doing anything in this bill that is really going to be beneficial for ordinary Australians but they are, in fact, putting at risk local investment, local jobs and wages. Does that sound familiar? I think it does to Senator Urquhart and Senator Brown, because it's in the Liberals' DNA. Whenever they can have a go at superannuation, that's where they'll be: first in line to have a go. If there's an opportunity to have a go at ordinary workers, again this government will be first in line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Research from the Conexus Institute demonstrates that, if trustees of super funds design portfolios to explicitly account for Your Future, Your Super performance tests, many funds would need to significantly alter their investment strategy. The results of this research highlight the conflict trustees will face between managing for best member outcomes and prioritising the Your Future, Your Super performance test. David Bell, Executive Director of the Conexus Institute, has claimed:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If trustees continue with their current investment strategy, they expose themselves to a reasonable likelihood of failing the performance test at some point, simply through the short-term randomness of returns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These trustees would also face the prospect of having to modify their investment strategy in response to short-term performance, creating transaction costs while inadvertently reducing their ability to invest for the long-term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, we do support performance measures, but, while the performance mechanisms proposed in schedule 2 will prevent new members from joining underperforming funds, they do nothing to assist members already in underperforming funds. It is pretty important, I would have thought, to protect those people as well. According to Treasury, this affects up to three million Australians and could potentially cost Australians tens of thousands of dollars in retirement savings. So they're putting at risk local investment, local jobs and local wages for Australian workers, and it could potentially cost Australian workers tens of thousands of dollars in retirement savings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third measure introduces a requirement that super fund trustees must act in the best financial interests of members, as opposed to the current requirement, which merely asks that they act in the best interests of members. Labor thinks superannuation trustees must also act in the best interests of their members, not the best interests of parent entities. We are glad that the government removed the regulatory kill switch from the bill, but there is still significant government overreach in the form of consequences for performance tests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures proposed by the Morrison government are seriously flawed, and much of the detail has been left to regulations, which is becoming a habit of this government. Senator Carr, I and others have spoken about that numerous times in this chamber. This government is prone to leaving everything to regulation. I might add, by the way, that these are regulations which have not been finalised or set. Who knows what's actually going to be included? That is why you need to always read the fine print or look into what isn't in the bill, because this government cannot be trusted when it comes to superannuation and protecting Australian workers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are also limiting coverage of measures. The performance measures proposed do not extend to all choice products and will initially cover only MySuper products. The vast majority of underperforming funds are concentrated in the choice sector.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's bill will take effect from 1 July 2021, requiring Australian employers to scramble to implement the new system in less than a month. That is why Labor will be moving a series of amendments to fix the bill. We are not here to sink it. We're here to fix it, which is what we find we have to do on countless pieces of legislation. This is critical legislation and it must be fixed. But, if the government can't accept these simple fixes, we'll protect the interests of Australian workers by voting this poorly drafted bill down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is abundantly clear that the Liberals cannot be trusted with superannuation. They wanted to allow Australians to have early access to their super accounts so they could buy a house, a nonsensical idea as the supply of housing is relatively inelastic, meaning that, if you increase the demand for housing by allowing people early access to super, it will only drive up the cost. We must address the housing affordability crisis in Australia, but it must be done by addressing supply-side shortages. This is just basic economics 101.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite also allowed Australians to raid their super funds during the pandemic instead of giving them timely access to support. This meant that people were robbing their own futures when we should be encouraging people to put more money into their superannuation. We now have 600,000 people who will be left with zero—zero!—in their superannuation fund account, because the government refused to provide them with other support. People in casual work, and in particular young people, were encouraged to take money out of their superannuation because of the compound interest. It will have a large, negative impact on their retirement income. Not only that, but it will also make a significant difference to our national economy, placing a greater burden on future budgets. Added to that, the number of people who accessed their super was twice what was predicted. It begs the question: was this responsible policy? Did anyone access their super who didn't need to, or were they not properly informed of the consequences of early withdrawal? These are very basic questions that I don't believe were put to people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wages have effectively been frozen for eight years under the Liberal government, and, as was revealed in the budget, over the next four years they're going to go down. Yet what is the government's argument about superannuation and wages? The Liberals seem to have had no problem suppressing our economy with their own inaction during the last eight years. We have had stagnant wages, and at the same time those opposite have held off and broken commitments they took to the 2013, 2016 and 2019 elections—that is, they would not freeze super. We are now on the eve of the next federal election, but we know that they're opposed to the increase of superannuation up to 12 per cent—a measure that would place less of a burden on future taxpayers to fund Australians in retirement. Let's be realistic. The Morrison government, this Liberal government, are not interested in improving outcomes for Australian superannuation members. They're interested only in their own political advancement at the cost of the national economy. We know the Prime Minister is only interested in one job, and that's his own job. He reinforces that day in, day out with his broken promises and his loose-with-the-truth comments that he makes and commitments that he gives to the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Superannuation was delivered by the Keating government, by a Labor government, to give ordinary Australians the benefit of professional management of their money. It's important to ensure quality of life in retirement, to support the national economy into the future, and it is a legacy that I am very proud of. I am very proud of superannuation and a great defender of it, because we already know that women in this country will not retire on the same money as our male colleagues. They're not going to have the same retirement. We will always speak up and we will always work for a better, a decent retirement for all Australians. We will fight tooth and nail because it's in the best interests of all Australians to have a dignified retirement where they will no longer have to rely on future budgets and future taxpayers to fund pensions going forward. This government, instead of making changes that are going to be beneficial and encouraging people to put more money in their super, is out to attack superannuation and ordinary everyday Australian workers. It's in their DNA. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="F49" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:46</span>):  I rise to make a contribution this evening in the cognate debate, but I would like to make my remarks specifically on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Your Future, Your Super) Bill 2021. As everyone in this parliament and in communities throughout Australia would know, Labor built the superannuation system in this country. It is a proud legacy of Labor. It is a system which seeks to ensure that hardworking Australians can have a decent retirement, but it also provides a huge national saving pool that can be reinvested in our economy to provide jobs and incomes to workers today. It's a system which does need constant improvement to maximise returns for workers, the fund contributors. One obvious improvement would be to increase the superannuation guarantee over time and as originally intended. However, sadly, as we are all acutely aware in this place, it is successive Liberal governments that have sought to stymie this long overdue increase: first the Howard government, then the Abbott government, then the Turnbull government and now the Morrison government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time the Liberals try to tinker with the superannuation system in this country, they seek to do so not to improve outcomes for workers—not in the best interests of working people, their jobs and their life after paid work—but rather with vested interests at heart. Ultimately, their proposed solutions lead to worse retirement outcomes for workers, because, when reasonable suggestions are put forward to fix clearly inherent flaws in their legislation, they reject them. This is what we are seeing here yet again this evening. It is the Liberal Party returning to type. True to form, they are going after the hip pockets of working people and undermining the strength of the superannuation system, set up to provide for workers' retirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that these bills in the cognate debate we're having here today—but specifically this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Your Future, Your Super) Bill 2021—have many flaws. Many of these problems were identified through the inquiry into the bill by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics. In a dissenting report on the bill, Labor senators outlined in detail the reservations that we on this side of the chamber have with this bill. There are a great many flaws in this legislation, and many of them with the potential to cause significant harm—harm, in a broader sense, to the Australian economy and, more specifically, harm to superannuation fund member right across Australia. Put simply, that means harm to working people and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why Labor cannot support the bill in its current form. We have put forward in good faith to the government that they need to review and reconsider the issues that have been raised directly with them and canvassed through the Senate Standing Committee on Economics in the inquiry on the bill so that the bill can be improved and actually deliver on the stated intent. Only after the legislation has been revised and amended should the bill be returned to parliament. In its current form it simply is not good enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's consider some of the serious flaws that were identified through the inquiry process. Firstly, there's the political override power. This bill includes an extraordinary power that would allow the Treasurer to personally override any investment decision or payment decision made by a superannuation trustee. Why? How could this possibly be necessary? It's an absolute overreach. It clearly goes too far, and it must be reconsidered or knocked out in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's come to the provisions on stapling to underperforming funds. The implementation of the stapling mechanism would cause up to three million Australians to be stapled to underperforming funds. How can that be good for workers or fund contributors? In terms of stapling, we've heard that Your Future, Your Super, according to APRA, also contains many occupational exclusions. This is a really important point, because some of the most hazardous jobs are excluded from insurance coverage from particular superannuation funds. I will go through some of the occupations that we're talking about—some of the most hazardous occupations that need coverage that are excluded by some funds. This goes to the point that people need to be very careful about the fund that they join—which again goes to this stapling to underperforming funds and the fact that, according to APRA, three million Australians will be stapled to underperforming funds. Some of those commonly excluded occupations include boilermakers, bricklayers, carpenters, concreters, dogmen, fitter and turners, labourers, painters, plasterers, plumbers, electricians, riggers, scaffolders and welders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People may not be aware—those who are assigned to these super funds—that AMP, for example, have specific exclusions. At AMP, bricklayers, concreters, dogmen, labourers, plasterers, plumbers, those who work on roofs, electricians, electric linesmen, riggers and scaffolders cannot get total and permanent disability cover. They're totally excluded. At MLC the total and permanent disability cover completely excludes farm labourers and railway workers—they're excluded. So if you don't know that you're excluded then by stapling a worker who is new to a hazardous occupation to one of these funds—and I have to say that there are others—we'll see a member paying premiums for no cover: a fee for no service, if you like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in this place all know that the most serious and hazardous occupations are around the building industry. There are around 2.7 million people who work in the riskiest quintile of Australian occupations, which includes many of those I've already spoken about—there are miners as well—and there are over 34,000 new entries into the construction workforce annually. Many start out as apprentices, often well below the age of 25. Insurance is especially important for young blue-collar building and construction workers as they are more than twice as likely to require insurance than the general population of the same age. Today, only seven funds nationwide continue to offer default opt-out cover to under-25s. The government forced the rest to switch it off in 2020. That's what this government did—switched it off in 2020. It means that a hazardous occupation apprentice or young worker will not get default cover at particular funds. So this is a very important part of this legislation, and it goes too far. Clearly, it needs to be reconsidered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I was saying, the implementation of the stapling mechanism would cause up to three million Australians to be stapled to underperforming funds. Quite frankly, we all know that that cannot be good for workers or their funds—it can't. Put simply, up to three million Australians will be left worse off in retirement because of this provision. The whole point of making changes to super should be to improve the retirement incomes of workers, not worsen them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And what about the impact on insurance? As I've already mentioned, Australian workers in certain industries will be left without adequate insurance as a result of this bill. This will leave working people with less-than-adequate insurance coverage. It hardly sounds like an item on the tick list for a government that's genuine about improving the way that superannuation works for workers. And what about the bill's failure to cover all APRA regulated funds? This bill explicitly excludes up to one-third of all superannuation funds regulated by APRA from the performance measure. We know that the performance measure is critical to ensuring that funds always seek to get the best possible returns in their members' interests. Why should certain funds be excluded from this critical feature?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me to the flawed performance measure. Stakeholders have identified numerous flaws in the performance benchmarks originally proposed by the government, including the exclusion of administrative fees and the potential to discourage investment in Australian assets. There's no reason to exclude these basic fees. I would have thought that the very last thing the government should seek to do is to discourage reinvestment in our Australian assets. Notably, investment by funds here at home have added the benefit of growing our local economy and providing more jobs in our local communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And what about the administrative burden on funds included within this bill? The drafting of the proposed best financial interest duty provisions could place undue administrative costs on superannuation funds, which will be passed on to members in the form of higher costs. That's a big cross: higher costs to members equal lower returns on investment. It's the wrong way: go back and redraft it. But, no, not this government. And, of course, there's the administrative burden on employers imposed by the start date of this bill, 1 July. It could have significant impacts on employers, who will be required to implement changes to payroll processes in an extremely short period of time. This is another flaw which could be easily fixed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issues identified by Labor senators in the dissenting report are not only issues identified by stakeholders in relation to the bill; many of these issues have been identified in chapter 2 of the chair's report on the bill. It is for these reasons and more that Labor believe this bill is in need of a serious rewrite. Improving superannuation for fund members is the objective of the bill. I will just say that again: improving superannuation outcomes for fund members is the objective of the bill. Labor support that objective. We always have and always will. But we cannot support a bill which fundamentally and manifestly fails to deliver on that objective without needed improvements to address these serious concerns. I just want to say again that Labor support any move to improve superannuation outcomes for fund members, as is the stated objective of this bill. That is, as I've said, what we always have done. But of course this bill does not do that. It won't deliver on that objective—not without serious improvements to address these serious issues that have been raised by Labor.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:01</span>):  I just want to make a point, first of all, on some comments that were made by Senator Bragg. Isn't it amazing that he had the hide to stand here in this parliament and have a go at the banks? He said the banks are part of the problem, except the Treasury Laws Amendment (Your Future, Your Super) Bill doesn't deal with the retail banks. He says the banks need to be held to account. But this bill doesn't make them accountable. In actual fact, it clearly makes them unaccountable. I describe Senator Bragg as a modern Liberal defender and protector of all things commercial, unless it involves content disagreements with people like the ABC. He disagrees with them. He disagrees with making sure retail super funds are held to account. He is all things commercial whilst he is running a defence line for the retail funds. But look at Senator Bragg's track record: he happily delivered the keynote speech at the 2020 FinTech Awards when the top gong was given to a payday lender, Beforepay, that charges only five per cent to lend up to $200 for a week, the equivalent of a 260 per cent annual interest rate! It says it all, doesn't it?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Bragg touched on the important area of the reverse onus of proof. You don't have to go into all the legal details of reverse onus of proof except to simply say that in the Your Future, Your Super Senate inquiry the department highlighted that the only significant areas where there's reverse onus on proof other than superannuation funds that are not run for profit are Australians accused of being paedophiles overseas. They have a reverse onus overseas. Terrorists have a reverse onus of proof. So now we have industry funds that have some of the most prominent businesses and employer organisations in the country and—heaven forbid!—worker representatives with equal numbers on the board that all now have a reverse onus of proof, just like paedophiles and terrorists. Doesn't that say it all about Senator Bragg highlighting that point?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has landed on a strategy for how it can attempt to pass woeful legislation through this parliament. The government serves up an abysmal bill. It's opposed by all corners of the Australian parliament—even by members of the Prime Minister's own coalition. The government is then forced to axe some of the most offensive parts of its bill. And then the Prime Minister sees if he can squeeze through the unpalatable leftovers!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government tried to exclude administration fees from performance testing,  and the Prime Minister was forced to backflip. The Morrison government served up benchmarking, which would have disincentivised investment in regional Australia—and the Prime Minister was forced to backflip. Then the Morrison government attempted to give the Treasurer the power to cancel any investment by any super fund for any reason. And the Prime Minister was forced to backflip.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish I could say that that means the bill before us now is a sensible piece of legislation which addresses the actual issues in the superannuation sector, but it's not. First and foremost, this bill still contains a back door for the Treasurer of the day to create regulation to control what super funds can and can't invest in. They might be able to dupe the National Party, but they certainly can't dupe us. The power was supposed to have been removed from this bill in the House, but, if you read the fine print of the bill on page 30, schedule 3, part 1, section 10, it's all too clear. You'll see that super fund trustees will be forced to comply with any requirements prescribed by the regulation. This is a limitless power for the current Treasurer, and any future Treasurer, to take direct control over super fund investments. I'll come back to the sneaky attempt to back-door these powers a little bit later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to the Productivity Commission's 2018 inquiry into superannuation. It found two issues: unintended multiple accounts and entrenched underperformance were costing Australians $3.8 billion each year. Labor wants to address these problems. Industry super funds want to address these problems. Employers want to address these problems. Judging by this bill, the Morrison government doesn't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a bill with a very small constituency, but it's a constituency that is very important to this Prime Minister. Of course that's the constituency of the big banks. This is the Prime Minister who voted against a royal commission into banks on 26 separate occasions—the Prime Minister who, as Treasurer, referred to Labor's calls for a royal commission into the banks as 'a populist whinge'. That same Prime Minister has put forward a bill, supported only by the big banks, which leaves Australians worse off in retirement and worse off if they get injured at work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's examine this bill a little bit more closely. Schedule 1 will staple fund members to a single fund for life. The government is claiming this will address the issue of unintended multiple accounts. But, by not addressing underperformance first, it will mean that three million Australians will be stapled into underperforming funds at exorbitant fees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And who are the funds with eye-watering fees? Well, fortunately, APRA publishes data on the funds which slug members with the highest fees. And surprise, surprise! Nine of the 10 funds with the highest fees are for-profit retail superfunds—funds like AMP, Suncorp, Aon, Mercer, Colonial First State and Commonwealth Bank, the Prime Minister's old mates, who he worked so hard to protect from the royal commission. These are the sorts of funds that three million Australians will be stapled to if this bill proceeds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stapling will also be catastrophic for workers in high-risk industries who depend upon the insurance they receive through their industry super fund—workers like 25-year-old Andrew, who was crushed at work by two glass plates weighing more than 1.6 tonnes and suffered severe spinal injuries. Thanks to his Cbus insurance, he is recovering with the support of a financial safety net. Under this bill, if Andrew had opened his first super fund with his bank, or his hospitality fund, it would be very likely his policy would have explicitly excluded the occupation from coverage. He would've been left with nothing. How is stripping insurance from construction workers, truck drivers and frontline health workers a good policy? How is locking three million Australians into underperforming funds are good policy?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 is supposed to be addressing underperforming funds. Let's see how we go here. Again, this is something that Labor does support, but the actual provisions in this bill are woefully and deliberately inadequate. In 2012 the Gillard Labor government introduced the MySuper reforms. MySuper funds are simple, low-cost superannuation products that are suitable for the vast majority of Australians who do not want to actively manage their super investments. Non-MySuper products are commonly referred to as 'choice' products. If you read the whole way down to page 27 of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Your Future, Your Super) Bill, you'll see that the entire performance test schedule only applies to MySuper funds and some choice funds prescribed by regulation, which we now know from the draft regulations will only be trustee directed choice products. That leaves an entire third of super assets, $5.15 billion in exempt choice funds, excluded from performance testing. That's a $5.15 billion loophole. It's not an accidental loophole. It's intentionally written into the bill and into the regulations. So, why has the government excluded a third of the sector from performance testing? I think I know. Here is a quote from the Productivity Commission's report from its inquiry into superannuation:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… we found that about 36 per cent of choice products—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">that's the big retailers—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">in our sample, with about 15 per cent of assets, underperformed benchmarks tailored to their own asset allocation (in the 13 years to 2017). Almost all were offered by retail funds. This is likely to be a conservative estimate of underperformance in the whole choice segment …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission identified that, even by conservative estimates, these exempt choice products consistently underperformed and were almost exclusively retail funds offered by financial services companies like the big banks. So, of course—surprise, surprise, surprise—the Prime Minister who voted against the royal commission 26 times excluded them from performance testing. Here's another quote from the Productivity Commission report, and, again, this is the report the bill is supposed to be implementing:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the choice segment, poor comparability of products … the charging of fees for no service, the entrenched tail of high-fee products and persistent underperformance by some funds all point to an absence of healthy competition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have retail products that persistently underperform, charge high fees and charge fees for no service, and these are the products that the government has chosen to create a loophole for. I have an article that was published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> today titled 'Commonwealth Bank reaped superannuation profits even when fund members' balances fell'. Now, I'm sure this headline brings immense pleasure to the 'senator for financial services', Senator Bragg, because the article reads:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's biggest bank, the Commonwealth, reaped more than $1.4bn in profits from superannuation arm Colonial First State over four years that include periods when members of the funds it ran saw their balances shrink or stagnate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only part of the statement that would disappoint Senator Bragg and the Prime Minister is that it was only $1.4 billion. Under this bill, when these sorts of funds are exempt from performance testing, it will be easier than ever before for the big banks to milk Australian superannuation accounts dry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I'll go to schedule 3. As I said earlier, the government ditched this part of the bill, which explicitly gave the Treasurer the power to kill super fund investments. But, as always with this government, the devil is in the detail. You'll see that the bill changes the wording of one of the covenants in section 52(2)(c) of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. It omits 'best interests' and substitutes 'best financial interests', so that trustees must perform the trustees' duties and exercise the trustees' powers in the best 'financial' interests of the beneficiaries, and adds 'including complying with any requirements prescribed by the regulations for the purpose of this paragraph'. That gives the Treasurer of the day the power to set seemingly limitless requirements on funds through regulation. That could include what super funds can and can't invest in. I know that the member for New England and the member for Hughes were both particularly vocal in opposition to that power. I'm sure this back door to that same power would be of great concern to senators on all sides of this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will staple three million Australians into underperforming funds. This bill will strip vital tailored insurance away from workers in high-risk industries. This bill will create a $515 billion loophole for some of the worst-performing, highest-fee retail choice funds to operate outside of performance testing. This bill will create a back door for the very investment powers that were supposed to have been axed in the House. It's a bill that contradicts both the Productivity Commission and the banking royal commission and delivers a big payday for the Prime Minister's mates at the big banks, and it must be opposed.</span>

What has their answer been on low wages? Have they reflected on the institutional factors that have driven wages down—weaker collective bargaining, an anti-growth Fair Work Commission and no effort from this government to deal with wage theft? Oh, no. Have they dealt with the issues in the labour market that are dragging wages backwards—a growing guest worker economy and temporary workers being paid $9 an hour, which is particularly rampant in agriculture, as we've discovered over the last few weeks? Oh no; they haven't got a plan to deal with that. Do they have a strategy to deal with the dead hand on wages growth, reflected in their own public sector wages cap and the wages caps of governments at the state level, Labor and Liberal, around the country? Absolutely not. On the gender wages gap, there's crickets. You don't hear a thing from these jokers about dealing with the structural inequalities that mean that women's occupations in this country are paid less and valued less than men's. We have no answers from this government on aged care, no answers on disability care and no answers to deal with labour hire and casualisation. Oh no; that's too difficult.</span>

Indeed, the previous finance minister said that low wages were a deliberate design feature of their system. So what was the only suggestion that these pea-hearted characters on the other side could come up with? What could these superannuated, overpaid—$250,000 a year; well paid, like everybody across their parliament—characters come up with? That the wage increases of low-wage workers should be funded with cuts to legislated superannuation increases. That was the best that they could come up with—maybe $20 a week. If you followed the bouncing ball of their failed logic in their plan, the minister's plan—the plan of many on the backbench who go on with this stuff—it's maybe $20 a week; $80,000 less for people for their retirement incomes. So ordinary families—for the flawed ideology and failed approach of this government on wages and super—would have paid the penalty in a massive hit to their retirement incomes. And there is no plan for wages. So why would we—why would anyone in the country—believe that anything this government says on superannuation could be believed?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And then we come to today's performance, an utter shambles, utter chaos: a rabble of misanthropic, misinformed, out-of-touch, wild ideology driven from the backbench of a government that is completely out of touch and completely out of time. It's a lazy, tired and out-of-touch government led by a characterless marketing man who believes only in himself. And what is the product of it? It's another lazy, tired, dishonest, hateful and shallow assault on the retirement incomes of ordinary Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does it mean for ordinary families out there? What does it actually mean for them, their circumstances and their retirement incomes? Well, we know that the government has not got an answer on wages. Wage inequality will continue to grow. Real wages will continue to fall. We know they will continue to fall, because the best way of assessing future performance is past performance, and these jokers haven't got a plan. And what is the future for people's retirement incomes? Well, you can see it in this shambolic effort at legislating that we've seen over the last couple of months. Bits have fallen off this bill on its way into this place as if it were one of those broken-down old cars you used to see on <span style="font-style:italic;">Bush Mechanics</span>. At every bump in the road, bits and pieces fall off it. Why? Because there's nothing coherent about this plan except the hating on the industry super schemes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what does it mean for ordinary families? It means more risk. It means that you're more likely to be stapled to a low-performing fund. It means more risk and uncertainty, including investment uncertainty, for the superannuation funds and their investment vehicles that have done so well, particularly those of the industry funds, to mean that more Australians retire with dignity and with the prospect of a decent retirement for them and their families. What does it mean? It means more poverty. It means poverty from lower wages, from lower-performing funds getting a leg-up and from lower retirement incomes. And for many people, particularly workers in high-risk industries, it means the risk that they are underinsured or incorrectly insured or not insured at all. In industries like the building industry, where workers have benefited from the decision of the building unions and the building employers to offer insurance across those industries at low cost, many people will lose the benefit of an insurance scheme. That means that, when misfortune befalls them or their families, they will end up living in poverty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last time we saw this approach from the government was in the industrial relations omnibus bill, which became less and less omnibus as we got closer and closer to the vote. There have been some concessions. The approach that the government had coming into this—that somehow the Treasurer would have the capacity to override the investment decisions of superannuation funds—has, thankfully, fallen off the agenda. That is an idea that belonged in North Korea, not in Australia. That is an idea that should have been a relic of authoritarian governments in other countries, not this government. The idea that investment decisions that have been made in boardrooms and superannuation funds could be overruled by a politician is an absolute anathema to a functioning, decent market economy and an absolute threat to the security and the future of the superannuation industry. No other industry in Australia would tolerate that level of political interference. Whose idea was it? That idea is an orphan now, but it lived large amongst the coalition for so many months leading up to the last sitting week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The stapling mechanism will cause up to three million ordinary Australians to be stapled to underperforming funds, funds that don't do well, funds that drag retirement incomes backwards, where the cost of being in the fund and the returns on the fund mitigate against a decent retirement income for Australians. The impact on insurance—the failure to cover all of the APRA related entities that exist in superannuation. A third of the superannuation industry is explicitly excluded from what passes in the bill. There are flawed performance benchmarks. The administrative burden on funds will result in administrative costs being passed on to members through higher fees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the government side of this higher fees are the way that the retail funds and the big banks return big profits to shareholders and exorbitant executive salaries. But on this side of the House we stand for the industry fund model that's about low fees, that's about better performance, that's about higher retirement incomes for ordinary Australians. In truth, what this bill will do is increase the administrative burden on employers. Now, who knows what has been dealt in and what has been dealt out in this sordid legislative performance. One Nation certainly doesn't know. But 96 per cent of the time One Nation has signed up to the government's agenda, an agenda that they couldn't possibly understand. They won't be able to explain to Australians tomorrow what it is that they voted for. What is the advantage to ordinary Australians? To the ordinary working people in the regions and the suburbs of Queensland, who they purport to represent, they will not be able to explain tomorrow what on earth it is that they have done. Except we know that it has been done for their direct benefit, for their narrow political interests to suck up to, to cosy up to, the Morrison government. It is a poorly conceived, poorly drafted bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals can never be trusted on superannuation and retirement incomes. They have opposed it since the day that it was introduced. They have bitterly resented it. They resented it because it meant that people who they never thought should get a decent shake in life got a decent go, a decent retirement income and could retire with a little bit of dignity. They have never understood it and they certainly don't believe in it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is, I think, a deep loathing in the Liberal Party for industry superannuation and for the collective effort of workers. I was walking past a Liberal senator's office. It had this old poster of Robert Menzies on the front of the office and it said, 'Do you stand for Liberalism or socialism?' Bob Menzies was an old barrister who used to work for the AMWU, my old union, before he came into the parliament—represented us in the High Court on some very significant matters—and probably would never have taken the approach that passes for liberalism on the other side of this chamber on these kinds of issues. I tell you what, what is wrong with working Australians, through their unions, working together with their employers to build a system that's decent? What's wrong with them making a decision in a pluralist society, in a society where people can get together in their institutions and make a difference, to make a superannuation system that is the envy of the modern world? Well, the Liberal Party hates it and they are going to do everything they can to dismantle it. It's ordinary people who will suffer from their efforts.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:34</span>):  There are a number of points that I think everyone in this chamber would agree that we want included in superannuation laws. We want laws that test superannuation funds on their performance. We want laws that ensure superannuation funds are spending members' money wisely. We want laws that ensure fewer duplicate funds are created and that ensure superannuation fund members have access to accurate and timely information about the performance of their funds and are able to move to better performing funds with minimum restrictions. These objectives should be quite achievable. Unfortunately, we have before us today a poorly drafted bill that has struggled with these issues, and in many respects it's failed in these issues. If we all agree that those are sensible objectives, then our job today is to ensure that they are met.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is the party of superannuation. We introduced it. We have consistently defended it and consistently improved it. We've done so because it is a core Labor value, something that we treasure—and that is dignity in retirement. As a result, Australians have $3 trillion in nest eggs for retirement—$3 trillion of economic security to enjoy after decades and decades of hard work, $3 trillion of investment in the economy and $3 trillion of planning for the future. As the Morrison government has learnt, Labor will not stand by and let this extraordinary achievement be degraded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports the objectives of the Treasury Laws Amendment (More Flexible Superannuation) Bill. But, as I've said, superannuation is a Labor legacy and we want to see our superannuation system performing well. So we support the implementation of measures that will prevent members from unintentionally opening multiple superannuation accounts. We support the implementation of an objective performance benchmark for superannuation funds. We believe profoundly in the fundamental principle that superannuation trustees must always act in the best interests of their members, not those of parent entities, those of shareholders or those in the banking industry. As a result, Labor cannot support the bill in the form that it is being brought forward by the government today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The passage of this bill through this chamber as it is drafted would damage the interests of current and future Australian superannuation fund members, working Australians who deserve that dignity in their retirement, working Australians who deserve our respect. So we all have a job of work to do today and for as long as this debate continues. Labor cannot support the bill as drafted, so we will aim to fix it right here in the Senate. We believe that if we all hold on to those key concepts—dignity in retirement, respect for working Australians and proceeding in the best interests of superannuation—then we might, but we should, get there. But, if the government can't accept the simple fixes that we propose, then we will protect the interests of Australian workers by voting this poorly drafted bill down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will be moving a series of amendments to fix this bill. We're not here to sink the bill; we're here to fix it. We want an objective performance test and we want to close down issues with multiple accounts. And, to be very clear, we cannot support a bill that staples members to underperforming funds for years. Treasury has estimated that 21 out of 77 default MySuper funds covering three million Australians will fail the benchmark on day one. This means that, if this bill passes, up to three million people will be stapled to a dud fund for life. That is a patently ridiculous and undesirable outcome, and it attests to the repeated pattern we see with this tired government, making an announcement claiming they've done something momentous and claiming to have solved a problem, but it is in the detail that we find all the flaws and all sorts of consequences that they have failed to consider. You cannot claim that this bill makes an improvement in workers' superannuation, when it leaves behind millions of Australians—three million Australians in this case. It's all announcement, no delivery. Independent modelling has estimated that this measure alone could cost Australians tens of thousands of dollars in retirement savings. Treasury's own information spelled most of this out for the government, who have simply chosen to ignore it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many other problems with this bill. It attacks the basis of insurance in superannuation—the industrial default system—meaning that workers in high-risk industries will miss out on insurance tailored to their profession. We heard the examples of those professions when Senator Brown spoke earlier in this place. Non-industrially determined funds often include exclusions in their default insurance packages for high-risk occupations. Labor knows that our truck drivers, construction workers, police officers, firefighters and health workers deserve better. It really begs the question: why is essential workers insurance under attack once again?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has already begrudgingly accepted the necessity of valuable, industrially relevant insurance for workers in high-risk industry, through its acceptance of the dangerous occupation exception to the putting members' interests first package in 2019. We must bear in mind that some workers actually choose to stay in two funds: one for access to affordable insurance and one that's self-managed. Yet the government is proposing these stapling measures, so workers who are changing into high-risk careers and do not choose their fund will likely remain in their previous fund, which may well have insurance which is inappropriate for their heightened risk. This bill threatens to undermine the provision of putting members' interests first reforms which relate to those dangerous occupations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finding insurance as a worker in a high-risk industry is difficult, and it will be made more difficult if this bill passes unamended. Workers who are stapled to a fund—it may be the super fund for their first job in hospitality, fast food or retail—and do not join their workplace default fund as their work changes face higher premiums, may be underwritten or may be excluded entirely from insurance cover. The very least we can do as legislators is to ensure that our first responders, who are out there every day risking their lives for our safety, have the insurance cover that they need and the cover that they deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another huge problem is the rush the government is in. It just doesn't seem to be able to get its act together when it comes to the timing and implementation of its decisions. This is just like the massive Medicare changes announced by Minister Hunt in late May, giving the health sector just weeks instead of months to change over its entire system to support almost 1,000 changes. Now the government wants these superannuation changes to take effect from 1 July 2021—this year. That will mean that Australian employers have to scramble to implement new systems in just a couple of weeks. So you've got to ask: what is the rush? There's no answer to that question, except that once again we see a level of fumbling and incompetence, with rushed changes which have major implications. You could be forgiven for thinking that the Morrison government lives in la-la land, not contemporary Australia. Just like those Medicare changes, here is another example of magical thinking; the government has completely forgotten that the changes don't just magically happen with a vote in our parliament or by Ministers Hume and Hunt simply waving their magic wands. There is the practical process of implementing such significant change to be considered. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill introduces new administrative burdens on superannuation funds, tying funds up in red tape, which will ultimately be paid for by superannuation members through increased administration fees. The government's bill also has huge gaps in coverage as it will only cover default MySuper products when the majority of underperforming funds are concentrated in the choice sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For these many reasons, Labor cannot support the bill as drafted, and, as I said earlier, we will aim to fix that here in the Senate. I'll just add a couple of salient points. As most of us who are genuinely engaged in matters of ensuring that working Australians have sufficient retirement savings know, member engagement is critical to ensuring that super fund members are in the scheme that best suits their personal needs and career and life stages. Super funds have a range of products, including various investment choices. To staple a person to a fund with limited choices may not be in that person's long-term best interests. As you go through life, circumstances change; we know that. What suits an 18-year-old in casual work will not necessarily suit that person when they are maybe a 40-year-old professional. Stapling a super fund member to their first fund is contrary to member engagement, as it will encourage a 'set and forget' mentality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want super fund members to take an interest and to take responsibility, and much of that is about education. Rather than encouraging 'set and forget', the federal government should be encouraging Australians to take control of their super, including selecting the death, disability and income protection insurance that is most suitable to their individual circumstances, and their planning for a comfortable retirement. An important aspect of taking control is having comparative super fund information readily available. This must be on a consistent basis for retail and profit-to-member funds, which is not the case at present. There are some actual costs that retail funds are not required to declare at the moment. It would be an undesirable outcome if, as a result of this bill passing the Senate, millions of Australians are stapled to underperforming funds and untested superannuation products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its current form, the bill encourages that set-and-forget environment where working Australians don't take an interest in their super, don't bother checking their balances, never discover the miracle of compound interest and don't make choices that best suit their situation and the nature of their work. The situation is even more baffling because it espouses the opposite of the Liberal ideology of individual choice and self-determination. Is the Morrison government playing some form of game? Does it want people disinterested in and disengaged from their superannuation? Is this about another ideological foray by some kind of elitist view—a paternalistic group of Liberal people saying to working Australians, 'You're not competent to look after your own money, so we should do that for you'? I say to senators opposite: is getting your hands on the money what this is all about in the long term? We know that's been the plan for a very long time—to get your hands on members' money. I have my suspicions, and I sincerely hope that, in our deliberations on this bill, you prove those suspicions wrong, and let people take charge of their super without your involvement.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="252157" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WALSH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:50</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Your Future, Your Super) Bill 2021 and the related bills. Firstly, let me say how absolutely shameful this government is. This government has once again shown how pathetically desperate it is in attacking super. They're so desperate that they've resorted tonight to secretive deals to rush through their latest round of attacks. Labor will always support improvements to super, but Labor cannot support this bill as it has been put forward by the government today. We cannot support a bill that staples members to underperforming funds, we cannot support a bill that leaves high-risk workers without proper insurance, and we cannot support a bill that gives the government unilateral power to decide what's in the best financial interests of superannuation members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a proud record on superannuation. It's the vision and determination of successive Labor governments and unions that have delivered what is now a world-class universal superannuation system. Since then, attacks from the other side have continued in this place—day after day, year after year—because those people opposite, who sit on those benches, do not want Australians to retire with their own funds and to retire in dignity. Those opposite simply cannot be trusted when it comes to superannuation. Only Labor will fight for Australians' superannuation. We will always fight for a dignified retirement for all Australians and we will always fight the attacks on superannuation by those on the other side.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of this bill introduces a new system for stapling members to a single superannuation account. The first problem with these rushed bills tonight is that the government has set a deadline of 1 July 2021 for this schedule to begin. That's only two weeks away. This is a rushed job, and it's a rushed job that will see workers stapled to underperforming funds. Critically, this deadline must be extended. This deadline must be extended to ensure that performance testing of superannuation funds has begun before any stapling begins. If the stapling mechanism commences before performance testing is underway then, as we all know, individuals will be stapled to failing funds. If this bill comes into effect before this performance test is underway then underperforming funds will be able to keep accepting new members—new members who will also be stapled to these funds, potentially for life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Treasury has estimated that 21 out of 77 default MySuper funds would fail this test on day one, and those 21 funds cover over three million Australians. So if this bill is passed tonight, in this rushed job that the government has put forward tonight without proper amendments, then from 1 July those three million Australians could be stapled to an underperforming fund. That's three million Australians who could lose thousands of dollars in their retirement savings and whose futures would be worse off because of this government's latest attempts to undermine superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also attacks the basis of insurance in superannuation: the industrial default system. This Senate made really important changes to the 'putting members' interests first' bill to create the dangerous occupation exception. This allowed funds with tailor-made insurance cover for workers in hazardous occupations to continue providing default opt-out cover for their members, regardless of their age. That exception has preserved insurance cover for some of Australia's most at-risk workers. Around 2.7 million Australians work in the most high-risk occupations: building and construction workers, miners, agricultural workers, health workers, emergency services workers, truck drivers and delivery workers. These are essential workers—the same essential workers that this government has relied upon to help get us through a global pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And how does the government show its thanks to these essential workers? By making a dodgy deal to ram through this bill and make the Senate stay up all night to debate it. These workers deserve better. Whether these workers are up on scaffolding, down a mine or working on the front line of a pandemic, death and total and permanent disability insurance is their safety net. It protects workers and their families in the worst possible situations. Too many funds have exclusions in their default insurance packages for high-risk occupations. The stapling mechanism proposed by this government could see these workers stapled to funds that do not include default insurance that is appropriate to their high-risk professions. This government would leave those workers and their families without the safety net that they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Building and construction is the third-highest sector for fatalities in the workplace, and each year almost 35,000 workers join the construction workforce. Many start out as young apprentices. But, as of today, only seven funds nationwide offer default opt-out cover to under-25s. One of those funds is Cbus, Construction and Building Unions Superannuation. Cbus member Andrew was 23 years old when he was injured at work, crushed by two glass plates weighing in excess of 1.6 tonnes. Andrew sustained serious spinal and pelvic injuries. He was lucky to have even survived. Andrew was hospitalised for over a month, during which time he watched his wife give birth to their first child while he was in a wheelchair. Thankfully, Andrew and his family today are recovering well. His Cbus insurance made an enormous difference to his health and his quality of life. He says that he cannot imagine what could have happened if he and his family had been left without insurance cover. Had Andrew been stapled to any fund except one of the seven funds that use the dangerous occupation exception, he would not have had any cover. This government's bill would have meant that Andrew and his brand-new family would have been left without any support. This is shameful. What does this government have to say to people like Andrew? What does this government have to say to families like Andrew's, who could have faced incredible financial turmoil, hardship and stress right at the very time they needed support to get better and needed to celebrate the birth of their child?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Cbus member Shannon was in his early 20s, retirement was the last thing on his mind, but the insurance that he received as part of his superannuation is having a profound effect on his life. Shannon is 30 years old and lives in Albury, on the Victoria-New South Wales border, with his wife, Bianca, and their six-year-old daughter. Shannon previously worked in a brickworks, in a job that he loved. Three years ago, he fell backwards as a result of an anxiety attack and injured his spine. He is now in a wheelchair. Shannon says that, without the insurance that he received from his total and permanent disability claim as part of the insurance on his Cbus policy, he and his family would have lost everything. Even though he wasn't injured at work, his Cbus policy covered him, but insurance policies provided by many other superannuation funds would not have. If Shannon had been stapled to another fund, as this bill seeks to do to so many workers, his family would have lost everything.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what this government will do to Australia's most high-risk workers. They are risking the futures of Australian workers and families who face losing everything if they get injured and are left without proper insurance. But this government, as we know, has no regard for Australian workers, especially those in high-risk occupations—our construction workers, truck drivers, emergency services workers and health workers. They all deserve so much better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is not satisfied just with undermining the future savings and safety nets of Australian workers. They've decided that this bill needs to go further. They've decided to try to give themselves unilateral powers to decide what superannuation funds can spend their money on. They've given themselves the extraordinary power to determine what is or isn't in the best financial interests of members. The government are not interested in protecting the best financial interests of superannuation members, because when it comes to superannuation they have never acted in the best financial interests of Australian workers. The only financial interest the government know how to protect is that of themselves and their mates. We have seen similar powers used in the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility to block investment in renewable energy jobs in North Queensland. Whose best financial interests was the government protecting then? Whose best financial interests were this government trying to protect when they used their powers to block investments in creating jobs? The only financial interests the government know how to protect are their own. Questions remain about the way this bill allows the Treasury to reach into the democratically elected boardrooms of superannuation funds to block investments that he might disagree with. Questions remain about the way in which the application of the best financial interests test in this bill as it currently stands could actually undermine members' interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Superannuation is a Labor legacy, and Labor will always protect superannuation. Labor will always support the future of Australians. That's why Labor will move amendments to this bill that provide simple fixes to the serious concerns that we have—fixes that should be supported in this chamber. Labor will always be here to protect and improve superannuation, but we won't support the bill if these issues are not fixed and our serious concerns are not addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this government, wages have been stagnant for a long time. Under this government, super has been frozen for a long time. Under this government, Australians have faced attack after attack on their super. This time, what they face is a future where they are stapled to underperforming funds that provide them and their family with no insurance, no protection and no safety net against the worst-case scenario. So there are two things that Australians can always be sure of. The first is that the Liberal and National parties will always find new ways to undermine superannuation, and the second is that Labor will always be here to stop them.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:02</span>):  I rise tonight to talk about the Treasury Laws Amendment (Your Future, Your Super) Bill 2021 and associated bills. I want to make a contribution on these bills; particularly on the impact on young people of superannuation and how these changes may or may not benefit them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that young people are becoming more disengaged and disinterested in politics. I'd like to think that that is not true, and when I started here I thought there was a way to turn that around. But what we have seen tonight is exactly why young people are disengaged and disinterested in politics. It's stunts and stuff like this—hours motions given to the Senate chamber mere moments before they're due to be debated and considered; hours motions that truncate three separate bills into one debating format so that that debate happens in the middle of the night, when most people are not watching what is discussed. The gallery has gone home. The government wants to push these reforms through in the middle of the night. That really is the worst type of politics, because if you believe in your reforms, if you believe that they stack up and if you believe that your legislation should go through all of the phases of scrutiny in this chamber, then you wouldn't be pushing these bills through tonight in this format.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Super is vitally important to every Australian. It's vitally important to young Australians. It's vitally important to workers across the country. That's why Labor built superannuation and why we are fighting to protect it. It's why we defend superannuation against this government time and time again. The government can accuse Labor of reading too much into provisions of this bill or drawing a long bow, but the fact is that members opposite have been really open and frank about their views on superannuation. They've said that superannuation should be voluntary. They've opposed increases to superannuation contributions. If given their chance, they would destroy superannuation in the form that Labor built it. That's why it is incredibly important for the proper scrutiny to occur when legislation is passed in this place. The government is not allowing that to happen in this Senate, and it should be ashamed of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is fundamentally flawed. We know many members on this side of the chamber have pointed that out tonight. There's certainly reform required, but we need to get that reform right and we shouldn't be pushing through reform for the sake of a media release, for the sake of a win for the government; we should be pushing forward reform that improves the lives of Australian workers. What we know is that submission after submission to the Senate inquiry on this bill recommended changes to the legislation to fix the problems, to make it work for working people. Many of the submissions that are available online and the Labor senators' dissenting report identify a number of critical flaws in the bill that haven't been rectified by this government. So Labor is pursuing amendments in this chamber to fix the flaws in this bill. If I were a member opposite, I would be more alarmed about some of the proposed changes, their impact on superannuation, what these changes will do and what they say about this government and their idea of transparency and accountability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the bill provides an extraordinary power that would allow the Treasurer to personally override any investment decision or payment decision made by a superannuation trustee. Why would the Treasurer need such an extraordinary power? Why would the Treasurer need an extraordinary power of that kind? What sort of investments would the Treasurer use that power for? We can only look to current examples of where ministers have used their powers to stop investment decisions occurring. The people living in Far North Queensland are acutely aware that Minister Pitt used his powers to veto a NAIF loan to a wind farm because, he said, it was in opposition to the government's policy. It was in opposition to the government's energy policy to build a wind farm. For goodness's sake, 250 jobs is in opposition to this government's energy policy? I've never heard such a thing. But the government stepped in and used its power. So of course alarm bells are ringing about how the Treasurer may use the extraordinary power that this bill is providing him tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that there are concerns about implementation of stapling mechanisms which would cause up to three million Australians to be stapled to underperforming funds. We also know that there are concerns about the impact on the insurance cover that Australian workers would have. It means that Australian workers in certain industries could be left without adequate insurance coverage as a result of the bill. It might not seem like such a big deal to those opposite, but they work in this building. They work in their offices and the CPOs probably. They don't work in high-risk industries. In high-risk industries you need insurance that is specific to your industry, because there's industry knowledge that goes along with that insurance product. And it's not just the product itself. It's the people who go out and talk to injured workers. It's the people who talk to the families and walk people through making claims and getting back on their feet. That's what these insurance products do. There's a concern that this could come to an end under this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also explicitly excludes up to one-third of all superannuation funds regulated by APRA from performance measurements. When the government says that this bill is about your future, your super, well, it's not really about all super, is it? It's just about certain kinds of super. If one-third of super has been excluded it is not really about your super, your future. It's about certain types of superannuation. The government likes to use names of bills to be quite clever and cloak what they're actually trying to do. Remember when they called the ensuring integrity bill 'ensuring integrity' and not the union-killing bill. Remember the Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia's Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2020, even though what that bill actually did was reduce the working conditions of casual workers in the mining industry. This government needs to learn that just because you say something in the name of a bill it doesn't mean you're fooling workers. Just because you come in here and say the word 'worker' a lot doesn't mean that you're actually helping them, and it doesn't mean that they will believe you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that a number of stakeholders have identified flaws in the performance benchmarks originally proposed by the government, including the exclusion of administration fees and potential discouragement of investment in Australian assets. We want to deter that, don't we! Investment in Australian assets. I mean, why would the government be deterring investment in Australian assets? It's because they haven't thought through these changes or these reforms and they haven't taken on board the very considered submissions and concerns raised by stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we also know that the proposed start date of this bill is in a couple of weeks time. It could have significant impacts on employers who will be required to implement changes to payroll processes in a very short time frame, but the government doesn't seem very concerned about that. They are concerned about pushing this bill through and getting a deal done with Senator Hanson and One Nation. We know that Senator Hanson has circulated some amendments. I have to say that tax law is not my area of expertise, but when you have a look at some of these amendments it might be difficult to understand what the point of these amendments really are. Essentially, the government has done a deal to improve the tax concessions of Senator Hanson herself. The amendments will essentially reduce the tax liability of individuals who are taxed under division 293. Now, I didn't know what division 293 was. I didn't know who gets taxed under division 293, but I had a look, and do you know who gets taxed under division 293?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at who division 293 applies to, it's a tax on those paying additional super contributions. That reduces the tax concession for individuals whose combined income equals $250,000. That's what those amendments are about. They're not about helping battlers, as my colleague Senator Watt pointed out and they're not about helping the pensioners who live in Far North Queensland, or Rockhampton or all the way through to the Sunshine Coast. These are the people who Senator Hanson visits, telling them that she will have their backs. These amendments are not about them, these amendments are about giving a tax concession to people who earn $250,000 or above.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I started my contribution tonight by talking about young people. When we compare that amendment, which I assume they will support tomorrow, and what the government is pushing through with these three bills—because that's how the government has got the deal to get these through—with what young people have been through in the last year, it's absolutely disgraceful. When young people needed this government, this government turned its back on them. This government refused to give JobKeeper to casuals and it refused to give JobKeeper to people who were working in casual work. Where were most young people working? In casual employment. So those people had nowhere to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What did the government say? 'You can dip into your own super; you can support yourself! Everyone else at this end of the bracket is doing fine but when it comes to supporting you, you need to dip into your own super.' What we now know, after the early-access scheme was delivered by this government, is that of course young people who accessed the scheme spent that money paying off their mortgages or rent. They didn't have work so they used the money to pay household bills—because they couldn't get JobKeeper. But they will be worse off in their superannuation retirement savings because they used the early-access scheme. Yes, they managed not to be evicted. That's great, but the government didn't do anything else to help them. They had to help themselves. We know that if an individual withdrew the average figure from early access at their first opportunity then they have already forgone $2,420 in returns from market growth—already. Forget about what happens when they're 60. An individual who withdrew the maximum amount of $20,000 has already forgone $3,000 of additional savings. That's already, because the super market has bounced back so quickly after COVID.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When young people needed this government, what did they do? They turned their backs on them and they're pushing through superannuation laws which do nothing to help restore their super balances. And they're doing it through an hours motion which means that this Senate chamber is not able to debate and discuss this legislation in the way that it should. It's no wonder that young people are turning their backs on politics when this government is behaving in this sort of way. It's no wonder that young people know that this government will never, ever be there to help them; they will only be there to help themselves.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:20</span>):  I rise, like so many of my colleagues here today, to speak against the Treasury Laws Amendment (Your Future, Your Super) Bill 2021, but I do note that this piece of legislation is actually being debated in the cognate form, so there are a couple of other bits attached to it just so that they can really go beyond the pale in their attack on the retirement of Australians. This bill, as it stands before the Senate right now, is a concerted attempt at ensuring that the for-profit superannuation funds have systemic advantage over better-performing all-profit-to-members industry super funds and completely counteracts the recommendations of the banking royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is as Senator Green indicated when she spent some time during her contribution explaining the mechanics of the way in which the government is orchestrating this attack on superannuation by the way they're managing the chamber. I want anybody who might happen to be watching at this time of night, or those who are listening, to imagine right now that I'm holding one hand above the other in a sign that has become commonly known to Australians through advertising that indicates the sign of a super fund that has members' interests at its heart and that returns the benefits to those members in their retirement. That is very, very different from so many of the retail funds who are raking in profits at the expense of ordinary hardworking Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is it with this Morrison government? It's attack after attack, revealing ideological attempts to sabotage Australia's superannuation system. They continually, and I do mean continually, fail to understand the real value of one of Australia's greatest public policy achievements. Instead, they seek to undermine it at every turn. I hear the groans from the other side, because they did not understand the concept of universal superannuation for all Australians when Labor established it. They said it couldn't work and that it would destroy the economy. They decried its death before it was even born. The reality is that it took Labor's vision to establish it. It has taken Labor vision to continue to grow it, and at every turn this government has resisted it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see with this government is a mob who attacked Labor relentlessly at the last election with their lies about a retiree tax. Yet they've spent their entire term in government attacking the security, attacking the profitability and attacking the very retirement savings schemes that benefit retirees. They've not let up on their constant attacks on your superannuation. That's about the only bit of the title of the bill that's right. It's 'your' superannuation because Labor helped build this. It established the foundations. It looked after it. It nurtured it. It grew it. It supported it. It's your super; it's yours because Labor made it so. But it's this government's attacks on it that will make it their super. That's what they're after. Unless you are a former member of the government or a big banker, beware: this government is not on your side.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those sitting opposite me, the Liberal-National party, are too tone deaf to read the room, despite the global pandemic, economic meltdown, growing job insecurity and threats to small business and sole traders that have been overwhelming. This government isn't fixated on sorting out those issues. No, they've decided they will fixate on dismantling, damaging, breaking, eroding and constantly attacking our world-class superannuation scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, as has been indicated by many of my colleagues, will be advancing amendments. There are a number of amendments that are being proposed and circulated around the chamber. Let's be clear: the bill as it stands—and we are forced to give our second reading responses right now—is a disaster for so many Australians who deserve so much better from this government. The Morrison government, it appears, has done another little secret deal with One Nation to ram through its controversial super bill. And now here we are. The Senate is forced to sit at these uncivilised hours, without adequate time and proper due process to provide the careful consideration necessary to make something decent of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is in fact important legislation because it affects every Australian. It's also complex legislation. If it is passed as it sits here right now, there will be seismic changes to Australians' retirement security. Working families, decent hardworking Australians starting up their small businesses or operating as sole traders, people working for others and giving the benefit of their labour to businesses and this country and their families—they are counting on us here, under the cover of darkness, after a sneaky little move by the government, under the most adverse circumstances, to try and fix the government's Treasury Laws Amendment (Your Future, Your Super) Bill. We don't know exactly what dodgy deal was made to trap us all here tonight, to have this little game around this piece of legislation instead of following full and due process, but we do know what is at stake if this legislation is passed as it stands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its current form, this legislation will deliver a situation where millions of Australians will be missing out on a more comfortable retirement. That has got to be a bad thing. As it stands, this legislation will lock workers into dud funds. That is a bad outcome. The legislation as it stands will axe life insurance for hundreds of thousands of Australians who work in dangerous occupations. Those workers went to bed perhaps an hour ago, ready to get up and do their day's work tomorrow, and they will find it hard to believe that their own government would actually construct legislation to take away insurance protections from them and their family. This government has constructed a piece of legislation, which we are looking at right now in this chamber, that excludes the worst funds from scrutiny. It's hard to believe that they would do that, but that's exactly what they've done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill as it stands would allow the Treasurer, Mr Frydenberg, and future treasurers to actually take over super investments. That is government interference of a scale that I find completely inexplicable. It's beyond me how anyone who calls themselves a liberal—and I do mean that in the general sense of the word: enlightened, somebody who is about choice and opportunity and the freedom of the individual—could vote for a bill or bring into this chamber a bill which contains a provision that enables the Australian Treasurer to take control of Australian people's savings and gives that Treasurer the power to direct the way their savings are invested. Can you believe that this is what this government is attempting to do to its own citizens?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is proposed by those opposite is beyond a joke. If a Labor government ever had the gall to attempt to introduce something and ram through legislation like this, those people opposite would be calling us communists. Josh Frydenberg, when is your next five-year plan for our superannuation industry? The party that famously tried to ban the Communist Party now wants to seek powers for itself to directly intervene and manage the private investment funds of Australians from the office of none other than the Treasurer of the country. That's how arrogant this government is: Mr Frydenberg, the only man who can manage your money! I tell you what, he's going to be found wanting if this gets through because he cannot do what the great trustees of our superannuation funds have done—particularly those from industry super.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's being attempted here by this government is entirely uncalled for. It is extreme and it sets a dangerous precedent in Australian society and law. If this bill, as it stands, were to pass then hardworking Australians will be stapled to underperforming funds. The Productivity Commission found that a worker will be $660,000 worse off than an identical worker in a high-performing industry fund. That's the gap. If this were to happen it would render industrial default selection in enterprise agreements inoperable and leave workers far more vulnerable when they move to high-risk industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's exactly what happened to a young man by the name of Andrew. He was 23 years old and out doing a good day's work. He was injured, suffering serious spinal and pelvic injuries in that accident. Being a member of an industry super fund, the Cbus fund, he was provided with insurance cover. There's every likelihood that Andrew, and others like him, will be stapled to funds that cannot provide the protection they need when they move into any construction industry, essentially. We know that this government is constructing a danger zone for families and workers, where they are insurance free. It's hard to think where those families will be if this government gets its way tonight. This bill will make it so much harder for construction workers, transport workers, nurses, police officers and paramedics, who do such remarkable work for our community. This government will make it harder for those very people to find appropriate levels of insurance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look to One Nation and say to them: are these really the workers who you want to leave worse off? Really? Are these the people who you're willing to sacrifice in some sort of deal with the government? They need to remember this tonight—that One Nation stood between Australians and adequate insurance for their families by supporting this piece of legislation and by facilitating its hasty, unseasonal, untimely and inappropriate progress through this parliament. This bill is flawed and it's because this government really has no real understanding of who the hardworking Australians are. It doesn't know—it doesn't have members on its benches who understand what it's like to work two or three jobs to feed your family. They don't understand the challenges of how much the cost of living has risen in the last eight years that they've been in government, under three different prime ministers. Wages are not growing under this government, families are under increasing pressure and now their super won't grow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 in this bill would oblige the regulator to conduct an annual performance benchmarking of the industry super funds—the MySuper products. However, whilst the bill outlines the consequences for failing the benchmarks, the yet-to-be-determined regulations do not set out what those benchmarks are. 'Just trust us,' they say. Well, I'm completely over trusting this government! This overreliance on regulation issued by the minister increases the uncertainty for members, for funds and for investment. It's the role of this chamber to scrutinise legislation, not to allow the Treasurer to determine what the benchmarks should be at some point in time. That's the worst kind of action this chamber could allow—to give that power to the government in an unobserved way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No worker should be stuck in underperforming super products. Products that persistently underperform should be removed from the system. This bill should be stricter, with mandated assessments of administration fees and benchmarks. And the period which they should cover should be longer to better reflect the cycle that's necessary for good investment. The schedule should definitely not pass in its current form. The best financial interest duty will require industry super funds to consider the best interests of members, but the best financial interest duties will not apply to bank-owned profit funds due to their structure. It's not appropriate to have this differentiation. Why does this government constantly attack the superannuation system? Because it never believed in it and it's going to continue to attempt to dismantle things, and that will break the lives of good Australian people. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:35</span>):  It's great to be here tonight to talk about this legislation. I'm not going to lie to you: it's still ultimately lipstick on a pig. There isn't a plastic surgeon in the world that can bring this dead, stinking carcass called superannuation and make it look attractive—I can assure you of that. I will tell you why: it's because superannuation is a lie.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at the statistics that come out every month, these are the latest. The median balance for women aged 55 to 64 is $118,000. That's the median balance after 28 years. For men it's $183,000. Most of these 55- to 64-year-olds would have had 30 years of superannuation, albeit the early years were at a lower rate, but that's still less than half to get to the cut-off for the full pension. Long story short: 50 per cent of the people in this country are still never going to come off the pension. We drop $40 billion a year in lost tax revenue that goes to the wealthy—it's only the top 10 to 20 per cent of the people who get these taxation concessions. They don't need the incentives. They're already wealthy as it is. For 13 million workers in the country, that's 3,000 bucks a pop to basically subsidise the wealthy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that you've got another $40 billion in fees shuffling around with all these different rules, stapling and benchmarking—paperwork doing this and paperwork doing that. We've become a nation of paper shufflers. Instead of focusing on asset creation, we've now got everyone trading assets and liabilities instead of actually producing goods and services. That's all gone offshore. We've just driven up the price of assets through superannuation. There's that much money in super now—$3 trillion in super. That's more than what the stock market is worth, so $600 billion of it has had to go offshore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To make these things look better than they really are, there's a bit of a deal going around with all of the investment funds in the world that, if you invest in another country, you don't have to pay tax. We've a classic one here: section 855 in the 1997 act basically says that if you're a foreigner and you invest in non-real assets, and you own less than 10 per cent, you don't have to pay capital gains tax on it. That's to appease them. We have foreign funds investing here and our funds invest offshore. They all give each other tax breaks, and basically there's base erosion and profit shifting, where all the wealthy fund managers make all the money and pay themselves bonuses because they don't have to pay tax. The workers are the ones who have to pay for it—this is the sad reality. The number of people who are still on the full pension has not moved since 1992, and the number of people on the part pension has reduced from about 28 per cent to 22 per cent, but about four per cent of that is from when they changed the pension thresholds back in 2017. All of this paper shuffling and all of these tax concessions achieve nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now we could be in here talking about an infrastructure bank, doing something around finance and fixing up monetary policy in this country, but, no, we're talking about the superannuation that only looks after the rivers of gold for both the union funds and the banks. I want to be clear about this: I'm agnostic; I was never in favour of superannuation from the get go. I can remember when the August 1991 budget first came in, because it was my first year of working. I can remember thinking, 'Why is someone going to take three per cent of my income and give it to someone I've never met to manage it?' I had just finished a Bachelor of Commerce the year before and had a HECS debt, where I got brainwashed—I had to pay to be brainwashed, because I was taught about efficient market hypothesis and things like that, but that's a story for another day—and then suddenly I was told that I wouldn't get to manage my own savings and that they were going to give it to someone I'd never met. And—guess what?—there was no guarantee I was ever going to get it back. That's what I love about the finance industry. If I took my car to a mechanic and it came back with two wheels on it, I'd probably have a pretty good case to go to the Ombudsman and say, 'Listen, I think I've been gypped.' But with fund managers there's no guarantee you're ever going to get your capital back. They get a guaranteed fee, and if they do well they'll pay themselves a bonus. But if they lose the money it suddenly becomes a relative thing: 'We only lost 15 per cent, and the market went down 20 per cent.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why don't you let people just put it in their house, subject to capital gains tax on housing above $2 million, at least for the people who don't have an active interest in their superannuation—and there are a lot of those people. That's one of the complaints over here about stapling. I tell you what they do care about: owning their own house. They get that much. What most people—the common man and the battler—do understand is real assets. They don't live in the land of the blowhards. There are two types of people in this country: the battlers and the blowhards. Labor sit here and complain about the battlers being shafted, but if they're serious about that they should let the battlers keep their own money. For most people, it's not 10 per cent of their income; it could be 100 per cent of their disposable income, if not more. Someone on $50,000 has to pay about $6,000 or $7,000 in tax, so their cost of living is $40,000. Why are we ripping out $4,000 a year in super to give it to someone these guys don't really care about when they need it now? They need it now just to make ends meet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no such thing as universal superannuation. The universal retirement scheme in this country is called the pension. It's been around for a lot longer than superannuation and it works fine. Get rid of the $40 billion in tax concessions. You could take half of that and give it back to the workers so they'd pick up an extra $2,000 a year, and put the other $20 billion into increasing the pension by 20 or 30 per cent. The pension for the bottom 72 per cent of people costs $52 billion. We give $40 billion in tax concessions to the top 10 or 20 per cent of people and we give $52 billion to the bottom 72 per cent of the people, but they're the ones who need it most. If you want a universal pension that's going to look after stay-at-home mothers, the unemployed, people with disabilities and women, why don't you do that? The logic: it's 10 per cent of your income, so if you're on a low income you only pay a small amount into super, so the benefits of super are much smaller. It is a completely inequitable scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go on about this directions power. I was quoted in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fin Review</span> as saying I don't support the directions power because that would be hypocritical. The reason it would be hypocritical for me to support it is that I believe in choice, personal responsibility and the importance for people to learn how to save their own money. There's this idea that people will never get the chance to invest if superannuation isn't an option. I tell you what: I was saving and had my nose to the grindstone a long time before superannuation was invented. It is completely hypocritical for Labor to come in here and get all upset because, 'How dare the government tell superannuation funds what to do!' I don't necessarily disagree with that, but how dare the government take 10 per cent of people's income, without ever asking them, and force them to give it to someone they've never met.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why can't we do what New Zealand did? New Zealand had a referendum on whether superannuation should be compulsory. You know what they voted? They voted against it 92 per cent to eight per cent. As for Senator O'Neill saying we're not the true liberals, I'm a true liberal because I think people should have the choice as to whether they want to invest in superannuation. It's their money. It's not the rivers of gold. It doesn't belong to the union funds or the banks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I did a masters of finance. There was one subject on superannuation, and I failed the assignment—luckily I still passed the exam—because I slagged off superannuation. I called out the banks in the 1990s because effectively they lost their deposit base, so CBA had to go and buy Colonial Mutual, NAB had to buy National Mutual, Westpac went and bought Bankers Trust and ANZ did a joint venture with ING. They were clipping the ticket with their rivers of gold. They'd have $500,000 in a mortgage over here and they'd clip the ticket on that, and then they'd have the deposit base over here through super and they'd clip the ticket on that, and they'd have financial planners and all this sort of stuff. Just before CBA got done over with the banking royal commission, their rate of return on their fund investment division was 66 per cent. That's an incredible return on equity. It just goes to show what a racket superannuation is. It's nothing but rivers of gold for the blowhards: banks, unions and whatever—I don't care. But it's time that we cracked down on this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As for somehow claiming that we're not supporting investment in Australian assets: there's already $600 billion invested offshore with superannuation. I've got the clip where Bob Hawke said that superannuation was going to be used to invest in Australian manufacturing. Well, that never happened, did it? Nor would it, because of the Button plan and the Dawkins plan. The Button plan destroyed manufacturing and the Dawkins plan destroyed higher education, turning our kids into commodities. Everything in this country now has been turned into a commodity. There's nothing about personal responsibility and letting the individual control things. No: we have to monetarise everything and it's our kids who have suffered the most, whether through child care or universities. They're just treated like a transaction and it's completely wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's a third side to superannuation which never gets discussed. It's the biggest black hole in this country: the $335 billion contingent liability for the non-military defined-benefit scheme for Canberra public servants. That's for 160,000 retired public servants and it works out at $2 million a pop. The liability for the top 40,000 of those people is $137 billion, which works out at $3½ million per retiree. If you're on more than $75,000 in retirement, based as an indexation of your final salary, then you must have been on a big final salary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can somebody tell me why public servants in this country aren't asset-tested or means-tested on their assets and income like people are in the private sector? If we want to talk about equality, I often get blowback about it and I'm told, 'We can't do anything about it because we can't go around breaking contracts.' There never was a contract. In order to have a contract you have to have an offer, an acceptance and terms and conditions. There was never an offer from the politicians in this country, on behalf of retired public servants, that they were going to pay themselves a gold-plated pension scheme. And there was certainly never an acceptance by the people or terms and conditions laid out as to just how expensive it was going to be. It's $345 billion, plus the military one, which is about $160 billion—I don't want to touch that, because these guys potentially put their lives on the line and their families get moved around a lot; we can match that off with the Future Fund. But that needs to be means-tested.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll mention this to Senator Hume. She brought in the 450 thing to make sure that everyone gets an equal break. But if you think that low-income earners were getting screwed because they weren't getting $45 extra a month in superannuation, I can tell you that we're all being screwed. That $345 billion for 25 million people works out at about 15,000 bucks a pop, which each and every one of us are paying, for the defined-benefits scheme superannuation. I say that we need to bring this lot into it as well, because the bureaucrats are milking us dry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll finish on a couple of other comments that were made by people on the other side. It was interesting that Senator Green would come in here if she didn't know anything about 293. If you know anything about super, you know that section 293 came in as an afterthought. That was because, effectively, wealthy people who would normally pay 45c in the dollar only paid 15c when they contributed into superannuation. So they saved 30c upfront. Then, once their money was in there, they only paid 15c on that. But it gets even better: if you make a capital gain, you get a one-third discount and you only pay 10 per cent on your capital gain. So if you have assets and things in there you get a whopping big deduction. I recommend that Senator Green go away and do a little bit of study about the tax concessions for superannuation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another point to note here is that Labor always says—and Senator Watt did this afternoon—that superannuation is going to guarantee a decent retirement. It's not going to guarantee a decent retirement for low-income earners. The only thing that can do that is a universal pension that doesn't discriminate on the income that you've earned throughout your life. This pension is paid to you and only means-tested on your income once you retire.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want to talk about equality in this country, why should someone who busted their guts—whether they were a cleaner or all those sorts of people; the higher up the ladder you go the easier it gets. I'm telling you now that it's the people on low incomes who work the hardest in this country. They probably drive further to work every day to get there and back again, and if they get a flat tyre and have to pay 400 bucks for a tyre that will hurt their budget a lot. But if we want to be serious about protecting the battlers in this country, it's time to kill superannuation stone, cold dead.</span>

                    <a href="266499" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUME</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Superannuation, Financial Services and the Digital Economy and Minister for Women's Economic Security</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:52</span>):  I would like to thank those senators who have contributed to the debate on these bills. With respect to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Your Future, Your Super) Bill 2021, I note that schedule 1 of this bill will prevent the creation of unintended multiple accounts, leading to higher retirement balances for Australians. The Productivity Commission found that structural flaws in the system, which lead to people paying unnecessary fees for holding multiple accounts they do not need, have resulted in lower retirement balances for millions of people. Schedule 1 will introduce a mechanism to prevent the creation of unintended multiple superannuation accounts when employees start a new job. If an employee does not choose a superannuation product when they start a new job then their employer will pay superannuation contributions into an existing account, where possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Default MySuper products are available to any member of the public. These products are required to provide death and total and permanent disability insurance cover on an opt-out basis. Notwithstanding this, the government understands that a small minority of funds maintain occupational exclusions for MySuper products. These exclusions may impact the appropriateness of cover that an individual ultimately receives, including as they change occupations over time. That's why the government has tasked Treasury with undertaking a review of occupational exclusions in default insurance offered by MySuper products, with a view to determining whether such exclusions remain appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of this bill will require APRA to conduct an annual objective performance test for MySuper products and other products, to be specified in regulations, holding superannuation funds to account for underperformance. All trustees of products that fail the test will be required to notify members in writing, making sure that they're aware when their superannuation product is underperforming. Where a product has failed the performance test in two consecutive years, the trustee will be prohibited from accepting new members into that product. APRA may lift the prohibition if circumstances specified in the regulations are satisfied. This stronger consequence will protect Australian workers from entering persistently-underperforming funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Superannuation trustees will also need to take into account the results of the performance tests when completing the annual outcomes assessment under the member outcomes legislation introduced by this government. The trustee of a persistently underperforming product will find it very difficult to show that their product is promoting the financial interests of members. Schedule 2 of the bill will also provide APRA with a resolution planning prudential-standard-making power to facilitate a more orderly exit of underperforming funds from the superannuation system. This change extends a power APRA already holds in the banking, general insurance and life insurance industries and will help protect members in underperforming funds. Extending this power to superannuation funds will provide new and further protections to members' retirement savings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These powers complement APRA's already-strong powers to regulate the superannuation industry where a trustee fails to meet their obligations under superannuation law. These include an ability to issue a direction to a trustee to consider a merger, where appropriate. APRA can also cancel or impose conditions on a trustee's licence to operate a superannuation fund and can revoke a fund's MySuper authorisation. APRA made it clear that it will act decisively where it has concerns about funds that have failed the performance test. APRA will take an escalated supervisory approach within its powers, including a requirement for formal remediation. When necessary, APRA has a broad range of powers to ensure resolution in the best interests of members and encourage orderly responses to underperformance, where appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the government announced the Your Future, Your Super policy in October 2020, we set out on a path for the extension from MySuper products in the first instance to include trustee directed products from 1 July 2022 and an intent to expand to other investment options over time. Treasury estimates that the performance test will cover 90 per cent of APRA-regulated accumulation assets from 1 July 2022. Delivering on the intent to further extend the reach of the underperformance test, the government has tasked Treasury with undertaking a consultation process by 1 July 2022 to consider how best to expand the annual performance test to other superannuation products, including non-trustee directed products and retirement phase products. This will ensure that the performance test continues to have appropriate coverage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 will also enable the regulations to specify metrics for ranking MySuper products and require these rankings to be published on the government's new interactive YourSuper comparison tool. The new comparison tool will provide simple, clear and trusted information to empower members to make their own decisions about who manages their retirement savings. Schedule 3 of the bill will prevent retirement incomes from being unnecessarily eroded and will restore trust in Australia's mandatory superannuation system. It does this by amending the existing best-interest duty in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, the SI(S) Act, to specify that this duty requires the trustee to act in the best financial interests of the member. Schedule 3 of the bill implements recommendation 22 of the Productivity Commission's superannuation inquiry, which recommended that the government clarify what it means for a trustee to act in members' best interests under the SI(S) Act. In order to ensure that these new requirements operate as intended, the government will conduct a review of the changes to the evidential burden of proof and the changes to the record-keeping obligations. This review will be conducted as soon as practicable three years after the commencement of these provisions.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These landmark reforms will ensure that the superannuation system works harder for all Australians by reducing waste, holding underperforming funds to account and strengthening protections around the retirement savings of millions of Australians. With respect to the Treasury Laws Amendment (More Flexible Superannuation) Bill 2020 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (Self Managed Superannuation Funds) Bill 2020, I would like to thank those senators who contributed to this debate, and I commend these bills to the Senate.</span>
