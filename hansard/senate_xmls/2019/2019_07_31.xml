                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:31</span>):  I rise again to continue my contribution on the Health Insurance Amendment (Bonded Medical Programs Reform) Bill 2019, which will amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 by introducing a statutory scheme to administer the reformed bonded medical programs from 1 January 2020. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are currently 9,406 program participants studying at medical schools or in prevocational training under the older programs—the Bonded Medical Places Scheme and the Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship Scheme—with a further 623 participants undertaking their return-of-service obligations. These participants will have the option to opt in to the new arrangements from 1 January 2020, and those who choose to stay under the existing arrangements will also be able to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the program matures, up to 700 doctors are expected to commence their return-of-service obligations in rural, remote and regional Australia each year over the next five to seven years. To be eligible to participate in the reformed bonded medical programs, a person must have accepted a bonded Commonwealth-funded place in a course of study in medicine at an Australian university. They must be an Australian citizen or permanent visa holder and agree to participate in the program using a web portal maintained by the department.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the new statutory scheme, participants will be required to work as a medical practitioner in eligible locations for a total period of three years. The three-year return-of-service obligation is half of the six years required under the previous Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship Scheme and a reduction of between one and three years for previous bonded medical programs scheme participants who entered the scheme in 2015 or earlier. Participants in the bonded medical programs scheme who entered the scheme in the years 2016 to 2019 agreed to a 12-month return-of-service obligation. These participants will retain their 12-month return-of-service obligation under the new statutory scheme should they voluntarily opt in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the new scheme, the return-of-service obligations must be completed within 18 years from when the participant completes their course of study in medicine at an Australian university, but they may be completed by a series of periods. The period of 18 years to complete the return-of-service obligation may be extended in limited circumstances only where a participant or a family member has a medical condition that prevents that participant from completing their return-of-service obligation within the time frame. A participant will be subject to a number of conditions, including that they must complete their course of study in medicine at an Australian university. The return-of-service obligation must be completed in accordance with the rules, and the participant must give their information or documents to the department in particular circumstances. These are necessary safeguards to protect our investments in these participants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Should a participant withdraw from their course of study in medicine after the census date for the second year of study, that participant will be liable to pay the Commonwealth the cost of the participant's course of study for the year or part year—semester—of study undertaken, plus interest. Where a participant does not complete their return-of-service within 18 years from completion of their course of study or an extended period, that person will be liable to pay the Commonwealth the cost of the person's course of study that was funded by the Commonwealth, less a pro rata proportion of the return-of-service completed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the new statutory scheme, medical benefits will not be payable to an MRBS participant who becomes a participant under the new statutory scheme and does not complete their return-of-service within 18 years. Medical benefits will not be payable for six years from the day that breach occurs. Further, under the new statutory scheme a participant may be liable for an administrative penalty of $10,000 if the person fails to comply with the condition to provide the department with information or documents. This administrative penalty is considered to be a debt due to the Commonwealth and may be recovered, if needed, by the Commonwealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A participant will be able to withdraw from the bonded medical programs at any time by notifying the department using the web portal maintained by the department.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, these are necessary safeguards to protect our investment into these doctors, and they will protect the integrity of the scheme. However, the changes being made to the bonded medical programs are welcome. They will encourage young people interested in a career in medicine to work in more remote, rural and regional areas of our beautiful country. It will expose them to a different kind of medical practice and give them valuable experience for wherever their career may take them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Doctors in rural and regional areas often become integral members of their communities, particularly in those small towns, often many kilometres from the nearest hospitals. Their families live in the community. Their children go to the school in the local area, and they go to the local church. They are members of the local sporting teams. They get involved in their community. Their days are not just nine-to-five working days; they work long hours and they're always on call. They can be exposed to situations where their patients are suffering serious life-threatening conditions and it may be some time before emergency service personnel can assist them. They are often the unsung heroes of their town. In the small regional and rural towns in my home state of Tasmania—Deloraine, Westbury, Bicheno, Smithton, Ross, Strahan, Wynyard; the list goes on—they understand this and they truly appreciate and value their local GPs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the return-of-service obligations, this bill will provide doctors with exposure to a regional, rural and remote location. My hope—and I am sure the intent behind this bill—is that these doctors will settle into their community and find a love for their community. The ultimate outcome may well be that they will understand and enjoy the value they bring to the people within the community and will then decide to stay and put some roots down for many years to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I referenced Senator Brockman's contribution earlier in my contribution last night, and I note his comment:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In Western Australia alone there are just over 300 medical vacancies, 115 of them being GP positions, in regional areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This situation is reflected across the country, with similar statistics in most states and territories. He also acknowledged:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">GPs in those country towns are of absolutely vital importance. They're such a central part of a small town's life and existence. In the city it is easy to ignore or forget or not realise what a central component to life in the bush those GPs are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot agree more with Senator Brockman's sentiments. Those of us who are fortunate enough to be able to pick up the phone and ring the doctor's surgery and get an appointment that day and feel a huge sense of disappointment if we can't get in for a couple of days should reflect on the experiences those in the rural and regional areas of this country experience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government has clearly demonstrated its support for the rural and regional communities of this country, particularly those in drought and flood affected regions. As I mentioned yesterday, the public health system in Tasmania is struggling under the increasing demand and increasing cost of delivering medical services. The coalition government is clearly working hard to make sure that we are helping people in the rural and regional communities of this country, and the changes to the bonded medical programs reform is a great initiative. I strongly urge all senators in this chamber to support this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="BK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:39</span>):  Australia's Bonded Medical Places Scheme is a sensible system because it benefits the Australian people in rural, regional and remote areas that often, as a result of their distances from capital cities and major services, struggle to attract doctors. It also benefits the new doctors themselves by allowing them to attract government funding support for their studies by promising to work for a period for the people in those needy communities. On the face of it, it is a really sensible arrangement that has various beneficiaries, but I do think it can be improved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the lure of the bigger cities and the services they provide—the shopping, entertainment, restaurants and convenient access to professional services, as well as being near to family and friends—often outweigh the apparent attractiveness of the smaller country towns and communities. I think graduate doctors who are supported by the Bonded Medical Places Scheme should be more open to creating a life in rural, remote and regional areas and enjoy the unique offerings of country living and the people that call these places home, who deserve just as much access to professional medical and health services as those in the cities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it is also important to recognise the professional aspirations of these doctors, who have often spent many years in study and professional development to become, for example, a GP. The pathway to becoming a doctor that is able to provide GP services and more in a remote community is not an easy one. The whole doctor training pathway sphere is demanding. It is very time-consuming in terms of the years that it takes from when a first-year medical student finishes their medical training, spends time in a training hospital and then completes his or her area of speciality. It's a significant commitment of at least a decade or more to become a fresh GP who can stand alone in a small community as their local doctor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bonded scheme has, since 2016, applied to about 28.5 per cent of first-year medical students in Commonwealth-supported places. It's a significant proportion of all medical students in Australia, and it should, on the face of it, result in good outcomes for country areas. Currently, in exchange for the support the students receive to achieve their medical qualifications, they are required to then work in an eligible non-metropolitan location in Australia for a total of 12 months, with that time to be completed within five years of attaining that fellowship. The Commonwealth provides 850 of these bonded medical places each year. It offers a subsidy of $22,000 per year of HECS or HELP support that does not need to be repaid if the terms of the scheme under which the bonded place was offered are met. The scheme should provide a win-win for the new doctors and also for the needy communities which otherwise would struggle to receive access to health services that are taken for granted in the cities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, a problem with this scheme is it's been apparently unable to come to a satisfactory time period for how long the medical graduates should spend in the remote locations and over what time frame that service should be fulfilled. In the past, there has been a requirement that graduates spend a period equal to the period of the medical studies, either four or six years, in these needy communities, but that wasn't successful. It's been turned back to now require graduates to fulfil a 12-month commitment in a needy community, with that service to be completed within five years of graduation. The shortcoming of this arrangement is that it could realistically mean that the new doctor could come and go from the community or communities, spending short times here and there and subsequently fulfilling the requirements of the bonded medical scheme but proving to be of no long-term benefit to the community, the local residents and their health needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The value of the Commonwealth support for the medical qualifications is of some $88,000 to $132,000, depending on whether it is a four-year postgraduate medical degree or six-year undergraduate degree. It's unacceptable that, after receiving so much financial support from the Australian taxpayer for a qualification that is well regarded and will lead to significant earnings in the private sector over the length of their career, the graduate spends such a relatively short period of time in a haphazard way repaying the Commonwealth and the taxpayer for their financial support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill makes a further change by initiating a compromised time period, increasing the required payback service to three years to be completed within 18 years from when the formal medical studies are completed. This change would also fail in providing continuity of support for the needy communities. It fails to encourage the development of relationships between the members of the community and their doctor. We all know how important it is to have longevity of relationship with your doctor and to develop trust over time. The doctor-patient relationship is one that is intimate, very personal and vital as the patient negotiates the many ups and downs and challenges of their health and family relationships over time. It is absolutely more desirable to have a doctor in a community who has taken time to become part of the community, to develop relationships and to build trust. In some cases, they meet a local, fall in love, buy a house, get married and maybe start a family. To require just three years of payback service completed over 18 years is rather counterproductive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the three years are locked in as acceptable for the payback of financial support, I would prefer to see that time completed in one three-year stint, not a broken-up mishmash of some days here and a few weeks there. I personally would like to see the graduate spend a full five years in the community once again, but that may be difficult to introduce again. The reason I suggest these stricter ideas is that these medical graduates have been given a massive opportunity courtesy of the taxpayer. It's a support mechanism that is very generous and provides valuable support towards qualifications that can reap considerable career and financial benefits into the future. It doesn't seem unreasonable that there should be a fair contribution made to the needy rural, remote and regional communities in recognition of the support given.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If police are required to be posted in remote areas for at least two years after they graduate and teachers also have a similar program, with those who spend at least four years teaching in a very remote location over a six-year period also eligible to have their Higher Education Loan Program debt remitted, these should be taken into consideration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have travelled around the country, I have spoken to many councils, mayors, communities and people living in those rural and regional areas who are crying out for doctor services. A lot of these communities are dying because they don't have the services available to them and they can't have access to health care, especially having doctors in their communities, or are spending an enormous amount of money with fly-in, fly-out doctors. Yes, something needs to be done about it—drastically. As I have said here, the taxpayer is going to be paying an enormous amount of money of between $88,000 and $132,000 in HECS fees for these medical students to get their practice. Surely it is reasonable to expect them to sign this contract in return, to give something back to Australian taxpayers by giving of their services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a shame that the five-year scheme didn't work and a lot of people didn't sign up to it. But it is about working together to keep these communities alive, because when the older generations who live in these rural and remote areas can't get the health services they need they move out. They move to the cities where they can get their health services provided to them. You have fewer people living there. Services will shut down because of fewer people living in the areas. It is going to have a flow-on effect. I do believe that extending it to a three-year period, from one year, is more favourable. One Nation will be supporting the bill.</span>

This is one of the targeted strategic responses under the Stronger Rural Health Strategy, which responds to the challenge of ensuring primary health care is accessible and available to all Australians, no matter where they live. Under the strategy, a total of $20.2 million was committed to reform the bonded medical programs. The bonded medical programs are a long-term investment in the health workforce by the Australian government. These schemes are designed to address doctor shortages across regional, rural and remote Australia and in areas of workforce shortages. Participants receive a place in a medical course at an Australian university in return for a commitment to work in underserviced areas.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill introduces a statutory scheme, known as the Bonded Medical Program, which will come into effect from 1 January 2020. The statutory scheme consolidates the existing bonded medical places and rural bonded medical scholarship schemes under a single legislative framework to progress the government's long-term view to move towards a single bonded medical scheme. The statutory scheme is clearer about the conditions applied under the program and provides greater flexibility for participants to complete their return-of-service obligation. Participants of the statutory scheme continue to have the right of internal review and now will be able to seek review of administrative decisions by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. From 1 January 2020, new participants will enter the program under the new statutory scheme, and existing participants will be able to opt in. The statutory arrangements will eventually replace the myriad complex contractual arrangements currently in place with individual participants. Statutory provisions will ensure that existing participants and future participants have access to the same suite of options and opportunities going forward. Legislative amendments will enable entrants to opt in to a statutory scheme without the need for individual contracts. It will make it significantly easier for bonded students and doctors to complete their return-of-service obligation by reducing and streamlining administrative requirements and giving more options as to when, where and how it can be completed. The reformed arrangements will provide earlier and stronger links with key professional support agencies for doctors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These improvements to the program will encourage doctors to stay working in the community where they are undertaking their return-of-service obligation beyond their obligations and ensure there are more fully-qualified Australian trained doctors working in regional, rural and remote Australia and in areas of workforce shortage. More importantly, the reforms will also better target the future bonded workforce to locations of need as demographic and workforce demands change over time. The statutory scheme will enable the collection of data for reporting and effective evaluation of the programs. At this stage, it is too early to evaluate the program's success; however, it is critical that the government, the medical profession and the Australian public have access to robust evaluation of the program outcomes to inform policy decisions into the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Without legislative reforms, existing administrative arrangements will remain outdated and contractual provisions will continue to be required and will continue to obstruct the delivery of effective and responsive targeting of the bonded medical workforce into the future. The program will become increasingly outdated, with growing frustration experienced by participants and the key stakeholder groups which support them. It questions the benefit of retaining a program which, due to its administrative arrangements, is unable to maintain currency or prepare for the future needs of participants and workforce distribution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the government's long-term view to rationalise the bonded medical programs to a single bonded medical scheme once all existing schemes have expired. It is envisaged this will occur around 2035, when all participants under the existing schemes have either completed their obligations under the program or have chosen to opt in to the new statutory scheme. The government is committed to implementing progressive and responsive administrative arrangements, which support both current and future bonded doctors keen to make a substantial contribution to better access of medical services across Australia, and I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

But I don't want that to be taken as a precedent for us changing our view on the rules around bills being exempted from the cut-off order. </span>

The amendments proposed in the Bill are urgent to ensure an equitable and consistent process for all Cashless Debit Card participants that apply to exit. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Today I rise to speak on a Bill that continues the Government's work on one of the most positive developments in welfare for decades and demonstrates our commitment to make a real difference to the lives of all Australians. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Cashless Welfare) Bill 2019 makes a number of important changes to the trial of the Cashless Debit Card that operates in the Ceduna, East Kimberley, Goldfields and Bundaberg and Hervey Bay regions. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Cashless Debit Card program is delivering significant benefits for these communities. The program has the objective of reducing immediate hardship and deprivation, reducing violence and harm, encouraging socially responsible behaviour, and reducing the likelihood that welfare recipients will remain on welfare and out of the workforce for extended periods. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The program is showing positive results. The independent evaluation of the Cashless Debit Card trial conducted by ORIMA Research found that it had "a considerable positive impact" in the communities where it had operated. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill continues the operation of the Cashless Debit Card program but improves the processes introduced through recent non-government amendments for participants to exit the program. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments were put forward by the Opposition to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Income Management and Cashless Welfare) Act</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">2019</span> in April this year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government agreed to include these Opposition amendments, however we recognised that more work and consultation was required to improve what the Opposition had put forward. The Opposition amendments allow Cashless Debit Card participants to apply for an exit from the program on or after 1 July 2019, if they can demonstrate reasonable and responsible management of their financial affairs as a primary consideration, taking into account a number of secondary factors. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments also outlined that the local community body is the decision maker for those who live in a trial area where there is a community body. For other trial areas, the Secretary of the Department of Social Services is the decision maker.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since this amendment was introduced, consultation in all four of the current Cashless Debit Card trial areas have identified concerns on the exit process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is introducing this legislation, following these consultations with communities, to ensure there is an effective, consistent and fair process for participants to exit the Cashless Debit Card program, whilst also continuing our commitment to provide the best support to people, families and communities in places where high levels of welfare dependence co-exist with high levels of social harm. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To improve the operation of processes for participants to exit the Cashless Debit Card program, the Bill proposes a number of reforms to the application process and decision making framework. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Firstly, the Bill provides that the Secretary of the Department of Social Services is the decision maker for all Cashless Debit Card exit applications. Community body representatives have stated that they do not support the exit process as it is currently designed, particularly the role of community bodies as the decision-maker. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While ongoing consultation and engagement on the impact of the new exit process will continue with communities including community bodies, providing that the Secretary of the Department of Social Services is the decision maker for all exit applications will ensure consistency and fairness for all participants of the program. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also broadens the criteria for the Cashless Debit Card exit provisions to allow the Secretary to take into account a person's ability to manage their affairs generally. For example, the Bill will enable the Secretary to require the person seeking to exit to not only meet the criteria based on financial grounds but can also take into account matters such as contact with authorities for non-financial reasons such as child protection or family violence issues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also enables the Secretary to require the person seeking to exit the Cashless Debit Card program to be able to demonstrate that they are acting in the best interest of children, family and the community such as positive school attendance outcomes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The development of this change followed consultations where stakeholders stated that any process to exit the Cashless Debit Card program should be based on a participant meeting social norms, consistent with the objectives of the program, as well as the current criteria that relates to the management of their financial affairs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is critical that we listen to this feedback and ensure that the Cashless Debit Card maintains its focus on reducing social harm and supporting vulnerable people, families and communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, the Bill also clarifies that exit applications need to in a form that is approved by the Secretary, and makes a number of minor amendments to move the exit and wellbeing exemption arrangements for the Cashless Debit Card program under one subdivision in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Social Security (Administration) Act 1999</span>, without any alteration to the existing wellbeing process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will not change the effectiveness or day-to-day operation of the program. It simply proposes administrative amendments to the exit application process and streamlines legislative provisions around Cashless Debit Card exit and exemption pathways in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Social Security (Administration) Act 1999</span>. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government remains committed to the continuation of the Cashless Debit Card, to provide a strong social welfare safety net, through reducing social harm in areas with high levels of welfare dependency and supporting vulnerable people, families and communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are committed to supporting communities that stand up and promote positive change and better outcomes for children and families and we will continue to work in partnership to ensure the Cashless Debit Card program provides the best support for vulnerable individuals within those communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is another step in this Government's efforts to sustain the positive impacts of welfare management and support communities to tackle the negative effects of welfare dependency. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I commend the Bill. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:59</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Cashless Welfare) Bill 2019. Labor has serious concerns about the cashless welfare card, and we have always opposed its rollout nationally. Labor supported the initial trial of the cashless debit card in Ceduna and East Kimberley because the community leaders indicated their support at the time. Of course, the initial support offered by communities came against a backdrop of inadequate local services and inadequate local job creation and economic development programs—the investments that government should have been making in local social and economic wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor did not support the further expansion of the trial to Bundaberg-Hervey Bay or the Goldfields because of the lack of evidence and a lack of any clear community support. Let me be clear: Labor will not support the expansion of the cashless debit card to new communities unless the community wants the card and there is informed community consent. At the election, the rollout of the cashless debit card in Bundaberg-Hervey Bay was only partially complete. Labor committed to stopping the rollout of the cashless debit card in Bundaberg-Hervey Bay and to taking a case management approach to putting in place alternative support for people already on the card, as well as investing in support services and programs that work. Labor has not been able to satisfy ourselves through our own consultations that the community desire present in the other trial sites was present in Goldfields and Bundaberg-Hervey Bay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor successfully amended a bill in the Senate in April this year to allow people participating in the cashless debit card trial sites to get off the cashless debit card if they are effectively managing their affairs. Labor's amendment required community panels, which are established in some cashless debit card trial sites, to be the decision-maker. This was consistent with existing arrangements for reducing the portion of a person's income quarantined on the cashless debit card. The government's subsequent consultation with the community panels found that they did not want to be this decision-maker out of concern for the pressure that could be placed on panel members by members of the community who apply to get off the cashless debit card. On this basis, Labor will not oppose this bill—it is consistent with the amendment we successfully made earlier in the year and it will give people a pathway off the card. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will amend the exit criteria under current legislation to allow for a broader consideration of opt-out criteria for persons participating in the cashless welfare card. The bill will create a single administrative process for the Department of Social Services, DSS, to make decisions about people getting off the cashless debit card. The bill also combines the pre-existing welfare exemption which allows DSS to exempt a person from the cashless debit card if it is a threat to their physical, mental or emotional health, with the exit pathway established by Labor's amendment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, the bill clarifies that exit applications need to be made in a form that is approved by the secretary of DSS and expands the wellbeing exemption provisions so they apply more broadly across all regions. This bill will ultimately assist participants who are managing their affairs well and who want to get off the card. We understand hundreds of people are seeking an exemption from the trial and have already approached DSS about the opt-out process. This shows there is strong community support for people being able to get off the cashless debit card. Labor has some concerns about the operation of certain provisions in this bill, and we will move amendments to address some of these.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cashless debit card has been running too long. It is no longer a trial, and it is time the government produced some real evidence about the effectiveness of the card and reassessed community support in each trial area. That is why Labor moved a second reading amendment in the House calling on the government to: firstly, table a report in parliament by the end of the year, making clear whether or not there is continuing community support in any of the trial sites for the cashless debit card; secondly, table a wraparound service plan in the parliament by the end of the year, explaining how the government has boosted community services in the trial sites and what increased investment will be made in the future; and, thirdly, make the cashless debit card voluntary from 30 January 2020 unless there is clear local community support and consent for the card. This is an incredibly important point—the government simply cannot continue to impose this card on communities where there is not clear support, and they cannot continue to impose it in the absence of evidence about the card's effectiveness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this context, Labor's future position on the cashless debit card is clear. We will not support the extension of the cashless debit card trial sites, or the further rollout of the cashless debit card, unless the government can demonstrate there is clear and genuine local community support. The cashless debit card is over-simplified. Labor will move similar amendments in the committee stage debate on this bill, setting out a process for people to come off the card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the introduction of the cashless debit card trials, the government has continually failed to be up-front about the full cost of implementing the cashless debit card. Hopefully, this is something the minister can shed some light on in the course of this debate. The government have already spent $34 million on the cashless debit card, and the budget papers show they're planning to spend $128.8 million over the forward estimates, including on new sites and the rollout of the cashless debit card across the Northern Territory. That's over $160 million that instead could have been allocated to employment and economic development, early intervention services, and to drug and alcohol treatment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was reported in mid-2017 that the cost per participant of the cashless debit card exceeded $10,000 per participant. The same year the Auditor-General found that the annual running costs of the cashless debit card would be over $3,700 per participant. The problem is that we have never had a proper evaluation into what better outcomes would be possible if this money was invested differently. This is incredibly concerning, particularly when you consider that the Auditor-General found there was no evidence that the cashless debit card was effective. In addition, Labor has become increasingly concerned about the government's reliance on the deeply flawed ORIMA evaluation to justify the cashless debit card. The Auditor-General's examination of the cashless debit card found that there was no evidence that the card was effective and found deep inconsistencies in the ORIMA evaluation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a Senate inquiry into the cashless debit card earlier this year, the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs heard evidence that in some trial sites the cashless debit card has now been in operation for so long that the opportunity for a proper piece of evaluation to be conducted has passed. There is clear evidence the card is not maintaining community support, even in areas where some people might have initially been in favour of the card. Indigenous leader and foundation chair in Australian Indigenous Studies at the University of Melbourne, Professor Marcia Langton, has said the cashless debit card is a failure. Professor Langton said, 'Because the local community is not involved in implementing the policy, the policy failed.' One of the community leaders who initially supported the introduction of the trial, Mr Desmond Hill, has since withdrawn his support. Mr Hill told the recent inquiry one of the conditions community leaders had when agreeing to the East Kimberley becoming a trial site was that people would be able to apply to leave the trial. Another Indigenous elder in the East Kimberley, Ian Trust, who remains a supporter, told the committee he was not opposed to people being able to come off the card in some circumstances. That is why it is important that people can get off the cashless debit card, even in areas where the trial may be supported by the community. This bill will allow people to come off the cashless debit card, and the fact is many of those people should not have been on the card in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, Labor will not oppose this bill because it implements an amendment we made some months ago and provides a pathway off the card. We will not support the extension of the cashless debit card trial sites or the further rollout of the cashless debit card unless the government can demonstrate there is clear and genuine local community support. Labor will take an evidence based approach to this policy and to income management. We will not go down the US path of supporting essentially a food stamp system, where people are identified and shamed in public by the card as being on social security, where children are teased and ostracised at school, where people can't buy a second-hand fridge on Gumtree, shop at a roadside farm stall or buy food at a market—all because this conservative government would rather hand out tens of millions of dollars to a private company to run the cashless debit card and to set up a privatised, parallel welfare system to be imposed by this government on people regardless of their circumstances or how they are managing their affairs. Australians have a right to adequate social security. It should be considered by all sides a basic characteristic of a fair and civil society. We will not demonise social security recipients like this government does. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:11</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services (Administration) Amendment (Cashless Welfare) Bill 2019. This bill makes changes to the exit and wellbeing exemption arrangements for people to exit the cashless debit card trials. These are necessary because the current processes aren't workable. These changes relate to the so-called exit or opt-out provisions, which were rushed through the Senate by the government and the ALP together in return for the ALP's supporting the government's extension of the cashless debit card trial sites. That happened in April. There was no time to debate the bill itself or the amendments. It was obvious from the start, by reading the amendments that were rushed through, that the exit provisions wouldn't work. But that really didn't matter to the government or the opposition because they just wanted to see the extension of the cashless debit card rushed through without adequate scrutiny so that they could extend the trials for another 12 months. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was rushed through before the election. Unfortunately there was no way to debate those changes, as I said, because the gag was applied to a number of bills that were rushed through in April, before the election. The Senate did not have time to adequately scrutinise the amendments. I would hope that, if we had been given time, the fact that they weren't workable would have been realised. What has happened now is that we have a whole lot of people that are in limbo. I will come back to that in a minute. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have here a bill that makes a number of changes, including removing the role of the unelected, hand-picked community bodies in assessing a person's exit applications. It makes the secretary of the Department of Social Services the decision-maker for the exit applications. It also amends some of the exit criteria and clarifies that exit applications are to be made through a form approved by the secretary of the department. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will come to the discussion of the amendments shortly, but let me first be very clear: the Greens continue their opposition to income management and the cashless debit card trials and the cashless debit card. This is a punitive approach that unfairly discriminates against First Nations communities, particularly, and does not work, despite the government's rhetoric. Last night in the adjournment I articulated and spoke about a number of accounts from people that are subject to the cashless debit card and how it's making their lives worse, not better. The cashless debit card is not supported by lots of people in the broader community and people in the trial sites. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I move a second reading amendment to the legislation:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the end of the motion, add "but the Senate calls on the Government to abandon compulsory income management and the Cashless Debit Card".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People on the card have articulated how they feel demonised, stigmatised. People have been spat on and called druggies, and children have been bullied at school because their parents are on the card. The card restricts human rights and unfairly targets people on income support. We do not support the cashless debit card. We don't support income management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government falsely claim the success of the card and of income management. Their own evaluations, if read clearly and properly, don't support those claims, even if you ignore the fact that the methodology is flawed. I have, many times in this place, gone through the flaws in the evaluation process and the way the government falsely claim that those evaluations show the success of income management. They ignore the voices of the community such as those that I quoted last night in my adjournment speech. Those people, as I said, talk about being shamed, being demonised and the fact that they have a lot of problems with the card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory, through the Northern Territory intervention, has had income management for 12 long years. Does anybody seriously claim that the situation in the Northern Territory has been stabilised, that it has improved, when we see an escalating number of children going into out-of-home care still and we still have outrageous youth justice interaction problems and problems with the youth justice system? No, of course they don't. In 2007 the then Howard government made what turned out to be false claims about the situation in the Northern Territory to justify the dog whistling of the Northern Territory intervention. Those claims have not been proved to be correct. None of the things that they claimed would happen through the intervention and income management have in fact happened, which the evaluation of the Northern Territory intervention clearly showed. The hearing into the rollout of the cashless debit card in Hinkler clearly showed something similar. The authors of that report highlighted the findings from the Northern Territory intervention evaluation, which does not support the government's claims of success.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens remain strongly opposed to the cashless debit card and income management. However, there are now hundreds of people in limbo because the application process that was rushed through this place doesn't work, and there is actually no process in place to assess their applications. The wellbeing exemption process is a mess. My office has tried to help many people who have applied for the wellbeing exemption and been extremely frustrated by the process. The wellbeing exemption process has been in place for a long time. For opt-out and exit there are no processes in place, but we've helped a number of people through the wellbeing exemption process. One person was told, 'You need to be on the card first, so then you can prove that it's adversely impacted your mental health.' In other words, the department at the time was saying, 'You need to be sicker before we can take you off it.' It's ridiculous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are supporting this legislation, although I have some strong concerns about it which I will articulate. We will be supporting this process around exemption. I'm being really clear: we do not support the cashless debit card, but we support improving the exemption process, because we want to help what we've been told, through our community contacts, is about 400 people who have applied for the opt-out process and are in limbo. We want to make sure there is a process in place, so we are supporting this particular bit of the legislation. However, I have some amendments to the process, because we think it can still be improved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the minister for the way that she has undertaken the consultation to get this process fixed. I think that she's been very open to what we had to say. She didn't take everything on board, I must say, but it was a welcome process because it enabled us to look at the legislation and point at some of the issues that we had. Once the legislation was released, we listened very strongly to stakeholders, who have had things to say even in the short time since this legislation was tabled last Thursday. There are a lot of people who are keenly interested in the cashless debit card trials and income management, and they have responded very quickly to our reaching out for their comments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unsurprisingly, there have been a number of issues with the criteria that have been raised, and I will go through some of those issues that we have now with the process. Having said that, I will reiterate that I was pleased that we could talk to the government about some of these issues. I just wish they'd gone a lot further. I will say now, too, that I have a series of questions. Although these changes are in place to help the process roll more smoothly, I think there are a lot of questions about how the process will work, so I'd like to get the answers on record in order for people to understand how the process will work when they use this legislation to opt out and also for the wellbeing exemptions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the issues that I still think are problematic are under section 124PHB(3). It says that a person wishing to exit the trial will be assessed according to the following:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a) the person can demonstrate reasonable and responsible management of the person's affairs (including financial affairs), taking into account all of the following:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(i) the interest of any children for whom the person is responsible;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(ii) whether the person was convicted of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, or was serving a sentence of imprisonment for such an offence, at any time in the last 12 months …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that this is a change from what originally went through this place, which was about whether the person 'has a likelihood of engaging in any unlawful activity'. That was totally subjective. It wasn't measurable. It was dependent on whether somebody in the community—because at this stage it was about the community panels and the community bodies—thought someone was going to carry out any unlawful activity. So I do acknowledge that that's an improvement on what was there. We do, however, have concerns that it's 'convicted of an offence' rather than 'convicted of a serious offence', so I do have an amendment to make to emphasise that it's about a serious offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The criteria also includes:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(iii) risks of homelessness;</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anybody reading those will see that a lot of those are also very subjective, so that's why I wish to clarify these issues during the debate of the whole—so people are clear about how these criteria will be assessed. We actually want to take out a whole lot of the criteria and just leave the 'managing financial affairs' part there. That's another amendment that I'll be putting in during the Committee of the Whole process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, let's look at these criteria. For a start, some of these criteria would well contradict the wellbeing exemption. If having poor mental health, for example, qualifies you for a wellbeing exemption, will it then qualify you for a wellbeing exemption, or does it mean that you are caught up under the criteria that talks about the health and safety of a person in the community? The problem here is that we are at risk of the criteria for the opt-out exemption contradicting the process through the wellbeing exemption, so we need to make sure that that is clarified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many, many people responded over the weekend to the criteria, telling us they thought the exit criteria were incredibly patronising and onerous and that they believe they're based on ideological grounds rather than on being workable. These exit provisions require trial participants to provide evidence that goes above and beyond the objectives of the trial. It is unfair that trial participants are being forced to jump through these hoops that no other income support recipients are subject to all because they are unlucky enough to live in the so-called cashless debit card trial sites. Let me say that people who are living on incredibly low payments, such as $277.86 per week on Newstart, are some of the best money managers around. It is objectionable that the government thinks that just because you're on income support you can't manage your finances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people on income support payments, especially on low payments, find it difficult to provide evidence that satisfies these criteria. Let's take the criteria for risk of homelessness. The chronic lack of housing, especially in remote communities, means that First Nations families often experience housing overcrowding. This will work against First Nations people wanting to exit the card. A person's risk of homelessness could also be exacerbated by being on the cashless debit card. I've heard repeated accounts of people's rent payments bouncing back into their accounts, because of the Indue card, and not being paid on time. How is it fair to assess a person on their risk of homelessness when the card itself makes it difficult to maintain a good rental history?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To exit the card, a person also needs to demonstrate they have not been convicted of any offences in the last 12 months. This could see someone charged with minor offences like jaywalking, petty theft or graffiti excluded from exiting the card. First Nations people will again be disadvantaged because of the institutionalised and systemic racism they experience through our justice system, and virtually every day of their lives. We know that First Nations people are 13 times more likely to be in prison than non-Indigenous people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A trial participant's exit application will also be assessed against the health and safety of the person and the community. This is incredibly unfair. How can a person prove the health and safety of their community, and how can they be held responsible for it? Individuals cannot, and should not, be held responsible for the health and safety of their community in return for getting off the card. It also directly contradicts the wellbeing exemptions that allow a person to exit the card based on their physical and mental health issues. It begs the question as to whether, as I articulated earlier, a person's health will determine whether they stay on the card or exit the card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also have strong concerns about the criteria around a person's employment or efforts to obtain work. The cashless debit card operates in many regional areas that are suffering from thin or non-existent labour markets. The focus on proving employment also reflects the government's devaluing of unpaid care work. Unpaid care often takes place in private and is not able to be verified by documentary evidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, the exit criteria are not measurable or objective, and I will move an amendment to have these removed. If that fails, I've got a lot of questions to ask about how they will operate. The objectives remain open to interpretation and allow the secretary of the Department of Social Services to exercise extensive discretion over a person's exit application, and that remains a strong concern for many people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite being fully aware of these flaws, the government has not moved to make significant improvements to the exit criteria. When we are discussing these during the Committee of the Whole, I will urge the minister to clarify how these criteria will be interpreted, what evidence will be acceptable and how will it be verified? There are also significant problems with the role of the health and community worker in the reconsideration of the exit applications. Section 124PHB(8) stipulates:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If a health or community worker considers that it is necessary for the person who is the subject of a determination under subsection (3) to be a trial participant for medical or safety reasons, the worker may request the Secretary to reconsider the determination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I think the way that is worded shows some improvement, I am concerned that it doesn't stipulate that the health or community worker has to have a professional relationship with the person that they're talking about. Otherwise, any member of the community who happens to be a health or community worker may register an issue with the department to say, 'We want that person reconsidered,' having no justification for that at all, other than it may be their opinion. I'm deeply concerned about the way this could be interpreted and will seek clarification from the government that the worker will be expected to have a professional connection with the person they're working with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike some people, we are in fact pleased that the community bodies have been taken out of this process. Community bodies are unelected. The government has chosen the people there. Nobody knows who they are. I've said this repeatedly in this place and called for those names to be released so that people in the community can know who's judging them. It is totally unfair that the participants of this trial do not know who the people are that are making the decisions in either the community panel or the community reference group, where they exist, in both Hinkler and Kalgoorlie. We don't know if there are participants, for example, on the reference groups. We understand there are businesses. So businesses get a say over the control of people's lives? This is outrageous!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People in the government will continue to get up and say how fantastic the card is. They obviously haven't spoken to the people that are suffering under this card—being demonised, stigmatised, spat on and called druggies who can't manage their financial affairs, when they have proven that they can manage their financial affairs. Income management stigmatises people. It is discriminatory. It should be abandoned now. We will not support any continuation of the CDC.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="30484" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BROCKMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  I rise to make a contribution on the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Cashless Welfare) Bill 2019. I note with some trepidation that my new colleague from Western Australia Matt O'Sullivan, who gave an absolutely wonderful first speech last night and who is full bottle on this topic, is speaking after me. Hopefully, I don't mess up too badly, Senator O'Sullivan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something I have taken an interest in, as a senator from Western Australia, since my time began in this place. I was fortunate enough, as an incoming senator, to be on the Community Affairs Committee, and one of my first committee responsibilities was to travel to Kalgoorlie with the Community Affairs Committee and talk to the local community about this very issue. One of the things that was very clear from that time in Kalgoorlie was the sheer desperation that parts of rural and regional areas in particular face in relation to issues of drug abuse, alcohol abuse, other addiction problems and social dysfunction in general. That desperation was voiced by so many people—people from non-Indigenous backgrounds, people from Indigenous backgrounds and, literally, the taxi driver who took me from the airport in Kalgoorlie to the hearing. The desperation and the desire to give people some hope was palpable. In working with the member for O'Connor, Rick Wilson, a good friend of mine, on the cashless debit card trial in Kalgoorlie—and I know that Senator O'Sullivan, in his previous role, also played a part in the development of the cashless debit card—we've seen that granting of hope. We've see people grasp the opportunity to improve their lives that is presented by the cashless debit card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand those opposite have some ideological objections to the underlying idea of the cashless debit card. However, that granting of hope to people in those communities is something that shouldn't be diminished and shouldn't be put aside on the basis of an ideological view of the world. The cashless debit card is about giving people the chance to get control of their own lives again—of their own spending. Of the stories that have come to me from the Kalgoorlie trial, there is one of a young woman who has been able to get control of her financial situation and has been able to buy a car, for the first time in her life, and maintain the operating costs on that car. There are stories of shopkeepers in the town of Coolgardie who have seen families coming in and buying food for their children's lunch for the first time ever. This is an opportunity for people to take control of their financial situation in the face of the absolutely debilitating impacts of drug and alcohol abuse in particular.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a community led program. I think that is something that should not be ignored. I know the genesis, particularly in Kalgoorlie, in the Goldfields region, of the cashless debit card. This was not government in Canberra picking a spot; this was community groups in Kalgoorlie and the surrounding areas coming to their local member, Rick Wilson, advocating to be part of this trial. There was extensive consultation within the area involved. There was a postal survey that went out to 18,000 Goldfields households and came back with 85 per cent support for the trial. There was advocacy from local community groups. I spoke to the local mayor; I spoke to the CEO of the local shire, and to the Shire of Laverton and the Shire of Leonora—and I should point out that there is significant Indigenous representation in those local government authorities. These local communities wanted a circuit-breaker. They wanted something to change the dynamic in their community, and that is what the cashless debit card has provided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another point—and I have made it in this place before, but it is very important—is that we are looking here at amendments to the regime, and that is because these are trials. This is a process of constant improvement. We know that this is something we need to look at. We need to see what works, and we need to change what doesn't and try again. This is not something that we as a government, as a society, can afford to get wrong. There is too much at stake. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government believe in a fair go for all, and we believe in putting vulnerable people first. But we also have to spend taxpayers' money in a responsible way. We have high expectations of people who are on welfare and we know that those people, who are often in desperate circumstances, do want to regain control of their lives in the face of addiction and want to make a better life for themselves and their families. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cashless debit card does look and operate like a regular EFTPOS card; however, it can't be used to withdraw cash, gamble or purchase alcohol. Recipients receive 80 per cent of their payments on the card, with the remaining 20 per cent placed in a bank account. The card can be used to pay for everyday expenses such as rent, mortgages and bills; to buy groceries; and to pay for medical appointments, car registration and similar things. The cashless debit card is a fee-free account. People can check their balances and transaction histories for free, and replace lost or stolen cards at no cost. The cashless debit cards provide effective usability for participants, with the ability to transfer funds between cashless debit card accounts and to access online shopping. It's accepted at something like just under a million EFTPOS terminals nationally. It is a user-friendly and innovative way for people to receive income support payments, and we continue to improve it all the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are currently four trial areas: the Ceduna region in South Australia; the East Kimberley region in Western Australia; the Goldfields region, which I have spoken a little about, in Western Australia; and most recently the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay region in Queensland. All of these areas face very different challenges, which is why—again, this was community driven—the government chose them. In the Goldfields region, the card is often thought of as directly impacting more on the Indigenous community there. However, it is always important to note that, of the welfare recipients who are on the cashless debit card program, 50 per cent are actually non-Indigenous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a situation where Kalgoorlie is different to the East Kimberley in terms of its demographic profiles. Bundaberg and Hervey Bay are different again. It's a much younger demographic and targeted as such. This is a government that is committed to seeing what works on the ground and making sure that the rollout is effective—that we monitor the rollout and that we act on the information that we are gaining back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the first of the three sites the program applied to all working-age welfare participants, but in Hervey Bay and Bundaberg it targeted those under 35. So, again, we are seeking to gain the information on where this is most effective and how we can use this as a tool to help people take control of their own lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are around 11,200 people on the cashless card trial across those four sites. Again, this has been developed in close partnership with community leaders and looks to address those devastating impacts of drug and alcohol that I've talked about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has talked about and committed to expanding the cashless debit card to the Northern Territory and Cape York regions of Queensland in 2020. Again, that will offer another snapshot into another set of issues at the local level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do we need this bill? This bill allows the secretary of the Department of Social Services to be the decision-maker for all cashless debit card exit applications and broadens the criteria for the exit provisions to allow the secretary to take into account a person's ability to manage their affairs generally, including their financial affairs. The bill clarifies that exit applications need to be made in a form that is approved by the secretary and expands the wellbeing exemption provisions so they apply more broadly across the regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Changes are needed to fix the exit process that was introduced by the opposition earlier this year as an amendment to legislation that extended the cashless debit card program beyond 30 June 2019. Following the passage of these amendments feedback from community representatives indicated a lack of support for the new exit process and particularly the role of community bodies as decision-makers. Community stakeholders also indicated that any process to exit the program should be based on a participant meeting social norms as well as the current criteria relating to financial management. Without the critical support of the community bodies and agreement to make decisions on these applications it is not possible to implement the exit process as provided for under the current provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The exit application process is accessible to all participants. The criteria to be considered by the decision-maker is outlined in the legislation. This criteria is applied to each participant's own circumstances; however, it may vary. Therefore, a phone interview will ensure that participants have an opportunity for a fair and equitable assessment by taking into account these differences at a time that suits them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will amend the exit criteria to allow broader consideration of a person's affairs, including their financial affairs. This allows full consideration of all factors, such as the impact on children and family safety. This change to the criteria is in line with the feedback from consultation with community stakeholders and is consistent with the broader social objectives of the cashless debit card program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will amend the exit process to reflect the feedback from consultation and to require applications to be made in a form approved by the secretary. The amendments also enable the secretary to make a determination in relation to applications, which will be a reviewable decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will also move the exit and wellbeing exemption arrangements under one subdivision of the Social Security (Administration) Act. This removes differences in decision-making processes, increasing consistency and fairness for participants across trial areas, regardless of whether a person is a participant in a trial area where there is a community body in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">CDC participants can be also be exited from the trial if they were incorrectly placed on the trial or if they no longer meet the participation criteria. This is different to the wellbeing exemption process, where a CDC participant could be exempted from the trial if being on the trial could pose a serious risk to their mental, physical or emotional wellbeing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just briefly in winding up, I think it is important to note that the government did commit, as part of this process, to ongoing reviews of the cashless debit card in place. The first of those, from the University of Adelaide, was published in February this year. It looked in particular at the Goldfields region. It has a section, which I want to go through briefly, on the early impacts of the cashless debit card. I'll read out some of the observations. It says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">... a majority of respondents were of the opinion that early impacts were starting to be observed. These impacts primarily centred on alcohol and drug use and misuse, child welfare and well-being, spending and financial management, financial abuse, crime and domestic violence, and support services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Levels of substance misuse (and especially alcohol misuse) were reported by many respondents to have reduced in the Goldfields since the introduction of the CDC. Likewise, alcohol-related anti-social behaviour and crime had also decreased.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I then drove to Ceduna to experience it firsthand and make my own observations. I spoke to people ... I spoke to the deputy mayor, I spoke to retailers in the town and townspeople and got the same picture: they were glad that it had been introduced. They said there were some complaints, but even some who initially had been opposed to the card had really come around to say that life generally was better, particularly for those living on the streets.</span>

Council has formally adopted and supports the cashless welfare card because we see this as an opportunity to try and do something. We have had up to 50 agencies come into Laverton to try and address these social issues, and we do have our Laverton inter-agency group meetings to come up with solutions to try and stem this violence.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will at least give us breathing space to do something and sit back and analyse where things can be done better and what we can do better as a community. We see it every single day. We have done everything we can as a community to try and solve some of these issues that we've got.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I could go on. There are many more. We heard from Mr Jim Epis, chief executive of the Shire of Leonora. We heard from business owners in Kalgoorlie. We heard from community groups in the Goldfields region. People wanted the chance to try and change the social dynamic, the dysfunction that was occurring in their community. It is a desperately sad situation. I've heard ministers on this side repeatedly say that the cashless debit card is not a silver bullet, and we on this side all understand that. It is not of itself the solution; however, it can be a part of a broader solution. It can be the circuit-breaker that helps people take back control of their lives. I support the bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'SULLIVAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:49</span>):  I rise in support of the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Cashless Welfare) Bill 2019. Last night, it was my great privilege to be able to speak for the first the time here in the Senate. In that speech, I spoke about my involvement with the cashless debit card in its early formations. I thought I'd take the time now to talk a little bit about the journey and the genesis—how the whole idea of the cashless debit card actually came about—because I was part of the very early discussions with some of the communities where it's now being trialled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Brockman said that I am a full bottle on this. Well, I think that's very kind and generous, but I think it's a little overstated. The reality is the full bottles on this are the communities. They are the ones that understand the depth and breadth of the importance of this card and the support that's provided with it—the extra supports of services that come with the card. The government is not delivering just that form of administered welfare payments, the social services payments that people receive. There are other supports that are there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cashless debit card came about after a review by Mr Andrew Forrest from Fortescue Metals Group and the Minderoo Foundation, where I was working at the time. He was asked by the then Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, to undertake a review of the Indigenous jobs and training system. In doing the review, having gone around the country and speaking with many people—there were town hall meetings, lots of consultations around the country and about 400 different submissions as well—what became very apparent was that the focus on training and employment was important and that we needed to bring some reforms into that space. I spoke about that last night in my speech. What became really apparent was if people for six out of seven nights are drunk and affected by drugs then there's no chance of training those people for jobs, even for jobs that are there or where there's a demand for jobs. And so there was a real cry from communities to try something that was different, to try something that could help people get that circuit-breaker.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Brockman said that no-one in this place, in the government or anywhere, even in the communities, is saying that the cashless debit card would be a silver bullet, but it is a circuit-breaker and it does provide an opportunity. We had a look at what was available. Is there a technology solution that could help? Years ago, you wouldn't have been able to do this, but technology has advanced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw that the Basics Card was in operation in the Northern Territory. It's a similar model. It works similarly, but there are a few important differences between the Basics Card and the cashless debit card. One of the problems with the Basics Card, which all welfare recipients across the Northern Territory and other parts in disparate locations across the country experience, is that the merchant has to install a separate terminal at their point of sale. In the Northern Territory in particular, you'd go into the grocery store, into the supermarket, and there would only be one line that had the Basics Card terminal installed, and it was the Basics Card terminal. Of course, you'd see all of the welfare recipients lined up at one terminal and everyone else lined up at the other aisles. It created a stigma for people. It was obvious who was on welfare and who was not, so it wasn't empowering. It wasn't helping people. It was actually driving down the despair further. If you're on welfare, it's a challenging circumstance, and no-one debates that. But what we don't need to do is add further stigma or a further issue to their lives, and the Basics Card was, in many ways, doing that. We took it to the technology providers, EFTPOS, Visa and Mastercard, and had a discussion with them. We got the banks together and said, 'Is there a way we could use one of the mainstream schemes, Visa, Mastercard or EFTPOS, to provide a more ubiquitous program so that the card could work anywhere in Australia, not just at those locations the merchant had installed a terminal to interface with their point of sale?' We wanted to find a system that would enable people to go freely about their lives, conduct their business, buy the things that they needed—their groceries—pay their electricity bill and pay for whatever they needed in a pretty unrestricted way, with just the merchants that sell alcohol and gambling products blocked, and of course ensure that there's no purchase of drugs and perhaps prohibit taking cash out at the ATM.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a real breakthrough. It couldn't have been done 10 years ago. This is something that was new, and we thought it was worth trialling. So, we took it to a number of the communities that are now trial communities, and a few others. There were a few that rejected it; they didn't want it. At the time Geraldton, for example, wasn't prepared to bring about the trial. But in the communities of the East Kimberley and Ceduna, the leadership group within those communities, said: 'Look, we think this is worth a go; we think this is worth trialling.' So, at Generation One, at Minderoo, where I was working at the time, we took it to the government. The government worked with us and said, 'Well, if you can actually demonstrate that the support is real, that there are actually people who want to see this happen, where we could break the cycle of welfare-fuelled alcohol, drug and gambling purchases, then this might be worth having a look at.' So we did. We got the support of those communities. They were a part of bringing delegations here into this place, speaking with crossbench members, the government and the opposition about the kind of support that was there within these communities. The government moved to implement this program, and it's been running now for several years across the East Kimberley and Ceduna, and now into the Goldfields and Hinkler. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a circuit-breaker. It by no means deals with all the challenges. I talked to the senior sergeant of police up in Kununurra, who said to me, 'Instead of having five continuous nights and days, after welfare payments hit, of drinking issues and all sorts of social problems that come with excessive drinking, we might now have only one or two nights.' So it becomes a circuit-breaker. I had the opportunity to go to many of these communities over a number of years, long before the cashless debit card and now since the implementation of the card, and these places really are different. They're very, very different. They're not perfect; you still see issues; you still hear from the nursing staff and police and others. We know there are still some problems that have to be addressed within these communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To me, employment is clearly the way to deal with this, because when someone has to take the responsibility of getting up for work and the responsibility of providing for their family, they make better choices, because they can't be staying out late every night, using all their money to purchase copious amounts of alcohol and drugs and not putting that into their family. People take responsibility. So this is a real opportunity, and people seize that opportunity when they've got a job. That really is the focus that we need to have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation and the amendment here deals with an important thing that the community is looking for. As Senator Brockman said, this is a trial. This is about moving and adapting to the program and how it's working and how it can be improved. Here we have a situation where community members are saying, 'We think there are circumstances where people can demonstrate that they don't need to be on the cashless debit card and they can transition off that.' The government's listened to what the community is saying. There was a part of the legislation that established a reference group that people would have to go to and make their case, and then that would be able to take them off the cashless debit card. But the community responded, saying: 'Actually, we don't want to be set up against our communities. We don't want to have that sort of involvement. We just want to be participants within our community and not have that sort of role.' So I think this amendment is a very important amendment. It takes pressure away from community members within the group. This is an important change that we would make here today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to make the card even better—it's never going to be perfect—we can invest in the technology that the card operates on. At the moment, it works by blocking an entire merchant. If you use that card at a grocery store, a supermarket, it will work. If you use it at a petrol station, it will work. If you use it to put new tyres on your car, it will work. This is not just in communities where the trial is in operation, but anywhere across Australia and, in fact, the world. However, if you use that card at a liquor store, it won't work. If you try to use it at a casino, to purchase some gambling products, it won't work. This is anywhere across Australia, not just within those trial communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is: if you want to see it go into other regions where you don't have these discrete communities, there are mixed merchants that sell both alcohol and groceries through the same point-of-sale system. What we really need, to enable it to expand and go further and to take away any of that stigma that is attached to it, is the ability to limit the sale of particular items. So we need to ratchet up the scale of the technology to limit items rather than an entire merchant. One of the problems is: you can go to a mixed merchant, or even an existing merchant that's allowed—for example, at the service station—and buy a gift card and take that gift card that you purchased in the service station, or the post office or wherever you can buy gift cards, straight down to a liquor store to purchase a trolley full of booze. It's defeating the purpose of the program. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll be working with the minister and the government to look at ways of developing the technology to improve its efficiency, to improve how it works, so we can restrict the sale of particular items rather than entire merchants. You certainly wouldn't want to restrict the ability to shop at a supermarket—it has basic provisions that people are going to need—and we can't stop people purchasing fuel from a service station just because they also sell gift cards. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the trial communities they've got around it with a manual override process, by limiting the sale of particular items. But if we're going to take it broadly we need to invest in the technology. This will further support the communities and the intent of the program, which is not to limit people's lives, not to impose upon them any unnecessary, undue, process. They will be able to go about their lives freely, without any encumbrance, and provide for their families. We've seen some great results in the trial communities. The key finding from the initial evaluation was that 41 per cent of those who reported drinking before the trial were now drinking less, while 37 per cent reported binge drinking less frequently. It doesn't mean they've stopped; it just means there's been a reduction. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spent many years as a youth worker, and I have never seen a program have such a dramatic social impact. There's no amount of counselling or support that you could provide—I've worked with many young people who have had issues with this. I've never seen such a dramatic change in a community brought about, as we've seen in this community, with that sort of result. Of participants who reported that they were gambling, 48 per cent said that they were gambling less. Of those who said that they were taking illegal drugs before the program commenced, 48 per cent said that they reported using illegal drugs less often.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The evaluation also found widespread spillover benefits from the card. Forty per cent of participants surveyed that they were better able to look after their children. Forty-five per cent of participants were better able to save money. There was a decrease in requests for emergency food relief and financial assistance in the Ceduna region, and merchants reported increased purchases of baby items and food, clothing, shoes, toys and other goods for children. In the Wyndham store that I went into, for some reason, there's been a big run on fish fingers. There were copious amounts of fish fingers being sold. It's often the food of choice for my children, I've got to say, when you're just trying to put a quick meal together on a Sunday night! The point is people are using more money for important support for their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we're also hearing from teachers and schools that they're having to provide less food at the breakfast programs in Wyndham primary schools. Instead of kids coming and filling up because they haven't had any food at home, there are fewer kids now coming to school needing that service and assistance—that wonderful program that's run in the schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, this is a small amendment to this program, but it is very important. This is something that is in response to what the community is asking for. None of us here in this place are necessarily experts on this. The people we need to listen to are those who are on the ground. When the people in the community are saying that this is something that we need to further improve the program and to ensure that it has the best opportunity for success then that's something that we should respond to. I commend the bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  I have supported the cashless debit card as an effective means of reducing the impact of alcohol and drug use since its inception, because it works. I took part in the committee inquiry hearing in Kalgoorlie in 2017 and heard from people about the level of dysfunction which drug and alcohol abuse bring to a community. I have spoken to community representatives since about the positive impact that the card has brought. I have heard about children being sent to school regularly. I've heard about families shopping together and filling their supermarket trolleys with food—a new experience as a result of the card. I've heard that the level of social disruption has fallen. Domestic violence has lessened. The evidence on the ground shows that the cashless debit card makes a difference in improving lives and improving communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is borne out by a number of research projects. The baseline report into the Goldfields trial supports these earlier findings. There continues to be a decrease in drug and alcohol issues; decreases in violent crime and antisocial behaviour; improvements in child health and wellbeing; and ongoing and even strengthening community support for the income management measures. The independent evaluation of the card trial in the Ceduna and East Kimberley regions also shows the effectiveness of the trial to reduce alcohol abuse and gambling, which also eats up income, in many welfare-dependent communities. The overall conclusion of the research was that the card has had a considerably positive impact, including that 41 per cent of those surveyed reported drinking less frequently, 48 per cent used drugs less frequently and 48 per cent of gamblers gambled less often. Given the positive outcomes that the cashless debit card has been shown to have, I cannot see how anyone would not support the continuation of the trials and a broader rollout in other areas where drug and alcohol abuse and social dysfunction are rife.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is strong support for the introduction of the cashless debit card from community leaders, local government and key community based organisations—for example, the Far West Aboriginal Communities Leaders Group, which recently released this statement:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are now into the third year of the implementation of the cashless debit card rollout in the far west region of South Australia, which covers Oak Valley, Yalata, Scotdesco, Koonibba and Ceduna. We acknowledge and recognise the work done by all our communities and other areas of Australia that have implemented the cashless debit card. It has not been an easy feat but we have united together, influenced the design of the trial and made a real lasting effect in numerous communities, all with unique experiences and individualised benefits. We recognise the government officials and ministers, both current and former, who have stayed true to their word in co-designing the trial with us rather than for us. Our region remains in direct contact with ministers and departmental staff and, furthermore, we encourage the Prime Minister and other ministers to visit our communities and see firsthand the results of the policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I went to Kalgoorlie for the Senate inquiry. I listened to community leaders, councillors, mayors and community elders, and basically the majority wanted the card. The only real issue was communication. They felt that there was a need for the card, especially in Kalgoorlie. You know that it comes down to tough love. I listen to the Greens speaking on this issue in this chamber, and they talk about someone's human rights being taken away from them. I think we need to look at the real issues. The government has introduced the cashless debit card because of certain communities—and let's be honest about it and not back away from it; these communities are basically Aboriginal. That's what they are. That's where the real problem is. Everyone skirts around the whole issue. The big issue is with alcohol and drugs. In 1998 I had a community meeting with Aboriginal women. They brought their children and they told me, 'We are facing sexual abuse and our kids are sniffing glue.' There was no assistance. Everyone turns their back. They don't really want to deal with the issue, because they would be called a racist. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are real problems and issues in these communities. There is escalating crime. The attitude is: 'Don't lock up Aboriginals, because the incarceration rate is getting too high.' Why is it getting that high? I have been speaking to a lot of Aboriginal communities, and it is because there is a lack of employment. Then you look at the reason that is happening. Is it because they are on alcohol and drugs and it makes them unemployable? That's another issue to look at. How are we really going to address the problem? Don't turn your back on it because you think it is too hard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cashless debit card is a start, and it is working. I have spoken to police, and they have said that, once it has been introduced, reduction in crime has started and families are buying decent food for the kids. Health issues, like diabetes and kidney dysfunction, are another big problem. This is all happening because of their diet. Isn't it best to apply, as I said, tough love? It means they can't go out and use their money to buy drugs and alcohol and end up in a dysfunctional life and a dysfunctional family. Those kids coming through become used to that life because of their parents. We need to break the cycle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sexual abuse is another thing. We heard earlier this year that a kid as young as two was raped—and just recently we heard of a seven-year-old boy. No-one wants to discuss this. Why is it happening? Again, it is because of dysfunctional communities. I'm not having a go at the Aboriginal communities. I respect their culture, but it's not working, and we have to be honest with ourselves in this place if we are to find the right answers. I don't think anyone here would have a go at any culture at all, but we have to be honest with ourselves and find the answers to try to prove it. Billions of dollars a year are thrown at it, but nothing seems to change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Families are asking for help. Let's look at the cashless debit card. The moneys are put into an account. Eighty per cent has to be spent on the card, and it stipulates that you can't go and buy alcohol with it and you can't gamble with it. Twenty per cent is still cash. They can still spend that cash where they want to. And there's another thing with the Aboriginal community, if you understand the culture, which is that if they have cash in their pockets and a family member or a friend comes to them and asks them for money they rarely will say no to that, unless they're very strong. They hand over that money. So there also could be intimidation happening in these communities. If you're going to allow these people to actually have cash in their pockets all the time, other family members will be the ones who will take the money from them. But, if they're restricted and they know they haven't got the cash, they can't hand it over, so they can provide what needs to be done for their own families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens talk about their amendments today. I can't believe their amendments. The Greens will complain and whinge all the time about different things and about people's rights. But I never hear about how they're going to deal with this. It's all right to sit back and whinge and complain about it, but, unless you've actually got the answers, how are you going to deal with this issue? Everyone wants their rights, but with rights come responsibilities. If you're going to pull back this card, where are our responsibilities? Because their parents aren't good parents and because of the drinking, the alcohol and the sexual abuse that's going on, where is our duty of care, as the managers of this country on behalf of the people, to give those young children coming through the same opportunity? We have a responsibility to ensure that the kids have at least half a chance to be looked after, educated and not sexually abused.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have been moving their amendments today. One is to abandon it completely. The other one is that they want to take away the income management of the card so you'll only be on the card if you have had a serious offence of three years or more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  All right. It is that if you have a serious offence of three years or more you're on income management. So being drunk and disorderly is no reason for it at all. When you have people who are saying that it is working in these communities, that families are now able to provide for and look after their children, that communities are better for it, that there is less violence, less drinking, less alcohol and fewer drugs, why on earth would you want to say no to it? If this is all about the politics in this place, then I say, 'Get over it.' It shouldn't be about politics. When you look at these bills you have to look at what is in the best interests of the country and the people and start working together. If you're not happy with the bill then come up with some answers; don't just say that it should be abandoned and talk about people's rights. As I said before, responsibilities and rights go hand in hand.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do support this bill. It is working. I say to anyone out there who may be listening to this: if you don't like the cashless debit card and having a responsibility to the taxpayer who is giving you this money so you that can live, put a roof over your head and survive, then my suggestion is that you get a job.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RUSTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Families and Social Services and Manager of Government Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:19</span>):  I thank all senators for their contributions to this debate on the Social Services (Administration) Amendment (Cashless Welfare) Bill 2019. The cashless debit card is an important part of our plan to improve the lives of Australians by supporting people, their families and communities in places where high levels of welfare dependency co-exist with high levels of social harm. By reducing the amount of cash available in a community, the cashless debit card is reducing the overall harm caused by welfare-fuelled alcohol, gambling, and drug misuse—and it's working.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence on the ground shows that the cashless debit card is making a real difference, improving people's lives and improving communities. Over a dozen research projects attest to the trial's success, most recently the baseline report into the Goldfields, which reaffirmed previous findings. My colleagues in this place have talked about the first impact evaluation and the findings that the cashless debit card is having a considerable positive impact in the first two trial sites. These findings included a number of significant statistical improvements in things like the reporting of less frequent drinking, the reporting of less frequent drug use, and the reporting of less frequent gambling and gambling-addicted behaviour. We have also seen decreases in drug and alcohol issues; decreases in crime, violence, and antisocial behaviour; improvements in child health and wellbeing; improvement in financial management; and the ongoing and even strengthening of community support for the card on the ground.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Results from the Australian Early Development Census show improved outcomes for children living in a cashless debit card site since the introduction of the card. From 2015 to 2018 the number of children living in Kununurra and considered really vulnerable has decreased significantly. Significant improvements were seen in social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognition, communication skills, and general knowledge. Children living in Wyndham saw a substantial improvement in emotional maturity over the same period. Our review of emergency relief food vouchers and parcels in Ceduna found that, within 18 months of being placed on the card, 16.5 per cent of cashless debit card recipients no longer needed, or needed less, assistance in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cashless debit card is not a panacea. But the evidence clearly shows that it works, and acts as a stabilising force to help people pay for essential items while preventing the excess purchase of alcohol and gambling products. Between April 2016 and July 2019, the total value of all transactions made across all sites by cashless debit card recipients using their cards was approximately $175 million. That is $175 million in taxpayer-funded welfare dollars being used on essential items and not being used on non-essential purchases, which include alcohol, drugs and gambling. Thirty-four per cent of all transactions made on the cards were to buy food. There has also been $400,000 worth of attempted but unsuccessful purchases of alcohol and gambling products, that we're aware of. The Morrison government's priority will always be to put the rights of the child first—to have a roof over their head, and food in their tummy—ahead of a welfare recipient's choice to spend taxpayer-funded welfare on drugs, alcohol or gambling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unemployment is also down in all sites since the introduction of the cashless debit card. Most recently, in Hinkler, in Queensland, the unemployment rate has dropped to 7.3 per cent, the lowest in almost seven years. Most importantly, youth unemployment has dropped from 28 per cent in May 2018 to 18.1 per cent in May 2019, a drop of almost 10 per cent in a 12-month period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Social Services (Administration) Amendment (Cashless Welfare) Bill 2019 continues the operation of the cashless debit card program but improves the processes introduced through recent non-government amendments for participants to exit the program. It provides a more effective and consistent application process, and ensures that the welfare of children, families, and the whole community is considered when assessing applications for participants to exit the program. The passage of the bill will clarify the administrative requirements of the cashless debit card exit process and ensure that the exit process is consistent with the cashless debit card regions. There is no change to the continuation of the cashless debit card program in the current trial sites. There is no change to the government's commitment to reduce the devastating effects of alcohol and drug use and gambling in these communities. The government is introducing this legislation following consultation with community leaders to ensure there is a clear and fair process for participants to exit the cashless debit card program where appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government thanks the community leaders it has worked with and will continue to work with throughout the implementation and operation of the cashless debit card program. We acknowledge their courage and their leadership to assist members of their community to break the cycle of welfare dependency, to improve social outcomes and to support people to get off welfare and the card and into employment. Taxpayers expect nothing less. The government strongly believes that providing employment is the most important thing that we can do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard from both Labor and the Greens on this bill, and I thank them for their contributions. The Greens have moved amendments to the extension process that the government unfortunately cannot support. These changes would mean that a participant charged with disorderly conduct for drunken behaviour could remain eligible for an exemption despite demonstrating the exact behaviours that the cashless debit card is aimed to address.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where Senator Siewert or other people have cases of individuals having difficulty using the card to pay their bills, I invite them to provide me with those details separately, and my office will investigate. Senator Siewert has also asked a number of questions relating to operational matters of the exit process—and I also thank Senator Siewert for the collegiate way in which she has worked with me and my office in drafting this bill. These changes are best suited to an operational guide or information sheet that will be accompanying the application form. I'll instruct my department to ensure appropriate information is contained in this documentation and provide it to the senator and anybody else. I commend this bill to the chamber.</span>

Can I ask the minister to take that on board? My understanding was that the next report from the University of Adelaide's work was due in June. I'm wondering if my understanding is correct and, if so, has that report been made available to the government yet?</span>

But, whether there were people within the cohort of people that were consulted with who were on the card who would have intended and believed they were eligible for the new exit mechanism—I am unaware of the specifics of the number of those people that were consulted with. I'm not sure if that information is available, but I will certainly try and find out.</span>

I take your point about opt-out, although I know my office was getting phone calls prior to the opt-out about how we understood the opt-out process was going to work. I presume that they were phoning the department. I'm aware there are a number of people who have been applying for the wellbeing process. That's why I asked that particular question, because I know that my office has been helping a number of them. I've got specific questions to clarify a number of things. Do we start that process now?</span>

Do you envisage that someone from DSS will help with that process over the phone, or could someone also go into the Centrelink office in, say, Kununurra to obtain support with the guide? Is that also the sort of thing you see happening?</span>

Will they have to go somewhere to get somebody to verify what they're doing for the health and safety of the person and the community?

Because, as you would understand, many of these situations are quite different to each other, we've actually taken a much more case-by-case approach on how this might be managed. I take your point. That's not the question you're asking. We will provide a guide that will outline what a normal, non-complicated process would be for the average person who would seek to come in and get the exemption. But we are also very mindful—and this is why we are particularly mindful about putting on determined time frames—that sometimes there is a level of complexity to get the information, and, because people are not able to provide the information, there is difficulty in accessing the information. Under a normal set of circumstances, the criteria and the process which the person needs to follow and the evidence that would be required for the exemption application would be clearly set out in the guidelines. Obviously, somebody will be there to help them through that. We also put on record that we understand that sometimes it's not a straightforward process, and, for those cases, we intend to put in a case-by-case process that could sit around more complicated cases.</span>

For example—and this is where I've had a little bit of experience—where someone has poor mental health and applies for a wellbeing exemption, how will that interact with the opt-out provisions where they talk about the health and safety of the person and the community? If I just apply for a wellbeing exemption, will that be considered in and of itself?</span>

I thank you for raising the question. It would be my interpretation that the wellbeing provision would be considered a higher level of exit priority simply because you're talking about somebody's personal wellbeing as opposed to, I suppose, a more straightforward financial capability exemption. You would have to prioritise somebody's health and wellbeing above financial circumstances, so I think the wellbeing one would go first.</span>

One thousand and fifty-four people have made a phone call to the relevant number seeking information or advice about the process. In terms of who will assist, it would depend on the individual as to what sorts of services they are seeking. At the moment, anybody who is currently on an Indue card, or the cashless debit card, has access within their community to locally based service providers that can assist them with any issue that they might have with their card. Those people will remain available to them to assist them in the process if they choose to seek an exemption, whether it be on the wellbeing criteria or the financial criteria. Equally, we will also make sure that assistance to exit is available by phone, and there are provisions online, to give the person who is wishing to seek the exit provision a choice in the way that they make their application.</span>

Centrecare provides all the services and resourcing to somebody who is currently on the cashless debit card in that particular trial region. These services are provided in all the sites, but I'm using that as an example, because you asked for an example. So, if the individual who is seeking a financial exemption wants one-on-one assistance in making their application, they can make an appointment, they can go into Centrecare in Kalgoorlie and they can sit down with a person in Kalgoorlie and have them assist them in filling out the form—even to the point of assistance with interpretation, for example, because obviously we want to make sure that we are assisting them in their mother language.</span>

There are approximately 12,000 participants on the card, but I can provide you with the numbers for each of the individual sites.

I'm certainly happy to take on notice to see how much more granular I can be in the information you're asking for. I'm more than happy to provide that to you, but at the moment I'm not entirely sure that I'm going to be able to provide the exact information you're asking for.</span>

But you would be able to provide figures on how many people in each location?</span>

But one of the things that I can absolutely assure you of is that the variation in the costs of assisting individuals with the card vary quite significantly.</span>

How many people have been impacted by the cashless debit card outages to date? Where have the outages occurred? What is the longest outage? How does the minister expect people to buy groceries and pay bills on time if the card is not working? How many people have missed payments or incurred overdue charges because of card outages? I ask these questions because, as you would be aware, Minister, there have been confirmed reports of card outages preventing people from shopping using their card.</span>

We wouldn't necessarily have any information that relates specifically to outages that were outside of our control. But what I will take on notice and provide you with information on is if there have been any card-specific outages—in relation to the technology or the use of the card specifically—that have prevented somebody from being able to use it in a facility where they would've expected to be able to use it. I'll get that information, and, once we've got it, we'll seek to provide the further detail in terms of the implications of those outages. But my advice is that, in the majority of times that people have been concerned about their inability to use their card, nobody would've been able to use any cards, because the outage was actually a more general community-wide outage—as I say, whether it was a power outage or a failure of an EFTPOS system.</span>

Since the re-election of the Morrison government, there are some processes that still have to be undertaken in developing the legislation to enable those people who are currently on the BasicsCard in the Northern Territory and Cape York to move over onto the cashless debit card. So, whilst the intention is quite clear, the legislative instruments to enable that to happen have not passed through this place as yet.</span>

My understanding was that the original trial sites were quite small, Ceduna being by far the smallest. The banks saw the small scale of the trial as not being something that they were necessarily particularly interested in participating in. That was the reason given to us by the banks, I understand, at the time that we sought their involvement.</span>

Does the minister think that every person on the CDC is incapable of managing their affairs? Does the community think that every trial site has adequate services, such as health, education, early intervention, drug and alcohol rehabilitation, and job creation?</span>

We worked very closely with those communities to ensure the outcomes we're seeking to achieve, which are better community outcomes, as listed. I don't need to repeat them all to you; they have previously resulted from a prevalence of drug, alcohol and gambling addiction and abuse. We work with the communities to make sure that those outcomes are appropriate and that the people are being appropriately targeted to make sure we deliver the good outcomes the community have requested by voluntary participation in this particular program.

One of the things we did do as part of the process of setting up these trials was to make additional funds available to many of these wraparound services that, in many instances, already existed within the communities. But we saw that, with the introduction of a new way of seeking to get people to manage their financial affairs and the consequences of that, additional funding was needed to assist them with those wraparound services. So the answer is yes.</span>

Minister, I'm sure that you and the department would be fully aware of that. So my question goes to the services that have been provided to trial site communities. What conversations have those communities had with either the minister or the department around issues that they have with a lack of wraparound services, wraparound services that are not adequate, or services not actually being there at all?</span>

As part of the rollout of the trial and the assessment of the outcomes that the trial is delivering, we review all services that relate to the outcome criteria we're dealing with, which you referred to, whether they be domestic violence services, police services or the like. We do that every year. Where it is identified that additional services are required, we seek to work with the state governments and other partners in these trials to make sure that the adequacy of the services is addressed.</span>

It appears from the advice that I am receiving from the agency, who are closer to the coalface on this than I am, that we receive very few complaints. But obviously when we do receive complaints they are taken seriously and are addressed—and anything will be put into part of the review if it relates specifically to the availability of the services that you're referring to.</span>

I want to go back to my line of inquiry about the criteria. I want to now go back to being able to manage your financial affairs. I wonder what specifically will be required there. Will someone with financial management qualifications be providing the advice to the secretary? I'm particularly interested in this, because what I consider good financial management by someone on a low income may in fact be very different to what someone with a lot of income can do. For example, I know from personal experience that, when living on a very low income, you sometimes don't pay a bill on time, because you can't afford it. You know you have until a certain time after the due date to pay it, so you pay another bill because this one is just becoming due and you are about to get your power turned off and then you will pay this one. You're managing your money because you have very little. People who don't understand how people on low incomes manage their money and manage to make ends meet may see that as poor financial management.</span>

I think what you raise here is the specific nature of dealing with many of these issues on a case-by-case basis. Going to the analogy you've just made: nobody's going to get a bad credit rating for paying their bills a bit late; you only get a bad credit rating if you don't pay your bills at all and you fall into default and you end up, through the process, getting put on a reach. So, I take very clearly your point on the degree to which financial management imprudence is interpreted. Looking at the holistic suite of issues, as part of this legislation we'd be seeking for someone to be able to demonstrate—I clearly take on board your point about the interpretation of financial management and the necessity for the person who's making the determination within the department to take on board the issues you raised about low-income earners and how they manage their money. So I suppose what I can say is that I believe that for this to be able to work it needs to be able to have the level of nuance that you're referring to, and case-by-case management. There will be a whole heap of people who will tick the box on every occasion, and it will be fine, but there will just need to be a level of leniency provided for the demonstration of the example you just gave.</span>

I want to go to the issue I raised around the health and community worker not having a direct professional relationship with the trial participant. How would you intend to deal with that—that is, ensure that somebody who is asking for someone's exit application to be reconsidered, for them to be put back on the card, is in a position to make an informed recommendation, through professional contacts, for that to happen? How can you guarantee that?</span>

I think we would seek to make sure here that if anybody—a community worker or a health worker—made a recommendation that somebody who had exited the card should no longer be exited, or somebody who wasn't on the card should be on the card, that that would probably trigger an investigation, but that in and of itself would not be sufficient for any action to be taken. If a health worker or a community worker made an application to the Department of Social Services to indicate that someone should be on the card then that would trigger us checking, but it would not in and of itself do that. They must only do that in their professional capacity. I understand your point about how you distinguish between professional and non-professional, but it certainly would not be in and of itself sufficient to have the person put back on the card.</span>

You built that into the process. It's a reconsideration—not automatically back on the card. My concern is for a person who has received an exemption. There's a degree of trauma going then. Somebody's now said, 'I need to go back on the card.' That person hasn't any professional relationship to me. I haven't gone to see them at the health clinic. I haven't accessed the service that they may be working in, because a community worker could be someone working in an NGO, for example. I don't have any professional relationship with them. They just rang up the department, or did whatever the process will be, and now I'm faced with proving all over again that I meet all the criteria. I really don't see how that's fair.</span>

It sounded like I was talking literally, but I was talking figuratively. But I take the point. I will now ask about the wellbeing exemptions. One of the things with the wellbeing exemptions—and I'm glad this is being tightened up—is the issue about how the serious risk is being interpreted. Will there now be some guidance for people when they're applying for the wellbeing exemption? I do appreciate there hasn't been a lot of guidance there, so it's been a bit hit and miss quite frankly. Will there be some guide to participants about what information they need to provide?</span>

As a reflection of some discussions that we've been having with you in the development of this, we quite clearly saw that a clearer set of guidelines or criteria in relation to the wellbeing exemption was needed. In reformatting this, assuming we're successful in getting these amendments through this place today, we would make sure that the same sort guidelines and clarity of what was required sat alongside the wellbeing exemption as well as the financial one.</span>

Is it going to be the usual review process under social security law?</span>

Obviously, social security law applies across anything that we do, but what we're seeking to do as part of this new process is actually to put an internal review process into the Department of Social Services to enable them to be able to deal, within the agency at a higher level than the standard determination may well be made, with any complaints or determinations that are not agreed with. This will mean that only those cases that are of a more significant nature will end up having to go to a higher authority like the AAT.</span>

Obviously, the delegated power for determinations rests with the secretary, but, realistically, the secretary is not going to be doing all the detail. So the internal review process enables the person an opportunity to have the determination reviewed by somebody much higher up in the organisation.</span>

But in terms of the specifics that you're asking for:  community leaders, community service providers, the community participants—it really is very much at the broadest possible, catch-all level in terms of the consultation that can occur. But in the specifics, as I say, it is community leaders, community elders, participants, providers, and, most importantly, current participants.</span>

Whilst we absolutely support the concept of consultation and the importance of it for this particular project, we'd probably be seeking to tailor our consultation processes so that they meet the desires of the individual community. We'd certainly be working with the community participants, the elders, suppliers, providers et cetera, to make sure that the consultation covered the broadest range of people possible but also that the process of consultation reflected what that community wanted and whether the people in that community wanted to participate in that consultation.</span>

Is it the financial counsellor? And how do I know, as a cashless debit card holder? You will send them some form of communication that says, 'You can apply to come off the card.' Will there be a list in the Goldfields region of agencies I can contact if I can't do it online?</span>

There is nobody in any of these sites that doesn't already have a place that they would know to go to if they needed to change any of their conditions or get information, have assistance provided et cetera. That already exists. But part of the guidelines associated with the two exemption categories that we are seeking to amend and have reinserted into the bill today would have all of the information sitting alongside how they should progress, if they wished to avail themselves of this particular provision. </span>

You have been very clear about saying the information would be alongside any other information they get, and I think we all accept that. My issue is, when I go into Centrecare in Kalgoorlie, I need to be assured that there is someone there able to assist me in my application if I'm not able to do that myself. I'm asking who it is in Centrecare or which department it is. Is it their financial counselling department? Is it the drug and alcohol service? Is it the domestic violence service? Which service would I be asking for when I walk into that Centrecare office in Kalgoorlie?</span>

I single out Mr Neil Oliver and Mr Richard Lewis AM for their distinguished careers as active members of our community in Western Australia, as active members of the Western Australian Liberal Party and, importantly, as significant and important parliamentarians who made a great contribution to the growth and prosperity of Western Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to begin by sharing with the Senate comments that Anthony McAdam made—Anthony McAdam being a lifelong friend of Mr Neil Oliver—and which were reported in <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> on 22 July this year. I'd like to talk about Neil Oliver's contribution, reflecting on those remarks by Mr McAdam, in three parts: the early life of Neil Oliver, the parliamentary and political life of Neil Oliver, and Neil Oliver as more than just a parliamentarian but a man committed to his community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">He was educated at Caulfield Grammar and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and was a keen sailor in his youth with the Royal Melbourne Yacht Squadron (in St Kilda).</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">He was an officer cadet in the Australian Army from 1952 to 1954, and served in the Citizens Military (now the Army Reserve) from 1954 to 1977; he was the youngest major in the army and reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">He saw active service in the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War. He ended his formal army association as honorary colonel of his regiment for more than a decade. For many years he was also vice-president of the Army Museum of WA.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Neil Oliver's parliamentary and political life is the lens through which I got to know Neil Oliver. Anthony McAdam writes:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">On the encouragement of Sir Charles Court, he successfully stood for the Legislative Council in the election of 1977 and was re-elected in the 1983 election.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">He was particularly concerned with the improprieties of the Burke government. As the chairman of the Council's select committee—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">into the Midland Brick scandal, he almost single-handedly opened up the many outrageous abuses of State power orchestrated by the Labor government, which eventually led to the collapse of Burke's government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">During this period Oliver was often in the news, not least when it was revealed that his phone had been tapped. It was a lonely fight. The full story of that dramatic parliamentary enquiry and its consequences is chronicled in the 1987 book Burke's Shambles: Parliamentary Contempt in the Wild West (authored by … the late UWA Professor of Politics, Paddy O'Brien).</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Colonel Oliver's other contributions to public life include his service as vice-president of the Multiple Sclerosis Society of WA, as a founding member of the Edith Cowan University Foundation and, for some 40 years, as a justice of the peace.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In later years he was instrumental in ensuring passage of the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement. Long interested in vibrant public debate, he arranged speaking tours for prominent thinkers in the "Putting Australia Right" movement in the 1980s and later helped organise the influential "Achievements of Democratic Capitalism" conferences in Sydney and Melbourne (with such speakers as the historian Geoffrey Blainey and the … British journalists Paul Johnson and Bernard Levin).</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">He passed away in the same nursing home, St Luke's in Shenton Park, where Joy had been resident for some months. It was fitting as they have long been an inseparable couple.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second Western Australian parliamentarian that I want to honour this afternoon is none other than Mr Richard Lewis AM, a distinguished member of the Western Australian parliament, a distinguished member of the Court government and a man whose legacy you can see around you when you travel across Perth and its various metropolitan communities. I'd like to share some comments, again reported in <span style="font-style:italic;">The West Australian</span> newspaper on 19 March this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beginning with 'Richard Lewis AM, cabinet minister and surveyor, born in East Fremantle in 1939, died in Perth aged 79', it continues:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Chopping down trees, bashing pegs into the ground, taking measurements … and then spending four-hour evenings at Perth Technical College checking calculations and measurements. Cadet cartographers/surveyors like Richard Lewis needed stamina and patience throughout a work day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">While still in his teens he embraced the world of maps, statistics, numbers, angles and distances. He could have stayed on this reasonably straightforward path, but realised that life offered more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Within months of obtaining his certificate of competency in 1969 he stood as a council candidate in Melville, entering the less measurable environment of suburban democracy. Over the next 14 years he was to serve three terms as deputy mayor, proving himself in the sometimes difficult, always changeable, field of local affairs. This proved to be the launchpad for the next level of government. In 1986 he was elected Liberal MLA for East Melville.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Richard Lewis's contribution to public life is outstanding. I came to know Richard Lewis as a minister in the Court government when I had the privilege of working with Richard Court when he was the Premier of Western Australia. Richard Lewis's legacies to Western Australia are many. He will be fondly remembered by all of those people who got to know him in his local community, who came to work with him as a minister in the Court government, who came to know him through his active involvement and regular attendance at The 500 Club events in Western Australia, and who came to know him as a generous man, a family man, a man who was committed to many things, not least his great faith in the West Coast Eagles.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Many attest to Richard's capacity to countenance views different from his. He went so far as to accept free kicks being given against his beloved West Coast Eagles, including while attending all their four victorious grand finals. Surveying profession colleagues enjoyed his company at social functions for decades.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Richard Lewis died on March 3. He is survived by Helen, their daughter Morgen, son Lachlan and three grandchildren and his three brothers, Don, Roger and Lyndon.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Fremantle Rowing Club's tableau of triumph includes a photograph of the eight that in March 1959 won the inaugural Fremantle-to-Perth race. At bow is R. Lewis. This position on boats is for the one who, rowing authorities assert, is technically correct and keeps the boat balanced.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (12<span class="HPS-Time">:55</span>):  Today I want to talk about what life is like for everyday Tasmanians. As most people know, I'm a proud and passionate Tasmanian, and it would seem I'm not alone, as our population is growing at its fastest rate in 27 years. Both the state and federal governments like to lay claim to the growth in the Tasmanian economy but have no answers when everyday Tasmanians ask when they are going to see the benefits of that growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People are moving to Tasmania but are finding it hard to get a job and, at the same time, finding it hard to afford somewhere to live. Any growth in wages is almost entirely absorbed by increases in prices, so workers are unable to get ahead. Recent ABS data has revealed that thousands of full-time jobs have disappeared from the Tasmanian economy. Today, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Advocate</span> newspaper from north-west Tasmania has the headline 'Jobs Puzzle'. It asks why Tasmania has lost thousands of jobs. It is permanent, full-time jobs that have been hit the hardest. Some 6,200 full-time jobs were lost in the 12 months from June 2018 to June 2019. The most recent CommSec <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the States</span> report also highlighted the job market as being weakest in the Tasmanian economy. In fact, Tasmania has the weakest job market of all the states. The jobless rate in Tasmania is 6.7 per cent, the highest it has been since November 2014 and the highest of any state. To that can be added the fact that, according to the ABS, underemployment in Tasmania is at 10.4 per cent. For Tasmanians lucky enough to have full-time, secure work, real wage growth is only 0.4 per cent above inflation. Hobart also had the highest annual inflation rate for the March quarter, at 2.1 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said, at the same time that the Tasmanian population is increasing, full-time jobs are vanishing, underemployment is rising, unemployment is increasing and wages are not going up. But the cost of living is going up and rent is going up. The Anglicare <span style="font-style:italic;">Rental </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Affordability Snapshot</span> illustrates a dire rental market. Of every private rental advertised in Tasmania on 24 and 25 March this year, almost all were out of reach of people on low incomes. Of the 1,245 rental properties in Tasmania, not one was affordable for a single person on Newstart. Only six per cent were affordable for a couple on Newstart with two children. None were affordable for young people on youth allowance. In southern Tasmania, none were affordable for single parents on a parenting payment. Of course, electricity is also going up. The Australian Energy Market Operator data dashboard reveals average annual wholesale prices have gone up nationally 158 per cent since 2015, skyrocketing under the coalition government on energy minister Angus Taylor's watch. In Tasmania, there has been a price hike in wholesale electricity of 142 per cent since 2015.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People are being left behind, even people who have full-time work, not just the underemployed or the unemployed. So what is the struggle like for people without a job? What is the struggle like for pensioners? Remember, the Minister for Families and Social Services, Senator Ruston, believes that the pension is 'a generous amount of money that the Australian taxpayers make available to our older Australians'. What is the struggle like for those who are homeless? Well, the Assistant Minister for Community Housing, Homelessness and Community Services, Luke Howarth, wants to 'put a positive spin' on homelessness. How can the coalition government attempt to put a positive spin on ABS figures that show that homelessness in this nation has increased by 14 per cent in the last five years? These are real issues for everyday people in what is being called a booming economy but is leaving so many people behind at every turn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How do people on Newstart survive, when the jobless rate in Tasmania is 6.7 per cent, when rent prices are out of reach for many people who do not have jobs and when the price of electricity has risen by 142 per cent since 2015 in Tasmania, all of this on the coalition government's watch? We know Newstart is too low—so low that it pushes people into poverty and prevents them from getting jobs, so low that some parents have to decide to feed their kids by not eating meals themselves, so low that every sector of society—even members of the Morrison coalition government—are calling for it to be increased. Calls to raise the Newstart allowance have come from economists, the RBA governor, the Australian business community and social service groups, including the Tasmanian Council of Social Service and the Council of the Ageing, but the government refuses to act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent Deloitte Access Economics report shows that Tasmania has the highest proportion of Newstart recipients of any state and the second-highest in the country. We have 21,300 people who are struggling to make ends meet on a payment that is inadequate. In March this year, Per Capita released research showing that 54 per cent of people living in Hobart and 70 per cent of people outside Hobart believe that Newstart should be increased. Newstart is currently just over $555 a fortnight for a single person without children, paid to people who are actively looking for work. That is just over $277 a week. The rate has not increased in real terms for more than two decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of living, not least rent and power bills, obviously has done the opposite in real terms. And according to National Seniors, older Australians aged between 55 and 64 are being pushed into poverty as they approach retirement age. This is worse for those who rent, those who do not have significant savings and those who are facing significant health costs. For those older Australians, for single-parent families and for people who cannot find work, the story is all too common. In my state of Tasmania, too many people are familiar with this struggle. It's the struggle of so many Australians to keep a roof over their heads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The failure to act on Newstart is just one in a series of attacks by this government on those in our community who can least afford it: the lack of action on access to affordable housing, the $1.6 billion underspend in the NDIS to prop up their budget—the list goes on and on.</span>

                  </a>  Yesterday, Liberal Senator Wendy Askew came into the chamber and praised former Tasmanian health minister Michael Ferguson. I don't know what prompted Senator Askew to praise Mr Ferguson, but if she really believes that the health system in Tasmania is doing well, she must be accessing a different system to the one used by everyday Tasmanians who have the misfortune of becoming sick or being in an accident. Michael Ferguson is the former state health minister—former—because he was removed, sacked from the health portfolio, in a midnight reshuffle by Premier Hodgman. He is regarded by the community and by health professionals as being deaf to calls for urgent change.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Figures recently released to the ABC show that ambulance ramping at the Royal Hobart Hospital has been a living nightmare for patients and staff. For the nine months to March, ramping of ambulances at the Royal Hobart Hospital reached just under 10,000 hours. This means hundreds of hours of paramedics' time spent waiting with patients who cannot get into the emergency department. It means taking overstretched paramedics and ambulances out of emergency circulation. There are many hospital professionals in Tasmania who have been calling for action to fix the health system in Tasmania, and this has been completely ignored by the Premier and the state Liberal government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As government underinvestment has eroded essential life-making services, like education and training in communities, the mining lobby and others have been allowed to convince workers that planet destroying jobs in extractive industries are the only option to make ends meet. Governments and corporations have tried to sell working communities the lie that green politics are incompatible with their interests. This is particularly true for communities who have been historically reliant on fossil fuel jobs. But the reality is that the fossil fuel corporations are no friends of workers. We see these corporations relentlessly pursuing automation to avoid hiring, making promises of jobs that will never materialise—as is happening with Adani—and undermining job security and the quality of life at every turn. The stranglehold that coal has had over communities in places like the Hunter in New South Wales have put them at the mercy of a small number of corporations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once coal and gas are no longer economically viable, which is already rapidly happening, enormous fossil fuel companies will pack it in and abandon workers and their communities in search of profit elsewhere. Coal communities, whether that be communities in and around coal mines or around coal-fired power stations, will be left high and dry by these coal and power companies. These companies are extractive in more than one sense of the word. They extract the wealth from communities and leave behind giant unrehabilitated holes in the earth, toxic ash dams and the legacy of respiratory disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is up to us, as we end the extraction of coal and gas in Australia, to change this reality for workers. We need massive investment in secure, sustainable and rewarding jobs in green industries. We need a national and just transition for workers and an unprecedented commitment to education and training, starting with free TAFE and uni for all. But we mustn't constrain ourselves to a narrow conception of green jobs as work in renewables or replacements for fossil fuel workers. Green jobs are those that actually enrich our lives and enrich the community. They are caring jobs in our schools, libraries, hospitals, nursing homes and community institutions. They are the jobs that that have life making and solidarity as their essential purpose—the exact kind of jobs needed to make our world a more just place for all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each step towards a post-carbon future must be taken alongside workers, the disadvantaged and all those whose livelihoods have been cheapened by the extractive hunger of rampant capitalism. The time of corporations plying politicians with donations, gala dinners and job offers to buy their continued support for rampant environmental destruction and profit making has to pass. In its place our democracy must emphasise the inclusion of community interests in decision-making. Public ownership of our key services, expanded community decision-making bodies, and greater workplace rights are all avenues to realising this. The challenge of just transitions underscores this. If it were workers calling the shots, then a meaningful transition from precarious industries like coal mining would have begun decades ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the creation of life-making jobs it's essential that we raise the overall standard of living through investment in services, arts, and our environment. It's long past time we moved the goal posts from society supplying the mere essentials—health care, education and a modicum of legal protection from capitalist employers—to a guarantee of the opportunity to live a meaningful and dignified life. This means rewriting our industrial relations laws to redress inequality and create more space and time for life. It is passing us by. It means investing in the institutions that enrich our lives from preschools and community centres to local parks, green spaces and arts initiatives. It means investing in future technologies and rebuilding our public universities to conduct the research and development needed for a fair green future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By restructuring our economy to replace profit making with life making, we make redundant the old measures of economic strength that encourage unchecked growth, exalt business confidence and fetishise surpluses. It's time we turned to measures of society that highlight the impact of the economy of people. We should look to New Zealand's recent wellbeing budget and social measures of inequality in developing new metrics of success as a society. I don't pretend that realising life-making jobs, investment in our communities and a transition to a post-carbon society doesn't demand significant investment. In fact, I welcome it and the benefits it will have. Nothing short of committing a significant portion of our economy to realising this transformation will be sufficient. With that commitment we will need new public institutions to direct this massive investment in our future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's vital we don't make the mistake of limiting economic and environmental transformation to an Australian project. These are international problems whose solutions demand international movements. We cannot have global climate justice without recognising and remediating the legacy of extractive settler colonialism that has destroyed countless lives. In Australia, that means continuing our work alongside First Nations people toward treaties and supporting them in the process of truth-telling, healing and self-determination. Internationally, the principles of a fair green future demands we look at climate reparations and commit to ending colonialism, structural inequalities and grossly unfair neoliberal trade and debt systems imposed on the global south. We must look at overseas aid as a global justice issue inextricably linked with our climate change efforts. Our investment must go beyond our borders and ensure supply chains are just and sustainable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This future cannot be won just from within parliaments and legislatures. The push is coming from the community to deliver the change we need. People are mobalising to take urgent action on the climate crisis we face. But that does not mean politicians have no role to play. To my colleagues here and in the other place, my message is clear. We are not here to swallow neoliberal economic orthodoxy and put markets and profit ahead of people. Our society can't afford us spending another three years watching political paint dry while the climate meltdown accelerates outside these walls. The government must lead in quitting coal, backing renewable energy and supporting workers who are being left in limbo by the major parties' refusal to acknowledge the inevitable decline of unsustainable fossil fuels. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor and Liberal governments have provided billions in subsidies to fossil fuel corporations, poisoning our planet. These billions must be redirected to a life-making future and matched with investment of a scale that we have never seen before. The imperative of profit making has driven our planet and society to the edge, with exploitation of the environment and workers, and it must be abandoned. We need to reconceptualise society that isn't predicated on endless unsustainable planet-killing economic growth. That's the fair green future we need.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HZE" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SESELJA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Finance, Charities and Electoral Matters</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  It's always good to rise after a Green, and I thank her for that Venezuelan inspired vision for the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to turn to more important local issues and honour some great achievers here in the ACT. It was wonderful to attend the Australian Hotels Association ACT awards night recently. I want to pay tribute to a number of the wonderful hotels that were honoured at the awards. I also want to thank Michael Capezio and Anthony Brierley, from the local AHA, who do a great job advocating for their industry. It must be said that many of the venues acknowledged at the awards will be known to many in this place and beyond. QT Canberra, in Acton, did particularly well, winning no fewer than three awards, including best food and beverage talent. Other venues recognised would be familiar with honourable senators. They include Hotel Realm and East Hotel. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Without wishing to take away from some of these outstanding venues, I'd like to take this opportunity to draw the Senate's attention to the bars, pubs and clubs that they may be less familiar with that were honoured. Relatively new, Canberra venue 88mph was recognised for its outstanding sales and marketing. I congratulate Antony Arena and all his team for their hard work. 88mpn is an eighties themed bar. And speaking as someone who spent much of his formative years in the eighties, it was a magnificent time in our nation's history and it was great to relive some of those memories. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another of Antony's venues, Molly, was recognised as Canberra's best cocktail lounge or small bar. Molly is another throwback, this time to a prohibition era speak-easy. During prohibition, speak-easies were somewhat ahead of their time. They were some of the original pop-up shops. They would frequently pop up and then vanish again, only to reappear elsewhere, always trying to stay one step ahead of law enforcement. Molly has continued this tradition—of course, not trying to avoid the law—but when their original home in Hobart Place, in the city, was knocked down, Molly disappeared for a few months. But I'm glad to say they have risen, like the phoenix, from the ashes and have reappeared bigger and better than ever. Molly is, once again, open for business. I'd encourage people to get out there and check out some of the great bars in the ACT. Without wishing to reflect on former members of the other place, specifically the former member for Darwin, the Hon. King O'Malley, I'm glad we live in more enlightened times and that his attempt to make Canberra a dry city did not last too long. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to Molly winning best cocktail lounge or small bar, Michael Nguyen from Molly was recognised as the AHA's ACT bartender of the year. This is a significant achievement and I want to congratulate Michael and wish him all the best in his future endeavours. Many of us enjoy a good beer, so it was also good to see that the Duxton in O'Connor, the Durham in Kingston and BentSpoke in Braddon were recognised for their outstanding beers. I congratulate all of the venues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I may get to a couple of the other ones that won awards, but it's worth also mentioning a Canberra institution: Mooseheads. The Mooseheads pub, which many in this place may have experienced at some point, has been a Canberra institution for many years, for as long as I can remember and beyond. Downstairs Mooseheads is a relaxing place to engage in some rapid hydration, hopefully responsibly, while surrounded by sports, military and university memorabilia. Downstairs Mooseheads has been a big part of student life at the ANU, where I was lucky enough to study, as well as for many from the Royal Military College Duntroon and countless sporting teams around our city. So I wanted to pay tribute to those who have made Mooseheads a Canberra institution, and for some of the awards that it has received.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other award winners included the new bar Kokomo's, also in the city. Best sporting entertainment venue was won by Kingston bar The Dock. The Dock is owned by a couple of our outstanding former Wallabies, Ben Alexander and Scott Fardy, who also made a great contribution to rugby here in the ACT and are now running The Dock. So congratulations to Ben and Scott and the team at The Dock.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On another issue, I was very pleased earlier last month to announce the completion of the Healthy Waterways project which confirms this government's ongoing commitment to practical environmental action and investment here in Canberra. The $93.5 million ACT Healthy Waterways project aims to improve water quality in ACT waterways as well as improve the long-term water quality downstream to the Murrumbidgee River system and the Murray-Darling Basin. This project represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to significantly improve water quality in the ACT's lakes and waterways. This program included the installation of 20 water quality improvement sites, such as ponds, rain gardens and wetlands across the ACT. When fully developed, the water quality improvement infrastructure will see a significant reduction in several key pollutants in ACT waterways and downstream into the Murray-Darling Basin. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apart from the infrastructure projects we have been able to deliver, Healthy Waterways is funding two pioneering research projects on water quality, and the H2OK community education program to stop rubbish and organic matter entering the stormwater system. This research serves to inform future research on what causes poor water quality, including where blue-green algae outbreaks come from and how they behave once they are in the lakes. This will allow researchers to determine what interventions will work best in the future. Now, I know that this is important to the health of the Murray-Darling Basin more broadly, but it's also very important locally, as our waterways, such as Lake Burley Griffin, Lake Tuggeranong and Lake Ginninderra, haven't always been in the best state. In order for them to be used for recreation, it is important that we clean up those waterways. So it's a really important contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only do these investments enlarge current understanding of ACT ecology, as mentioned earlier, but they further emphasise the government's commitment to improving community facilities for residents to use and enjoy. I know there are many residents right across Canberra who will be looking forward to the cleaner waterways which have been facilitated in part by this project. The Liberal-National government contributed the vast bulk of the funds, $85 million of the $93.5 million, towards this project. Projects such as this are of course only possible because of the strong economy and the strong budgetary situation our government presides over. We're very proud to be able to deliver these investments in our local environment here in the ACT, making a contribution to the overall health of the Murray-Darling but also, importantly, delivering better local environmental outcomes and better amenity for our waterways here in the ACT.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="204953" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLACHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:23</span>):  I'd like to address the issue of the Newstart payment, and the commentary and debate about that. I think it's fairly instructive to place on the record first up that I honestly don't know how anybody can survive on Newstart. The standing costs in my household would outstrip Newstart on a daily basis, and that's without looking at things that you eat or do, or your car or electricity costs. Clearly, there is broad consensus right across society and also in this place that the fiscal amount is inappropriate. It's also instructive to look at the comment of the Hon. Mathias Cormann that it's a 'transitional payment'. It's clear there are fewer people coming into Newstart, and there are a substantial number of people who don't stay on Newstart for 12 months or longer, but some of the underlying statistics really do need careful evaluation. The prevalence of long-term unemployment has risen from 13.4 per cent in April 2009 to 22.9 per cent in April 2019, so there are a large number of people who are on it for longer than 12 months. The proportion of Newstart recipients on payments for more than a year has climbed from 69 per cent at 2014 to 73 per cent in 2016, and, according to the department's own figures, to 76.5 per cent in 2018. So at any one time the overwhelming majority of people surviving on Newstart are doing it for more than one year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a real tragedy, because in the short time I've been in this place, both in government and outside in opposition, I've had the opportunity to visit Centrelink facilities in various parts of South Australia. I go to the social workers in those places and say, 'How is it possible that people are structurally unable to get into the workforce?' They'll point to various reasons, but the one that stuck in my mind particularly was dental. Once your teeth are not in a good shape and once you're unable to articulate and openly communicate with people at an interview or in any sort of area, you become withdrawn. They pointed very clearly to the cost of dental remediation and health as a huge impost, a huge impediment, to people actually gaining work, to going through the interview process and doing things that would get them back into the workforce. We all know that the cost of dental health is expensive. It's expensive and considered expensive by people who have full-time employment. But we don't have any ability for those people to be referred to a specialist program to get their teeth fixed so they can actually smile at an interview and articulate their case more clearly. So little areas of concern like that are completely not addressed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I stood in the Centrelink office in Port Pirie and was chatting with people coming and going. A young lad came in, clearly agitated, clearly very upset, a bit dishevelled and not on the top of his day. He was pointed to a phone, and after 30 minutes he got that phone and started banging it on the counter until someone came out and actually interacted with him as a human being. What transpired was that there had been a death in the family. He knew there was an emergency payment through the Centrelink system so he could get a bus fare to Melbourne and attend his grandfather's funeral.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people who work in this area are unbelievably under pressure and they're dealing with a completely inflexible system, which in some cases is almost inhumane in the way it treats people. It does need fixing. It doesn't need fixing just by a rubber stamp of a dollar or a dollar amount at the headline figure. It needs a fundamental root and branch review. We need to look carefully with an economic lens on what we're going to do to move these people forward, because we cannot continue to consign an enormous amount of people to an inordinately long time in a very, very punitive system of which there appears to be no way of escaping.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you are suffering from a need for psychological counselling, if you're suffering from a family breakdown, if you've got nowhere to stay so you're on the street, if you've got a pittance to survive on, you're still expected to boot and suit and go for 30 job interviews a month. This doesn't appear to be the real world. This 46th Parliament should be doing what this parliament should do properly: in a completely bipartisan way evaluate this critical area of social policy and improve it. We will never agree on all matters, but there should be enough decency in the parliament, there should be enough decency in this chamber and in the other place, that we don't politically score points on this issue. We see and walk past people in Canberra, in Melbourne, in Adelaide, who are homeless. If your income is $555 a fortnight as a single person, I don't know how you get a roof over your head. I don't know where you get a roof over your head if you're bereft of family support. When you're not able to get a charitable institution to provide you with a room or a bed or whatever, where do you get the roof over your head? We're continuing to see this in cities all around the world and all around Australia, and we should be doing something about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that the reference that has gone through this place in recent days is an inordinately well-structured piece of work. It does not go to just the adequacy of payments. We all know, politically, if there's an agreement to increase it, people will say, 'Well, that's been absorbed, and now we want more.' What are we doing about the structural reasons why people cannot get back into interacting in the workplaces, which they would benefit enormously from? And we need to look at the impact of geography, age and characteristics. I know from interactions through my office that we're increasingly seeing people who worked all their lives—in fairly low-paid occupations—who may have accumulated an injury or two along the way. For whatever reason, the business they were in has gone bankrupt or closed, and they've been placed into the jobseeker market at a mature age.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The classic example is a constituent of mine who's 63 years old. His future is Newstart until he gets an increase when he gets to the pension age. He wants to work. He carries an injury; he can't stand for long periods of time. Employers make selective decisions. That's the way the world is. If you put in for job applications and someone has an impediment that is an injury which has been compensated in the past and restricts their performance, they're not likely to be at the top of employment selection. So he's facing three or four years on Newstart, and it is debilitating. The fact that he can't do what he's always done—participate in a workforce, have friendships, have disagreements, do the normal things of life—means he then starts to get a psychological injury because all of a sudden he thinks the problem is him. We shouldn't be doing this. This is wrong. We should be immediately acting in a bipartisan way to look at a forensic deep dive into the structural causes of this and we should be trying to fix it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm instructed by my colleague Senator Dodson. He makes really insightful comments. Who are the actual beneficiaries of this institutionalised poverty? You could be cynical and say, 'Well lots of public servants work in this space managing the criteria, managing the compliance, managing the paperwork in and paperwork out and managing the stats up and stats down.' If we were to add all of those costs of the institutionalised operation of Newstart, maybe there would be some money around to be able to pay a higher dividend for those unfortunate enough to be in this situation. Some of you may know that I'm fond of the game of golf, so I do know this: Bobby Jones, the greatest amateur golfer in the world, when he was at the bottom of the deepest part of the British open, in a bunker, chipped it up four times and it came back down to the same spot; his caddie said to him, 'You know, Mr Jones, the definition of madness is to do the same thing repeatedly and expect a different result.' That's what we're doing here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been at this for a long time. The institutionalised report that we got is that there are a lot of people unable to move after 12 months. There are not enough funds going in there to sustain themselves. There is not enough effort going in there to understand and attack the issues that are causing this institutionalised, long-term poverty. We need to do something about it, and doing the same thing is not going to cut it. This parliament, the 46th Parliament, should do a real deep dive into this area and start addressing the simple and clear things which people in the sector will identify. They know what is causing people to be not able to front up to interviews, not able to complete job applications and not able to undertake the training activities. We don't need an increase of people living in poverty on the streets of this country.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LAMBIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  We've had four scandals in the first four weeks of this parliament. All of them were over ministers and ex-ministers acting—or being seen to be acting—in a way that gives inappropriate benefit to them or their mates. In every case, it's got to do with cash. And then this Crown Casino story comes along and turns up the volume to 11. You say, 'There's nothing to see here!' Just because you can't see anything wrong doesn't mean there's nothing to see. Maybe you just need your eyesight checked. Maybe you've spent too long on a minister's salary cuddling up to gaming lobbyists and executives—lobbyists like former Labor minister Stephen Conroy, who's now the head lobbyist for the gambling industry, and executives like former Liberal minister Helen Coonan, who's on the board of Crown. You spend too long drinking the free drinks of the gambling industry and, what do you know, your vision gets blurry. Maybe that is why you think there is nothing to see here when everyone else can see it a mile away. Here's the truth of it: casinos are above the law because they have money and they pay big. They have dirty, filthy money to buy rotten politicians. They are using it, and you are letting them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have allegations that foreign nationals were allowed to get off private jets coming from China. There were no checks by Border Force, no paperwork and no Customs checks—absolutely nothing. One allegation is that a wanted criminal was allowed to touchdown in Australia on his private jet, despite being subject to an Interpol notice. We have allegations that Crown was bringing in people who were being investigated or monitored by police and intelligence agencies. Australia's consular staff knew it was happening. They didn't stop it. They were actually helping it. We have allegations of money laundering going on at the Crown casino.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have allegations that two ministers pressured the Border Force chief to make it easier for Chinese gamblers to get into Australia on private jets. What is the response from this place? It's a referral to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. I guess it is just a coincidence that the commission isn't allowed to investigate ministers or former ministers. How convenient! Everyone gets investigated except for the politicians in this place. It is one rule for this place and one rule for every other Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When politicians leave the parliament, they still get a free pass to do what ever they want. Say you are Christopher Pyne and you want to go from being the Minister for Defence to the ex-minister being paid to get money from defence. That's fine! That's within the rules. Once again, there's nothing to see here! Bruce Billson took a salary from a lobby group while he was sitting in parliament. He was getting paid by the public to work for them and, at the same time, was getting paid by a bunch of companies to work for them—both at the same time. That's fine! Apparently, there is no conflict here and nothing to see! Ian Macfarlane went from being the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources—he was responsible for regulating the mining industry—to being the head of the mining lobby. You don't see a problem with that one either?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People see this for what it is: it is politicians treating public service like it is a paid internship for the job you really want when you leave. They see you trading on the professional relationships you have developed, which taxpayers paid for you to develop. You then go and sell those relationships to the highest bidder. What do we get for our investment in you? We get laws that apply to us and not to you. Remind me, how many ministers have ever breached the Statement of Ministerial Standards? We have the only rules that regulate the conduct of ex-ministers being a statement that doesn't do anything. It is like a Monty Python sketch, isn't it? The man responsible for enforcing it says that it can't be enforced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals and the Nationals say that they have to send in AFP officers to search the underwear drawers of journalists because nobody is above the law. Are you going to find out who leaked a classified ASIO and Border Force briefing back in February? There are 11 people who had a copy of it, including the minister. The AFP didn't commence any investigation into that one. Is that just a coincidence? We get companies like Crown that face allegations of being so far above the law that it's like they are a country of their own. We get this bipartisan conspiracy of silence when it comes to gambling because both sides are up to their necks in it. Money comes out of the pockets of the most poor and vulnerable via the pokies and then makes its way back to fund your re-election campaigns—charming!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmanians, remember the money being poured into the coffers of the state Liberal Party from the pokies lobby in the last election? Remember the way they spent hard and spent big to stop dead any hint of reform? The Tasmanian Liberals got over half a million dollars into their election coffers to be able to outspend everybody else. They also had two separate multimillion dollar campaigns run by the pub pokie barons and the federal group. They were campaigning alongside them with all of the money in the world and none of the responsibility. They bought an election with money coming from problem gamblers. Half of their money comes from problem gamblers. They are using that money to block anything that would ever help problem gamblers. They're abusing the most vulnerable and they're doing it in alliance with the Liberal Party. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They know that most Tasmanians want pokies gone from pubs and clubs and they know that reform was popular and necessary, so they spent big to send a message to every other state that was watching: 'What we're doing here we'll do there too. If you want to win an election again, you'll leave the gambling lobby alone—or we'll take you down.' That's exactly what happened in Tasmania. That's exactly how it played out. As a result nothing changes—all because a bunch of billionaire pokies bosses would rather hurt pensioners and single mums than their own bottom line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So they buy an election and they get to write the rules. The rules that apply to them get written by them and the rest of us just have to live with it and suck it up. Crown gets to write its own rules because it has got enough to buy them. If the rest of us have a problem with that, it's tough luck, too bad. Nobody wins when you can buy an exemption from the rule of law. We end up with a democracy that is for sale—and it is for sale. The people out there see it happening and they think it is absolutely disgusting—actually they think it's worse, but I won't use the words that they use; I won't do that in here—and I do too. They're looking at you lot in here to do something about it and they're seeing what I'm seeing—you're doing absolutely nothing and you're now buying seats. People are now living in misery for that. That is not democracy. That is not the Australian way.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  I rise today to update the Senate briefly on the current state of the live sheep export trade, which is predominantly from my home state of Western Australia. I do so to report some positive news and some disturbing revelations that have come to light in the other place. I will start with the positive news.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the resumption of the trade there have been some 714,141 sheep loaded in the Fremantle port. Sheep mortality across all those 11 voyages was 1,867—that is, a 0.26 per cent sheep mortality rate. I've said many times in this place and in many other public forums that, once the sheep export trade got underway again, it could prove that it could be done in a sustainable and humane way, and that is what the industry has proved. That mortality rate is extraordinary for 714,000 sheep. I think those of us on this side of the chamber—we who know the economic importance of the trade, the importance of protein to our markets and the serious way that farmers and exporters treat animal welfare—should be extraordinarily pleased with those numbers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday there were some revelations in the other place though from my good friend and colleague Mr Rick Wilson, the member for O'Connor, about the cash-for-cruelty scandal that is engulfing some radical activist groups, including Animals Australia. Media reports earlier this year stated the amount paid to the crew member who procured the footage that outraged so many Australians—and I absolutely acknowledge that it did outrage Australians. Media reports earlier this year claimed that some $38,000 had exchanged hands. In the other place the member for O'Connor revealed that new evidence suggests that the crew member was paid up to $175,000 to procure that footage. Absolutely damning emails between the crew member and Animals Australia have surfaced, detailing a shopping list of footage that they were willing to pay for. One email included 'key instructions' for filming:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A payment of up to $175,000 is an extraordinary revelation, and I absolutely backup the call from my good friend and colleague from Western Australia Senator Smith, who brought this matter to the attention of the ACNC earlier this year. This is something that requires urgent investigation. It is not acceptable behaviour from an organisation with tax-deductible status to offer these kinds of sums in exchange for footage. It is an absolute disgrace to the organisation and a blot—a stain—on the charitable status of other organisations as well. It's something that must be addressed urgently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind the chamber of the importance of this industry to my home state of Western Australia. Live sheep exports are worth around $1.5 billion to the Western Australian economy. There are around 5½ thousand sheep-producing businesses in Western Australia. More than 100 countries around the world export livestock. We are the only country that regulates specific animal welfare outcomes. As I have said a number of times, in this place and in many other forums, we do not only export sheep, we export animal welfare. The interconnection between the export trade and the domestic trade is vital, and important to the ongoing capacity of the Western Australian farming community to produce the high-quality lamb and mutton and wool that this nation loves so much. Western Australia's sheep flock is around 14.6 million, which is up 2.6 per cent year on year. Now that's not surprising, because the sheep industry is undergoing somewhat of a renaissance. Following the collapse of the Wool Reserve Price Scheme, the industry underwent a long period of extraordinarily difficult structural adjustment. For the last six to eight years it's been on a very solid upward trajectory. I notice Senator Reynolds has entered the chamber, and, as a proud Western Australian, I'm sure she would support me in this. The upturn in the sheep industry in Western Australia has resulted in much more income, wealth and activity in those small regional communities that we love so much.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a trade that is sustainable. It can be done in a well-regulated manner, as we have seen from the 11 ships that have departed Fremantle since November last year. We still have some challenges ahead. The industry understands that, and the industry is committed both to openness and to continuous improvement. Currently, we're on a three-month voluntary suspension—that is, a three-month voluntary moratorium—for the Northern Hemisphere summer. That was something that those on this side supported and that the industry actually brought forward. We are looking forward to seeing the trade start up again on 1 September this year. I understand the regulator is going to hand down a decision on that today—hopefully I haven't missed that announcement while I've been speaking, and hopefully it will align with 1 September. I'm certainly hopeful that that date of 1 September does see the resumption of the trade once more.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my final few moments I wish to emphasise once again that a sum of $175,000 to collect footage—a laundry list of cruelty where the crew member has actually offered to disable ventilation fans on board—is an extraordinary accusation against an organisation in Australia with charitable status. I call on the ACNC to examine this matter thoroughly but in the most expeditious manner possible, because I do not think that that is something the Australian people would accept.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="121628" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  The recent attacks on the superannuation system by the Liberal Party reveal the true face of the government when it comes to supporting workers in retirement. Under Mr Abbott, the Liberals delayed increases to the superannuation guarantee, and last week members of the government lined up one after the other to suggest further delays to the increase in super for working people. Mr Kelly floated the idea of opening up super for housing deposits before stating that he didn't think voters would see it as a broken promise if the government were to delay the super guarantee's rise to 12 per cent. Senator Paterson said that he recognised it's no good putting more money into super if that system is broken. Mr Wilson suggested weakening the superannuation guarantee by making future increases voluntary. And in his first speech to the Senate here in this place Senator Bragg revealed the true agenda when he suggested that, for some, superannuation be abolished altogether.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is hard not to see this as an absolutely coordinated attack by Liberal Party backbenchers on the superannuation system. The Liberal Party, at its core, is opposed to compulsory superannuation. It's actually quite puzzling, because our super system is the envy of many other comparable countries. It's puzzling because super is consistent with Liberal ideals around saving and it's puzzling because superannuation eases pressure on the age pension. But the hostility to this system demonstrates just how out of touch the government are with ordinary Australians, because their approach to superannuation would see low-income workers worse off in retirement, and the majority of those low-income workers are women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Compulsory superannuation offers a chance for all working Australians to have a dignified retirement and access to a pool of savings that was once only afforded to very wealthy people, who were mostly men. For women, superannuation should provide the opportunity to achieve economic security in retirement. The reality is that the balances for women at retirement are still far from adequate, and government policy settings are a big part of this. More than half of working women do not receive any of the $30 billion in superannuation tax concessions each year. The pay gap for men and women has been stuck at around 18 per cent for nearly two decades, and the government have no plans to address this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, even in this context, the government backbenchers are now out advocating for a policy that will make things so much worse for working women. Increasing the rate of superannuation from 9.5 per cent to 12 per cent is critical to providing economic security for women in retirement. Abandoning it will significantly undermine the ability for many women to have any chance of a comfortable retirement. Modelling from Women in Super shows that today's average 30-year-old woman receiving 9.5 per cent across her working life will fall short of a comfortable retirement, and that's the prognosis for a woman who retires with no debt, with good health and with limited expenses. Astonishingly, Women in Super's analysis suggests that only 2½ per cent of women currently between 30 and 40 years of age will reach a comfortable retirement standard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further modelling shows that a 25-year-old woman earning $35,000 a year could lose 15 per cent from her retirement balance if the current timetable to reach 12 per cent is abandoned. That is over $41,000 in today's dollars, and if that woman takes time out to care for children and works part time over nine years, she will lose a further $35,000 of her retirement balance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For women who work for less than average wages the prospect in retirement is significantly grimmer. And it's borne out in the stats because 40 per cent of older single retired women currently experience economic insecurity in retirement, and they are the fastest group experiencing homelessness. Without an increase to 12 per cent future generations of women could face a similar situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The comments from members of this government advocating a delay, or abandoning the increase to 12 per cent, demonstrate just how indifferent they are to the plight of today's women. It makes you wonder if any of them have ever actually met a low-income woman.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should not expect women to go it alone. Women expect better from people on the government benches. This isn't just an issue for women who are retiring in the coming years; it's an issue for women who are entering the workforce for their first day on the job today. Government attitudes towards superannuation for women need to change fast or we will condemn the current generation to poverty in retirement.</span>

I want to acknowledge that many people did a lot of work to help the Liberal National Party achieve 23 out of 30 seats and also return three senators.

We have the wonderful Angie Bell, who is delivering her maiden speech this afternoon in the other chamber. We have Terry Young, the member for Longman. We all remember what happened in Longman in terms of the by-election that, when you think about it, led to the re-election of the Morrison government on 18 May.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Terry Young gave his maiden speech about two hours ago in the other chamber. He is a small business person who grew up in and understands the suburbs of Caboolture, Morayfield and Bribie Island.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course we had Brad Carswell in Lilley. 'Send a worker to Canberra' was possibly the best slogan to come out of a campaign in the last 20 or 30 years. Brad Carswell is someone who has the callouses on his hands. His Labor opponent is one of those other Labor lawyers who comes from that university of Labor 'dulldom'.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have got Angela Owen, a Brisbane city councillor, who ran for us in Moreton. Those who know AO, Angela, know that she is a force of nature, someone who is absolutely brilliant. She understands the ethnic communities of Brisbane better than anyone else in Brisbane.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have Clinton Pattison, who would make a far better shadow Treasurer or Treasurer than the current member for Rankin will ever make, because he understands the importance of lower taxes. He understands the importance of a strong economy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator CORMANN:</span>
                  </a>  I thank the Senate. Allegations in the media today reporting on comments by former parliamentary staff members on bullying, harassment and assault are deeply concerning and distressing. Electorate and personal staff are employed by their senator or member under legislation that allows employees who face workplace bullying and sexual harassment to have their claims heard confidentially and investigated thoroughly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where an incident occurs, staff or an employer can contact the Department of Finance to seek advice, request counselling, lodge a complaint, request a formal investigation or seek advice on a workers' compensation claim. If a complaint of bullying or harassment is made by a former employee, they can still contact the Department of Finance, and relevant policies continue to apply to the extent possible. My department would register the complaint confidentially and follow normal processes to advise a relevant member or senator about the complaint, with the consent of the complainant. This allows the parliamentarian to address any concerns about remaining risks in their workplace or consider other appropriate action that could and should be taken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where an employee believes they have been subject to a criminal assault, these matters should be referred to the police for investigation. Employees in this circumstance can continue to access support and counselling through the Employee Assistance Program if the matter has been referred to police.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no place for any form of bullying, intimidation or sexual harassment in any workplace, and the Australian parliament is no different. That is why we have strict protocols to eliminate or minimise the risk of such acts. All members and senators should ensure their staff are aware of these policies and the opportunities that are available to them to have any issues addressed. The government encourages staff of any member or senator from any party to make use of these policies and services and assures them that their confidentiality and privacy will be respected at all times.</span>

As Senator Green would be aware, when the devastating floods hit Queensland in February this year the Department of Human Services put a postcode pause on debt recovery in the areas that were identified by those postcodes in recognition of the hardship that had occurred and would continue to occur to those people in that area. I can categorically state, as I stand here today, that the pause that was placed on those postcode areas in the Townsville area post the floods remains in place.</span>

In February, there was a pause placed on income compliance debt recovery. As we stand here today, that debt recovery pause remains in place. I have only just received this letter. I am more than happy to have a look at this letter and see what is actually in it. I have not had the privilege to do that as yet. Once I have had the opportunity to review what's in this letter, I will come back to this place and I will advise you of my response to it. But, as I said to you on several occasions in this chamber—and I'm glad that you've eventually provided a letter, which I now have the opportunity to review—I was always prepared, if you ever had an example or evidence of debt recovery that had recommenced in the Townsville area in relation to income compliance debt recovery, to address it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:10</span>):  I thank the senator for the question. As I was saying yesterday, the government has put in place the right economic framework so that businesses can prosper, grow and create more jobs for Australians. We're also a government that knows and unashamedly believes that the best form of welfare is a job. We are committed to getting Australians who are on welfare off welfare and into a job. In fact, under this government, welfare dependency in Australia is the lowest it has been in 30 years. This is because, as a government, we know you have to have in place the right policies and the right programs to assist people who are on welfare and want to get a job. Mr President, jobactive is the Australian government's way to get more Australians into work by connecting those who are looking for work, the jobseeker, with employers out there who are looking for employees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to advise the Senate that since July 2015 it has achieved 1.39 million job placements. Indeed, it continues to achieve around 1,000 job placements every single day. What providers on the network can also do is connect jobseekers with a range of government services and government initiatives. This includes: relocation assistance—if somebody wanted to go to the great state of Queensland and work, they could get relocation assistance—employer wage subsidies and training apprenticeships. And, if you want to start your own business, we have a fantastic program that has been going now for in excess of three decades, known as the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme. If you're a young person aged under 25, our Youth Jobs PaTH program can help you get the skills and experience you need to secure a job. The best form of welfare is a job, and we've got in place the programs and procedures.</span>

The government is committed to mutual obligation. Mutual obligation requirements are designed to ensure that unemployed people who are receiving welfare payments are actively looking for work and participating in activities that will actually help them get into employment. This is all about getting people off welfare and getting them into work. It is a fundamental tenet, mutual obligation, of our jobactive system. It ensures that those who are receiving welfare payments and assistance from the Australian taxpayer are taking the necessary steps they need to take to get a job. Mutual obligation includes activities such as job searches, job interviews and, of course, meetings with the jobactive provider. It can be difficult for some Australians to do this, and that is why those experiencing greater difficulty under the jobactive system are given greater assistance.</span>

On this side of the chamber, as this government, we understand the benefit of work. When a person gets a job it gives so many personal benefits to the individual. It gives them their self-esteem, which comes from the dignity of work. I have met with so many people in this role and in my previous role who tell me: 'Michaelia, it gave me a reason to get up in the morning. By getting that job, I now get out of bed every single day.' They have pride when they're able to provide for their family. You can never underestimate the pride that a person gets in being able to provide for their family because they have found work. But also, the parents tell me: 'I can now provide for my future generation. When my kids look at me, they see I've got a job, and that's a good thing.'</span>

But I would point out to those in this chamber that as the minister responsible for social services and as the minister responsible for the welfare system in Australia, I have an obligation to make sure that we have a sustainable welfare system into the future, and that's exactly what I'm doing. </span>

But, more broadly, I would say to you that the Australian social welfare system is designed to provide people with what they are entitled to.

So, I think this information is directly relevant.</span>

My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. Australians are increasingly concerned about the revelations surrounding Crown casino and its relationship with authorities. If dodgy visa access, drug trafficking, money laundering, and prostitution aren't enough, reports yesterday about a Victorian property known as a 'dude ranch' are simply bizarre. The dude ranch, known to the Victorian police and the local council, is where high rollers visiting Crown allegedly 'gun up' and kill wombats from the windows of their luxury limousines. Minister, what is your government doing to investigate and speak with the Victorian police about this alleged illegal activity?</span>

The first point I would make is a point that I made earlier in the week, and that is that the Australian government takes allegations of illegal activity very seriously. Everyone, of course, is required to abide by the Australian law, which includes casino operators, public officials and visitors to our country. You would also be aware that our law enforcement agencies are working hard to disrupt and deter criminal groups by collecting evidence and intelligence about financially motivated crime. It is not something that is done by government at the political level. It is something that is done, appropriately, independently by our law enforcement agencies, and it wouldn't be appropriate for me to provide specific details, given the potential to compromise ongoing investigations.</span>

The referral relates to media reports involving various allegations of corruption with respect to interactions between employees of Crown casino and others. All these allegations have now been referred to ACLEI. It would not be appropriate for me to comment further.</span>

                  </a>  Obviously, I'm not aware of the facts in relation to this at all. Law enforcement investigations are not political exercises. Law enforcement investigations are, appropriately, handled independently by those agencies. I've already referred the Senate to the referral by the Attorney-General on 30 July 2019 of various matters related to this to ACLEI. In relation to the question which is, I guess, implied in Senator Hanson-Young's comment, whether ACLEI can investigate ministers: ACLEI is responsible for the investigation of corruption issues in designated Australian government law enforcement agencies. If ACLEI discovers information relating to issues outside its jurisdiction, ACLEI may share that information with an appropriate state or territory police force for further action. ACLEI may also share the information with the relevant ombudsman or other integrity agency.</span>

But in this country, appropriately, law enforcement investigations are not conducted as political exercises. I don't think that the Australian people would be well served by political exercises along the lines that are implied in the question. The senator also clearly did not listen to my previous answer where I pointed out that, if ACLEI discovers information relating to issues outside its jurisdiction, ACLEI may share that information with appropriate Commonwealth, state or territory police forces for further action. ACLEI may also share the information with a relevant ombudsman or other integrity agency.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Families and Social Services and Manager of Government Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:25</span>):  I'd like to thank Senator O'Sullivan for his question and for his obvious and significant interest in rural and remote communities in Australia. The Morrison government understands the importance of education and the ability for children all over Australia to have access to the resources that they need for their education. I'm delighted to be able to announce that the Morrison government will introduce a bill today to boost support to more than 2,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families with children who need to live away from home to access secondary education. Through these changes, the delivery of an additional $36.4 million in support over the next four years—which means approximately $5,900 per year for these students and the costs associated with them going to boarding school—will be extended to these families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will extend the family tax benefit part B to eligible secondary students aged 16 who receive ABSTUDY assistance to study away from home. This is a very significant investment, one of which this government is very proud. Amendments introduced by this bill will also build on the measure of 50 years of ABSTUDY. This includes better, fairer and more flexible travel provisions and the portability of ABSTUDY benefits if students change schools. Many remote Indigenous communities have no secondary school, so boarding school is often the only opportunity that they have if their students wish to complete their high school. The financial cost of going to boarding school can be extremely high, and this provides a disincentive for families to continue to send their children to school. It is particularly a disincentive to attaining year 12 qualifications. This is putting at risk the performance of students and their completion of year 12. We know that children who complete year 12 are in a much better position to transition to work in adulthood and be contributing members of their society. Ensuring that FTB is extended to cover any costs associated with boarding relieves financial pressures.</span>

This bill helps achieve exactly that. It increases the support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families with children who need to live away from home to attend senior secondary school. The priority investment approach modelling of my department suggests that an increase in support for younger Indigenous Australians to complete year 12 will lead to long-term benefits for everyone. Those children who achieve year 12 are more likely to be in work and less likely to rely on welfare. On average, within five years of leaving school, Indigenous young people who study year 11 as boarding students are projected to have income support costs that are 38 per cent lower than those of their peers who leave school earlier. This modelling shows that these students do better in the longer term as well.</span>

We can be trusted to make sure that we deliver on Indigenous disadvantage, which this bill is evidence of. We're also very committed to ensuring that the next phase of Closing the Gap is developed as a genuine partnership between all governments and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people. We're committed to finalising the Closing the Gap framework and its targets through this partnership. This partnership agreement recognises that, in order to effect real change, governments must work collaboratively and in genuine, formal relationships with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island peoples, as they are the essential agents of change. On 12 December last year, COAG agreed to form a genuine, formal partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to finalise Closing the Gap refreshment.</span>

I'll take on notice the actual specifics, for the Minister for Government Services, in relation to the recovering of debt that is the overpayment of taxpayers' funds to Australians. I would also say to this chamber that in many instances the first thing that happens, when it comes to income compliance review—I hope you understand that. When you end up with a situation where we seek from somebody who is a recipient of a taxpayer funded payment to them, if there is a discrepancy that is identified between the records that we hold at the Department of Human Services and the records at the ATO and at the end of a period when we assess that, we will seek a discrepancy clarification—</span>

                  </a>  Thank you very much. I can confirm that the online compliance initiative does not go back past seven years. But in response to the question from Senator Smith, as I was saying, when a discrepancy has been identified between the information that an individual or a family has provided to the Department of Human Services and the ATO, we seek clarification from the individual as to whether there is a reason why that discrepancy exists. We do not raise a debt unless it has been formally identified in that process that the person has actually incurred a debt or has received moneys to which they weren't entitled. The very reason that we do this is the social welfare system in Australia is based on its sustainability, into the future, and that means that we make sure that people get what they are entitled to receive.</span>

Going back to my explanation of the process whereby we reconcile discrepancies that are identified with overpayments or potential overpayments, and where the individual has been contacted to explain why the overpayment has been made, if it is identified through that process that the person either does not have the debt—and this process, by the way, I point out, is a human-led review process. If it is identified the person does not have a debt, for reasonable reasons, then that person is not pursued. But we have an obligation, where overpayments occur, to sustain our social welfare system, to make sure that we provide people with the amount of money that they are entitled to receive. That is the basis of the sustainability of our system.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Northern Australia and Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:34</span>):  I thank Senator McMahon for her question and recognise her strong passion to see the north developed, and to do that we need better roads in the Northern Territory. That is why the federal government is investing $1.6 billion upgrading roads in the Northern Territory. It will improve mobility, it will improve access to tourism in the Northern Territory and it will improve business with lower costs and by helping attract investment and more economic opportunity into the Territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, the Territory is an area of large distances, not just within the Territory itself but also between it and other parts of the economic activity of this nation. That means that, say, the livestock industry in the Territory often faces costs of more than a third of its final value of its product taken up in transport costs. So the more we can lower those costs for the industry the more opportunities that industry will have to attract investment and jobs in the Northern Territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we're taking action on specific projects like the Tanami Road, which is between Alice Springs and Halls Creek in northern Western Australia. It was described once on <span style="font-style:italic;">Radio National Breakfast</span> as the worst highway in Australia. It is in need of massive investment. This government is taking action. After decades of talk, finally we're acting to see investment in that. The CSIRO has estimated for us that upgrading or sealing parts of that road could save up to nearly $8 a head for livestock producers in that region. It will be a great benefit to the mining industry as well, who go through trucks like no tomorrow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are upgrading the Outback Way—a different road. The Outback Way will be sealed progressively over the next decade across our continent, making it only the third sealed route from eastern Australia to Western Australia in our nation's history. Finally, it will go right through Alice Springs and will make Alice the true centre of our nation, with a sealed highway to match with significant investment in the north. There are a variety of other roads we're investing in to help industry and to help the Territory get ahead, and that's why we are investing in northern Australia.</span>

We've done significant investments and deals with other larger cities around Australia, but it's great that we are also focusing on areas like the Barkly region and Tennant Creek to make sure they get sufficient focus from our nation's government. We are investing, or have already committed, $45 million in that community in a variety of projects. A very exciting one we did was to get radar services properly established there. During the floods in north-west Queensland we saw how important radar was in those parts of the world. Senator McDonald knows that well. We're investing $16 million to increase housing supply and reduce overcrowding. We also have various investments in mediation services for youth and for reactivating sporting leagues and creating a business hub in the Barkly region to help the Territory get ahead.</span>

Last year, we had the CSIRO look at a variety of catchments across northern Australia, one of which was the Darwin catchment. It's got enormous potential. Some of our best scientists from the CSIRO looked at this and identified a range of off-stream storages on the Mary and Adelaide rivers that could be built in the Darwin region. The CEO of Northern Territory Farmers, Greg Owens, said about this work, 'It is a very comprehensive and detailed report which provides the information that our growers need to make decisions in northern Australia.' We are following up on that report. A few months ago I was with Senator McMahon in Darwin announcing further funding for the Adelaide River Offstream Water Storage project. It could create up to 1,400 jobs and increase farming activity in Darwin and the Northern Territory.</span>

During the health policy election debate, Minister Hunt referred to a decision by the United States Food and Drug Administration to authorise a smoke-free nicotine-delivery product on the basis that it was appropriate for the protection of public health as a public health disaster. Commissioner Gottlieb of the FDA referred to the need to redouble efforts to protect kids from all nicotine-containing products but also said:</span>

Senator Bernardi, as you would be aware, in relation to e-cigarettes the Australian government is taking a precautionary approach. As you would also be aware, presently nicotine for use in e-cigarettes cannot be lawfully sold in Australia. The government will continue to monitor evidence about the safety of e-cigarettes, their impact on smoking initiation and cessation, uptake amongst youth and dual use with conventional tobacco products.</span>

You would also be aware that the government has also commissioned the National Centre for Epidemiology &amp; Population Health at the Australian National University to conduct a public health assessment of e-cigarette use. This assessment was designed by the centre and it will be independent. It will provide further evidence to support high-quality decision-making on e-cigarettes for the Australian context.</span>

The project will include consideration of the health impact of e-cigarettes on specific population subgroups, including current smokers, former smokers and people who have never regularly smoked tobacco, and different age groups, including youth and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. I'm instructed that the project is expected to be completed by December 2020.</span>

US Congressman Matt Gaetz is attending the first Australian event of the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, in Sydney next week. Mr Gaetz is best known for inviting Holocaust-denier Charles C Johnson to the State of the Union address. Mr Johnson is a man who asked for help 'taking out' a black-lives-matter activist and denied that over six million Jewish people were murdered in the Holocaust. Does the Prime Minister support members of his party room attending CPAC?</span>

The issue fundamentally that you raise is very serious. I think it is well understood that the coalition has a strong and proud track record of being a supporter of Israel, so I would reject any implication in that question that we are anything other than that. Beyond that, in order to deal with the question that Senator Wong has raised with the appropriate level of sensitivity and accuracy, I will take it on notice.</span>

This includes coordinating support across a number of areas, including safety, security, taxation, immigration, Customs, intellectual property rights and, of course, event promotion. The coalition has this week thrown our support behind the event by providing $5 million in funding to Tourism Australia in the 2019-20 budget to market the event specifically in India, Australia's fastest growing tourism market.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this week, the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and I had the pleasure of meeting with Australian cricketers to make this announcement. We met with Billy Stanlake and Kristen Beams here in Canberra. We discussed the importance of promoting the event on an international scale and ensuring that Australian sport remains a world leader, which we are recognised as being, in hosting major international sporting events. It has been fantastic to see the Australian women's cricket team and their dominance in the recent Ashes competition. I congratulate them on their success and trust that will continue into the final game tonight. I certainly hope that that success rubs off on the men's team, who commence their Ashes campaign tomorrow night.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our funding will be used to drive visitation to both the men's and women's tournaments next year. The women's tournament is starting next year. I certainly hope that we can meet the aspiration of hosting the world's largest ever crowd to a women's sporting event on International Women's Day at the MCG for the final next year.</span>

Consistent with the aims of Sports Diplomacy 2030, hosting the ICC T20 World Cup will strengthen Australia's sport and provide a platform to leverage sport to maximise trade, tourism and investment opportunities. Outside of the ICC T20 World Cup, we're investing up to $10 million to bring the Olympics back to Australia by supporting the bid for South-East Queensland for the 2032 Olympics. We are also backing Football Federation Australia's bid for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, and wouldn't it be so cool to see them playing on Australian soil?</span>

I refer to the CPAC conference to be held in Australia next week, which will feature many right-wing extremists, including failed UKIP leadership candidate Raheem Kassam, who has campaigned against Muslim immigration, labelled the Koran fundamentally evil and attacked the BBC for 'trannie pushing'. Also joining Mr Kassam is guest speaker Senator Stoker. Does the minister believe it is appropriate for Senator Stoker to attend the event alongside Mr Kassam?</span>

What I would say is that all non-citizens entering Australia must meet and continue to meet the character requirements set out in the Migration Act 1958. There are strong provisions under the act to refuse or cancel a visa where a person is found not to be of good character. Any application lodged with the department about visitors who may hold controversial views will be considered, balancing any risk they may pose with Australia's well-established freedom of speech and freedom of beliefs. All visitors to Australia are expected to obey Australian laws and satisfy the character requirements of the Migration Act, but I do make the point again that, consistent with the appropriate practices of governments of both political persuasions, we do not comment on individual cases.</span>

I can say to people in this chamber that I am absolutely privileged to be part of a government that is committed to delivering for Australia the National Broadband Network. Unlike those who made a complete hash of it, we are actually delivering it. As we all know, the NBN is the largest—</span>

                  </a>  Just wait and listen, because these are the facts here. You might not want to hear them, but these are the facts. The NBN is the largest infrastructure project ever undertaken in this country and remains on track to be completed by the mid-2020s. And our work rate just keeps on improving. The NBN is now available to more than 10 million Australian homes and businesses. This is an exciting and highly significant milestone in the rollout of NBN's fast and affordable internet for all Australians. It represents great news for all Australians who can now access this high-speed broadband and for those who will be next.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this month, NBN Co connected more than 1,000 premises to the network every single hour. That's something that those opposite could not even have dreamed of delivering—1,000 premises per working hour. This rollout was so badly managed under Labor that contractors actually downed tools and stopped construction in four states. The NBN's outstanding current rate of connection builds on the timely and efficient rollout of the network in 2018 and 2019, during which the NBN connected just under three million premises in just 12 months. This government's investment in NBN has dramatically changed the communications landscape in Australia, with 5.6 million homes and businesses now connected. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The NBN is now available to more than 10 million homes and businesses. It now has 5.6 million active connections. Our NBN is connecting more users every two weeks than Labor connected in six years. We are connecting more every fortnight than Labor did in six years. Over 60,000 premises per fortnight are being connected, compared to 51,000 under the entire six years of the Labor government—51,000 premises in six years, and 60,000 premises every two weeks under us. Soon all Australians will be able to connect. We are rolling out a multi-technology mix, just like the United States, the UK, Germany, France and many other countries.</span>

                  </a>  by those opposite in this chamber. It was an approach that was a complete and abject failure. Under Labor, the NBN was a complete and unmitigated disaster. After six years of Labor—I'll say it again—51,000 users were connected to the NBN in six years. That amounts to two per cent of premises in six years. Labor's failed fibre-to-the-premises NBN policy would have cost $30 billion and taken six to eight years longer to deliver. This would have increased broadband bills by up to $43 a month, or $500 per year, per household. Labor paid $6 billion for the NBN to pass just three per cent of Australian houses. Now, under us, more than 10 million homes and businesses are available to be connected.</span>

In 2012-13, 1,473 workers came to Australia in the first full year of the Seasonal Worker Program. The 2017-18 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook projected that 1,900 workers would come to Australia under the Pacific Labour Scheme in 2018-19. How many workers have come to Australia under the Pacific Labour Scheme since it commenced on 1 July 2018?</span>

I have folders full of answers, but I don't have one on that in particular, so I'll take it on notice. Actually, I've just been passed those papers, so in fact I will now answer the question for Senator Chisholm—just in time! In relation to the Pacific labour mobility scheme, claims that the PLS is not meeting the targets are simply wrong. The PLS never had a target of 2,000 places in year 1; 2,000 was originally the maximum cap on the number of places. The cap was removed as part of our Pacific step-up initiatives. The PLS is demand-driven and it fills positions when Australians cannot be found.</span>

                  </a>  I think I was being extremely relevant, because I was talking about the numbers and I was only 30 seconds into the answer. If I continue—and I thank Senator Wong for her extreme courtesy in this case—in relation to the numbers, Australia remains firmly committed to the growth of the Seasonal Worker Program and the new Pacific Labour Scheme. Experience from the Seasonal Worker Program indicates strong growth over time. Now in its 11th year, with over 12,000 workers in 2018-19, the program granted 56 visas in the first pilot year. Ten countries are now participating in both the Seasonal Worker Program and the Pacific Labour Scheme. There are workers from Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. The program has achieved an average annual growth rate of over 40 per cent since 2012. The Pacific Labour Scheme has processed and approved 50 employers in the first year of operation. So that program has 50 employers in two years of operation, following a four-year pilot.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These questions related to the extraordinary decision by Senator Amanda Stoker and Mr Craig Kelly MP to attend a Conservative Political Action Conference. In the wake of horrifying and tragic events and in the wake of inflammatory and divisive comments by a former senator, we have had in this place in recent time a substantial debate about the importance of all of us uniting to overcome hate, fear and division, and I remember the contributions from the other side. I remember how much discussion we had about the need to be far more careful—you should be listening to this, Senator Stoker—and far more vigilant about the hate speech proliferating in our discourse and the people with whom you choose to break bread and the people with whom you choose to share a stage.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WONG:</span>
                  </a>  I'll take that interjection, even though you're not in your chair; you're crouching on the floor and you shouldn't be interjecting from there. I'm very happy to take it from over there. The Australian parliament passed laws requiring social media companies to act upon instructions from police and other authorities to remove material inciting violent hatred, and Mr Morrison, our Prime Minister, made much fanfare for doing something that we do acknowledge was an appropriate thing to do, which was a statement at the G20 pressuring social media companies to act immediately, when contacted by authorities, to remove terrorist content such as a live video of an attack or other violent posts that seek to spread terror or recruit followers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are all fine words, but it's time for the Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, to show he's for real. It's time that he showed some leadership, because here in Australia we have a real-life conference which is a veritable academy for those wishing to learn the dark arts of hate speech. Some of the most extremist elements from the US and the UK are here running workshops on how to recruit people into the ideologies of hate. This requires a response from Mr Morrison, because if it's important enough to act decisively on hate speech in the virtual world of social media, it's certainly important enough to act decisively on hate speech in real life; otherwise it will be clear that Mr Morrison's concern for maintaining a peaceful, cohesive Australia risks being far more virtual than real.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now some might dismiss the conference—I heard some such interjections during question time—as being harmless. This one is not. This is the place where movements start. This is the place where networks are built. And this is the place where Senator Amanda Stoker and Mr Craig Kelly, and potentially others who might not be listed, will be sharing the stage with the people who have the views that were quoted in question time today—views that the Leader of the Government in the Senate described as abhorrent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is much to love about America, but there are many things we don't want to replicate here. The white supremacist movement is gaining momentum. Conflict over race and religion is increasing. We have seen more and more attacks on Jewish, Islamic and black Baptist places of worship, along with neo-Nazi rallies that have turned deadly. As I referenced in my question, one of the speakers at the Australian conference of CPAC next week is US congressman Matt Gaetz, best known for inviting Holocaust denier Charles C Johnson to the State of the Union. Mr Johnson is a man who asked for help in taking out—'taking out'—a black civil rights advocate and who denied that over six million Jewish people were murdered in the Holocaust. There is an argument to make that he ought not be allowed into Australia, on character grounds. But there should be no argument that the Prime Minister should call out this extremism as he said he would. And there shouldn't be an argument as to whether the Prime Minister must ensure that nobody from his party attend or be associated with this workshop, which is about spreading extremism in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a proud, decent, multicultural nation. As I said when we moved on a bipartisan basis to censure Fraser Anning, that multiculturalism and that tolerance and that respect has been built by both sides of parliament. That means that those people in the coalition who know that this sort of activity and these sorts of views are abhorrent should ensure that their colleagues do not engage in this conference with people who peddle such hatred and whose views are so contrary to all of Australia. This Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, said he would call out extremism wherever it was. He gave very clear commitments to the Australian people about his support for multiculturalism, respect and acceptance. Well, it's time he showed it by making sure that his people don't turn up to this conference. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I imagine that you, along with all your colleagues, have over the years attended many national conferences of the Labor Party that were attended by people such as John Setka. Am I to hold you personally responsible for all the offensive things John Setka has said over the years?

                  </a>  Thank you, Madam Deputy President. I would be sensitive too if I had a decades-long personal and political association with characters as unsavoury as John Setka. Those opposite should be ashamed of their long association with someone of such poor character, and it reflects very poorly on them that it has taken them as long as it has to denounce him. But if it's good enough for them to level these accusations against coalition senators, then they should accept the exact same standard for themselves. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  Talk about intellectually weak arguments! We heard Senator Paterson first of all assert one thing and then undercut his own logic with the second assertion. It doesn't even bear reflecting upon. All I am calling for is the same consistency that this Liberal-National government has applied in the past to people like Gavin McInnes, who founded the alt-right group Proud Boys. In November last year, he was denied a visa by this government so that he could not come here and speak, because he is a racist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government denied Holocaust denier and conspiracy theorist David Icke a visa in February this year. Here we go: Holocaust deniers and racists denied visas by this government. In all his love of free speech and all this quoting of Senator Stoker that it's okay, we just have to talk to racists and we can make it work out all right and that we shouldn't be denying racists, we should be talking to them more, Senator Paterson completely ignores that it is his government, a Liberal-National government, that denied visas to people like this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're talking about Milo Yiannopoulos, who, in March 2019, was denied a visa by this Liberal-National government—your government, Senator Paterson; your government, Senator Cormann. They denied Yiannopoulos a visa. Why? It's because he called Islam a 'barbaric' and 'alien' religion. He did it in the wake of the Christchurch massacre. Is that why they denied the visa—just because it was in the wake of the massacre? Or does this Liberal-National government actually uphold the multicultural, multireligious values that have made Australia great? This is why we have this section in the Migration Act; this is why we have this discretion for the minister for immigration: to ensure that people who are going to come to this country and incite discord and possibly violent reaction in the community are able to be barred. Senator Paterson would have us believe that we should just let anyone in. We don't. His government has barred people like Gavin McInnes, David Icke and Milo Yiannopoulos, yet there is someone as reprehensible as Raheem Kassam because, oops, Senator Stoker accepted a speaking invitation, and she wouldn't want to be embarrassed twice, because earlier this year she had to pull out of a conference because of the people she was going to be sharing the stage with.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After I made my speech last night, I wrote to the Minister for Home Affairs, Peter Dutton, and the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, David Coleman, asking them to deny Raheem Kassam a visa, as they have done with Gavin McInnes, as they have done with David Icke, as they have done with Mino Yiannopoulos. These letters were hand-delivered to the respective offices at 10 am this morning. This afternoon, I saw a headline on the <span style="font-style:italic;">The A</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ustralian</span> home page that said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are comments that, today, Minister Cormann has described as reprehensible and abhorrent. The government, however, so far seems to be quite happy for someone like this to come to Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Stoker told <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> that she's proud to be speaking at the CPAC event. I cannot believe that someone like Senator Stoker—or Mr Kelly or anyone in the Liberal-National government—is comfortable sharing a stage with someone like Mr Kassam, who describes Islam as 'fundamentally evil'. It's not all that different, in fact, to what Milo Yiannopoulos said when he described Islam as a 'barbaric' and 'alien' religion. And, frankly, his comments about Nicola Sturgeon and his implications about the role of women in public life—fundamentally the view of women that he portrays—are bile; they are being spewed. Raheem Kassam has also said that Islam is a 'fascistic and totalitarian ideology'. So my question to the government is: how is Raheem Kassam any different to Milo Yiannopoulos? How is he any different to the man you had already issued a visa to and banned? And why won't you review the decision of Minister Coleman to allow him into the country? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="N26" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ABETZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:23</span>):  The issues the Australian people are concerned about include jobs, the cost of living and the future for their children. These are the issues that engage the minds and concerns of the Australian people. But here today we have the alternative government, yet again devoid of any policy platform, seeking to pick on individual new senators. Last week, it was about two sentences out of Senator Bragg's first speech that the Labor Party sought to take note of as the big issue of the day. Today, it is relative newcomer, Senator Amanda Stoker, for going to a conference, as though that should excite the interest of the national parliament. And just in case those listening are wondering about this conference, a person who was described by John Howard as the most decent man he had ever come across in politics, former Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, will be attending that conference. Just keep that in mind. And the person Senator Wong and Senator Keneally went to the barricades on to try to make sure that he became Prime Minister, Mark Latham—thankfully they failed—is also appearing at this conference. That's the former Labor leader, as indeed is Warren Mundine, a former national president of the ALP.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I am starting to take the side of Senator Wong and Senator Keneally and ask Senator Stoker what on earth she is doing rubbing shoulders with these former Labor people! But the reality is, as Senator James Paterson has indicated, that this is an issue not about with whom one shares a stage but about what one personally believes. Good heavens above I've even appeared on <span style="font-style:italic;">The Drum</span>! I've even had GetUp! people in my office! But, I can tell you, I didn't agree with GetUp! and didn't agree with all the panellists who were interjecting on me because I was, as is always the wont on <span style="font-style:italic;">The Drum</span>, the lone voice. I even appear on <span style="font-style:italic;">Q&amp;A </span>from time to time! Does that mean I agree with the views and values expressed by other people on the panel? Of course not. That is where the intellectual bankruptcy to which my good friend and colleague Senator James Paterson referred is so absolutely rife in this debate. Indeed, other people who will be appearing at this conference include Nick Cater, from the Menzies Research Centre, Jacinta Price, a well-known Indigenous councillor and advocate, Janet Albrechtsen—and the list goes on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's be very clear here: the Labor Party's affected outrage today is because they have no policy issues to talk about. In their eagerness to try to find something to talk about today, they overlook the fact that in their own midst they have the John Setkas, they have the Luke Colliers. One former Labor senator in this place spent over 60 questions trying to defend the indefensible, and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard </span>records—I won't go through all the antecedents of one Mr Collier or indeed Mr Setka and the misogynist, ugly things they said to female enforcement officers in the workplace. There is deathly silence from the Labor Party, especially from the leader and deputy leader of the Labor Party in this place—not a word of criticism. Are they willing to condemn that sort of behaviour? Of course they're not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr President, as you resume the chair, I indicate for anybody who might have listened in to the speeches of the Labor Party's leader and deputy leader in this place that their contributions were laced with hypocrisy, duplicity and a standard they would never apply to themselves. Why do they do it? It is because they are devoid of policies and have no platform on which to engage the Australian people, so they engage in this politics of personality, rather than politics of policy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="SR5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DODSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:29</span>):  This could be a pantomime. This is a serious matter for the integrity of Australia. I stand in support of my colleagues Senator Wong and Senator Keneally in expressing concern about this conference, CPAC, the Conservative Political Action Conference, and about the standards that our leaders, particularly the Prime Minister, need to make clear when it comes to the participation of leaders from this place and other places. In the US, CPAC is an annual political conference attended by conservative activists and elected officials from across the United States. CPAC is hosted by the American Conservative Union. Now we have CPAC down under, with a conference in Sydney from 9 to 11 August.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's this about? Is this a sign that our fierce Australian characteristics of independent thinking are finally capitulating to rejected offerings from overseas? There was a time when we were concerned about how our national discourse was informed. Now it looks like we're submitting to poisonous ideas without reflection. You can buy a Reagan VIP Freedom Pass to the conference for $599. No-one from Newstart will be there; that's more than their fortnightly allowance. The one-line blurb promoting CPAC in Sydney bills the conference as a chance to 'learn', 'have fun' and 'protect the future'. Learn—what are they going to learn? What do those attending hope to learn from right-wing proselytisers from other hemispheres? Why should our political discourse be polluted by imported poisons and propaganda? Fun—locked up in a conference room with a clique of visiting right-wing nutters who shouldn't be allowed in the country. Protect the future—God save us, if all of those that are in this bunch see themselves as our protectors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr President, I invite you to go to the CPAC website and take a look at the line-up of visiting speakers. Some of them shouldn't be allowed in this country. They obviously have not come by boat! That should not be the reason for them being banned from coming here—they are more likely to fit into an 'intellectual terrorist' category than that of a tourist. Their demagoguery is a danger to democracy. Australia is so intent on protecting its borders from refugees, but how about protecting our borders from prejudiced zealots and intellectual terrorists? Why do we need to hear the US congressman with a questionable record, Trumpified and infecting Australian politics? And what's there to learn about right-wing Americans? Or why do we need to hear from someone who is promoted as a 'British political activist'—someone who is really a racist bigot? Don't we have enough homegrown fascists and fanatics? We already have too much homegrown bigotry and racism in our country. CPAC has taken to social media to defend their invitation to this man. Apparently CPAC is proud to have him at the Sydney conference, arguing that free speech is at stake here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like both of my colleagues, I am a strong defender of free speech, but, like my colleagues, I reject any right to hate speech. We already have enough homegrown bigots and racists in Australia. Extremism should not be allowed into our country. And if CPAC sees itself as the exemplar of Australian conservatism, look out everyone. It's time for the Prime Minister to act on this matter, as it is a threat to our nation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to a question without notice asked by Senator Hanson-Young today relating to ministerial conduct.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These answers related to the—it seems—forever-evolving scandal and bizarre behaviour coming out of Crown Casino and its relationships with various arms of authority. What we've heard already is that we have high rollers coming in, fast-tracked through the visa process. You pick up a prostitute on the way, you go to the Casino, you have access to as many different drugs as you want, and now, if you pay extra, you get to go to a luxury hunting lodge in country Victoria to shoot wombats—to shoot wombats! This is beyond bizarre. This is stranger than fiction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why on earth is this government doing absolutely nothing to really crack down on this hideous and obscene behaviour? Does the government really think that it is appropriate to fast-track Chinese gambling billionaires through our border protection processes so that they can come to Australia and shoot our wildlife—to come to Australia to shoot wombats? No-one in their right mind would say this is appropriate. So what are you going to do about it? We have heard that there's been an inquiry set-up that will cover some aspects of this, but is it going to protect the wombats? Is it going to look at the illegal activity at this luxury shooting and hunting lodge? No, it is not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the locals in this area are particularly worried, because the owner, Tom Zhou, is, of course, a partner of Crown. He is a Chinese billionaire and he is facilitating Chinese nationals to come into Australia to not just have a good old time at Crown but then go out to the countryside, gun up and start shooting our wildlife. It is simply not appropriate. This is a fellow who has already been pinged for being pretty damn dodgy. He is a fugitive. He has a red notice on INTERPOL. He has been known to behave in pretty inappropriate ways. There is absolutely no reason why this fellow should be given an expansion of this property in Victoria or, indeed, for these activities to continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to be clear, the reports of these allegations say you don't even have to be a good shooter on this property. It says from the website:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When we come to Australia, we should experience life that we can't experience in China. The first thing that should be felt in Australia is to be a wilderness hunter in the mountains of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That means shooting our wonderful wildlife—like wombats, incidentally. It says, 'With professional guidance, you will be a great shooter.' They are effectively guaranteeing that you can knock off one of our furry friends. This is just obscene. It is weirder and weirder, and it is about time this government did something about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's one thing to have a cosy relationship that allows your rich mates to dodge the visa process, but it's another thing to fast-track them through the border gates, get them in a limousine where they can ride around in country Victoria and gun up and shoot our wildlife. It is not on. It needs to be investigated and it should be stopped.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is this government going to do to protect our wildlife from these trigger-happy thugs? What are you going to do about it? I don't want to hear another excuse for some closed shop inquiry where it is all hands off from the ministers. Why is it that the inquiry that has been set up won't look at the association's activities or decisions of any ministers, current or former? It is absolutely within your control to make sure this is cleaned up, and cleaned up properly. But maybe it's because the government is more interested in running a protection racket for their mates at Crown. Is that what it is?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the opposition doing? They have mates at Crown too. Is that why they won't agree to an inquiry to ensure that we can get to the bottom of this? It is not just a protection racket for the ministers currently; it's a protection racket for both sides of politics. It stinks. Protect the wombats, get these thugs out of our country and clean up your act.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A suitably empowered Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports will provide an additional, independent layer of accountability and assurance over the regulation of Australia's livestock exports. The Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports Bill 2019 will provide greater assurance in the regulation of live animal exports and broader animal welfare issues. It will do this by providing the Inspector-General with the necessary independence from government and the powers to deliver a robust accountability and assurance function. An Inspector-General will promote continual improvements in the regulatory practice, performance and culture of the Department of Agriculture in its role as the regulator of Australia's livestock exports. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The measures in this Bill will enable the Inspector-General to review the administration of provisions relating to the export of livestock under the current regulatory framework. The regulatory framework is established by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Export Control Act 1982 </span>and the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997</span>. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The measures in the Bill will enable the Inspector-General to oversee the Department of Agriculture in its role as the regulator of livestock exports. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By its nature, export of livestock presents a high risk to animal health and welfare. There have been failures to comply with animal welfare standards and concerns over the regulatory response. Australians were appalled in 2018 when they saw footage of sheep dying on voyages to the Middle East on the MV Awassi Express in 2017. Many were further angered by their assessment that the mortality incident reports did not match the footage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The department's focus on trade facilitation means that it is balancing competing factors in its role as the regulator of live animal exports. Establishing an Inspector-General is part of a broader strategy to develop and maintain an effective regulatory culture. A culture that will deliver animal welfare outcomes consistent with the Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock and the best available science. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In April 2018, governance expert Mr Philip Moss AM, was asked to conduct a <span style="font-style:italic;">Review of the Regulatory Capability and Culture of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources in the Regulation of Live Animal Exports</span>. The government accepted all recommendations from this review when it was delivered in October 2018. Mr Moss recommended that an independent external entity, known as the Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports, oversee the department in its role as the regulator of livestock exports. The independent oversight and evaluation provided by a statutory office is necessary to provide a further layer of assurance over Australia's livestock export management system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In response to the Moss Review the department has formed an Animal Welfare Branch, appointed a Principal Regulatory Officer and is busy implementing the balance of the recommendations. The Animal Welfare Branch is driving a greater focus on animal welfare, including animal welfare indicators that are based on science and focused on the wellbeing of the animals, rather than mortality. The Principal Regulatory Officer is driving a culture of greater professionalism, improved cohesion and a contemporary regulatory approach as a priority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In March this year the department appointed an interim Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports, to begin the important work we expect the statutory Inspector-General to undertake. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will enable the Minister for Agriculture to appoint the Inspector-General, make other arrangements in relation to this appointment and to terminate an appointment if necessary. It will also provide the minister with the power to make rules that set out detailed requirements relating to the role of the Inspector-General and the conduct of reviews. The Bill will empower the Inspector-General to review the performance and functions, or exercise of powers, by officials under the Export Control Act and the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act. In addition the Bill will compel a person to answer questions, and give information or documents to the Inspector-General where the Inspector-General has reasonable grounds for making the request. A civil penalty may apply where a person fails to comply. The Bill will establish the basis for other matters such as information sharing, reporting and protection from civil liability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Livestock exports are a legitimate business option for our farmers and were worth over $1.7 billion in 2017-18. The livelihoods of farmers and regional businesses across Australia, thousands of jobs, depend on the livestock trade. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These are real people with real bills to pay. Any decisions regarding livestock exports must not be taken lightly–rather, decisions must be based on science and evidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The calls to ban livestock exports disregard the value of this trade to our farmers and others in rural and regional Australia. Banning, or even suspending, livestock exports would simply be a 'knee-jerk' reaction, and would be a poorly considered decision. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's amazing how quickly we have forgotten the 2011 suspension of the live cattle trade to Indonesia and its impacts on farming families. These impacts were felt through the whole supply chain and included businesses that provide transport, mustering, feed and agistment services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Following the revelation in April 2018 of conditions on the voyage of the Awassi Express to the Middle East in the 2017 northern summer, the government moved quickly to make changes to improve the welfare of our exported livestock. Independent observers were immediately placed on vessels carrying our livestock to the Middle East and information on what they found is now being published on the department's website. There was an increased focus on heat stress management. This included requiring more space for sheep travelling to the Middle East during the northern summer and independent audits of pen air turnover by qualified personnel. These changes align with the recommendations from the McCarthy Review of sheep exports to the Middle East during the northern summer, all of which the government accepted. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The review of the Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock is being undertaken in two parts: the final report on the sea transport component was released in March 2019 and recommendations from that tranche of work are being progressively implemented. A review air transport element is underway by an independent Technical Advisory Committee and it is anticipated that its report will be finalised in August 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A review of the Heat Stress Risk Assessment model was undertaken by a Technical Reference Panel and completed in May 2019. The department will be consulting stakeholders on options for implementing the recommendations from that review. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Each of these measures is critical and we will do what is necessary to support our farmers and others involved in the trade and maintain our reputation as a world leader in good animal welfare practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is another important part of the government's plan to address animal welfare concerns with livestock exports. We need to ensure that there are appropriate arrangements to oversee the Department of Agriculture in its role as regulator of livestock exports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government supports the farmers who rely on livestock exports, and the exporters who do the right thing. The government is also committed to providing the standards of animal welfare Australians expect. We need this trade to be conducted properly and sustainably. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our farmers, the Australian community more broadly, and our trading partners should have confidence in the livestock export industry. This Bill is a step in rebuilding that confidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</span>

                  </a>  The government shares the concerns about patient and staff safety in hospitals. All patients and staff have a fundamental right to feel safe when in a hospital. This motion effectively asks the government to condone industrial action where medical staff will be on strike. This will potentially put patients' lives at risk. As such, the government cannot support this motion, and we are surprised that other elected representatives would choose to support action of this nature. The government supports the appointment of Peter Anderson by the New South Wales government, who is currently undertaking a review into the safety of New South Wales hospitals.</span>

                    </a>  Seismic testing in Australian waters has been undertaken safely for decades. There are strict safety and environmental standards overseen by an independent expert regulator, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority. NOPSEMA takes account of publicly available research findings in its decisions. A large body of international and Australian scientific research shows that, when properly managed, seismic surveys can be conducted safely. A three-year research program is currently underway by the Australian Institute of Marine Science to further understand the impacts on fish, invertebrates and plankton. To provide additional assurance, an independent audit of NOPSEMA processes for proposed exploration in the Great Australian Bight is being undertaken by the Chief Scientist, Dr Alan Finkel, and he will report by the end of August.</span>

                    </a>  Labor will take a considered, consultative and pro-science approach to environmental matters. If the Greens really cared about this issue they would properly consult stakeholders, Labor and the environmental groups. They would test terms of reference to ensure that they adequately encapsulate the issues and have the potential to achieve an actual outcome for the environment and the sectors involved. Additionally, the Australian Institute of Marine Science is already conducting a three-year research program on this issue. Labor believes in taking a measured and consultative approach on these issues, engaging the sector on their concerns and allowing science to guide the decisions.</span>

                    </a>  On 30 July 2019, the Attorney-General referred this matter to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, ACLEI. ACLEI is a more appropriate body than a Senate committee to consider these allegations as its investigatory powers and resources are considerably higher than those of a parliamentary committee. It would be detrimental to have parallel ACLEI and parliamentary inquiries running at the same time as it is likely that significant legal issues and risks could arise for any witnesses called before both hearings.</span>

                    </a>  This is just an old story, and the media are trying to get some traction and make some money off it. Gamblers can come in, clearing legally imposed hurdles along the way, and the Greens complain. Yet refugees can come in here with various criminal records and enter based on a doctor's advice. This is ridiculous.</span>

                    </a>  Centre Alliance will be supporting this motion. I'd just draw people's attention to the fact that there have been allegations made in relation to ministers and members of parliament, and the jurisdiction of the act under which ACLEI conduct their investigations does not allow them to investigate those sorts of issues. So, in voting against this motion—again, it's a statement of fact that there are allegations—you are effectively removing the opportunity to investigate these serious allegations.</span>

                  </a>  The coal industry is far from unviable. Coal continues to be the mainstay of many regional economies and a major driver of exports and the Australian economy. Companies are continuing to invest in new coal projects, and coal was the largest total export earner in 2018, valued at $67 billion. The International Energy Agency's <span style="font-style:italic;">World </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Energy Outlook </span><span style="font-style:italic;">2018 </span>predicts that global coal demand will grow out to 2040 by 1.6 per cent and that Australia will have a growing share of that trade. The coal industry employed 53,300 Australians in 2017-18 and pays more than $5 billion annually in royalties.</span>

                  </a>  Companies are withdrawing because of aggressive campaigns to smear and vilify investors that are based on lies—lies about the future prospects of the coal industry and about the future prospects of the intermittent industry, otherwise known as renewables. We also notice that subsidies are distorting the market and destroying the market for coal. We also know that operating rules supporting intermittents unfairly weigh the game to the intermittents' energy. This is just the Greens' standard modus operandi for destroying a very healthy and essential industry.</span>

Since then over 25,000 parents commenced education, 15,200 parents commenced employment and over 1,300 parents exited due to stable employment.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  This motion is focused on the complete furphy that the government still runs about Newstart and Youth Allowance, which is that they are transition payments and that people go on them and off them and then move into work. I wish life were, in fact, like that, like it was previously when people could easily find work and were only on unemployment benefits for a relatively short period of time—perhaps a matter of weeks; up to six weeks. That simply is not the fact in 2019. In fact, it wasn't the fact in 2012 or in the mid-noughties when the value of Newstart started decreasing compared to payments like the age pension and when people started getting stuck on Newstart for longer and longer and longer. Let's look at how long people stay on it. The latest information from the Department of Social Services shows that people spend, on average, 156 weeks on Newstart. That's right: three years. Some people are stuck on it for a lot longer, and I'll go into that detail very shortly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clearly not a transition payment. It is clear that people are living in poverty when they're living on Newstart. The data shows us that, out of the 722,923 recipients of Newstart, 128,139 people were on Newstart for one to two years; 200,196 people were on Newstart for two to five years; 125,408 were on Newstart for between five and 10 years; and 27,765 people were on Newstart for over 10 years. It is very clear that Newstart is no longer a transition payment. For thousands of Australians, being on Newstart and youth allowance is, unfortunately, a lasting reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If only the argument that people should get a job were true. The latest statistics said there were only 159,000 jobs available, compared to 722,923 people who are looking for work. There is clearly a great imbalance between the number of people looking for work and the actual number of jobs available. When you look at the evidence, you can see that poverty in and of itself is, in fact, a barrier to finding a job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our employment services are failing to assist people adequately. It's costing us, as was mentioned by the government yesterday, nearly $7 billion. Those services are not doing the job properly. That was also established through the jobactive inquiry that reported late last year. It showed that the jobactive services were not doing the job, that people are only getting parts of those services, that they're not getting adequate support and that they're not getting support that meets their needs. Thanks to the changes in the eligibility process, many of the people who are on Newstart have a partial disability. Through welfare to work, people were transferred off the disability support pension onto Newstart. Those people with the partial capacity to work (a) are not getting properly supported through the jobactive system and (b) are also getting stuck on Newstart for a long time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Newstart can't be a transition payment when there aren't enough jobs. Many people are therefore condemned to long-term unemployment. Data released by Minister Cash shows that nearly four in five jobactive participants have had their payments suspended in the last 12 months. So people are not only on particularly poor payments but also now more at risk of losing those payments by having them suspended through the new targeted compliance program or, in fact, having them cancelled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anybody who thinks that people are living on Newstart is so sadly out of touch with reality, because trying to live on just over $277 a week is no picnic—believe me. Last night I read out the accounts of people stuck on the cashless debit card. On Monday night, I read out into the chamber the experiences that people had sent to me about life on Newstart. There was a gentleman, aged 59, living with his two dogs in a tent because that's all he could afford. The latest Anglicare survey of housing affordability showed no affordable housing—none!—in any of our major cities around this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can the government please stop running the argument that this is a transition payment and that people just want to be stuck on Newstart. They don't. I've never heard from one person on Newstart who thinks it's fantastic to be stuck on Newstart and they really want to stay there. What I have heard from people is that they are struggling to make ends meet, even to be able to buy second-hand clothes in order to be able to dress appropriately—for example, for an interview—and to be able to feed their kids.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest data, just the other day, from ACOSS showed that many people are skipping food, skipping meals, and that parents in particular do that in order to feed their children, as, of course, you would. If you are low on resources and you have a choice between feeding your children and feeding yourself, of course you are going to feed your children—although children are also going without. I've had people send me accounts of their experiences, telling me about how they didn't send their child to school that day because they couldn't send them with lunch. People also send me accounts of how bad they feel when their child can't go to a birthday party because they can't afford a present for their child to take to the birthday party. And they don't have birthday parties for their children, because they simply can't afford it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, the latest Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey, commonly called the HILDA Survey, was released. The survey found that the proportion of people living below the poverty line increased from 9.6 per cent to 10.4 per cent in 2017. The poverty line in Australia is around $460 a week for a single person with no children. But Newstart is just $277.85 a week, which falls far—significantly so—below the poverty line. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the minute and a half before I finish speaking, I'd also like to remind people that Newstart has not been increased—a real increase—for 25 years. It has simply not kept up properly with the cost of living—particularly the cost of living when you are on a low income—and the goods that you need to buy. If we look at the replacement rate as an unemployment payment, Newstart is the second-lowest unemployment payment in the OECD. The government also runs the argument, 'Oh, it's not so bad, because you get extra supplements.' I really hope that the people who are on Newstart who get an extra 65c a day under the energy supplement, which is the majority of the supplement that they receive, spend their 65c wisely! I don't think that even buys you a stamp in this country anymore. As for the people who receive rent assistance—the majority of people on Newstart don't get rent assistance—remember that statistic I gave you about the lack of affordable housing? The money they get for rent assistance goes nowhere near what you need to find an affordable property and a place to live. Newstart is too low. It is a barrier to employment. It is unfair that this country is not raising Newstart. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:53</span>):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance. The theme is that 'Newstart is no longer a transition payment' and so forth. But my first question, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President Brown, is: when did the Greens give up on the idea that people should have a job? When did they say: 'It's too hard to find jobs for young people, people in remote communities and older people. So, instead of doing what we must to help you find a job, let's just bump up Newstart and you can stay on benefits indefinitely? And we, the Greens, will no longer have to worry about our job-destroying impact on the Australian economy and, in particular, the Queensland economy.' When did they decide it was no longer worth fighting for more jobs? </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was so interested in this that I did a little bit of googling, as people do. I was trying to find out if the Greens have ever had a single policy that encouraged job creation. Well, yes, they do. They've got a policy about jobs. It may not be about job creation, but it is a policy about jobs, and it is this: to stop using coal for energy and to stop digging it out of the ground and to end all of the jobs associated with it.</span>

                  </a>  But their jobs policy is to just end all jobs arising for the mining sector, and what a jobs policy that would be. They're also happy with massively subsidising—of course, using taxpayers' money—everything to do with renewable energy, except, of course, wind farms, which they are no longer into; they've had a bit of a rethink on whether or not that's something they still value. Never mind that the long and the short of the Greens policy is the end of jobs for most Australians, and never mind that they have walked away from wind power and their enthusiasm for it, because it's pretty ugly and they're concerned it's a threat to birdlife. Maybe they're not so keen on renewables after all and so their only policy is a shutdown.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, even if the Greens have given up on jobs, we have not. The Prime Minister has said—and I agree—that the very best form of welfare is a job. And that's not just because it provides a person with an income, although that is really important. It provides the individual with the dignity of self-sufficiency. It gives a person somewhere to go, a chance to do something—purpose and accomplishment. It gives them an ambition to achieve, to do their very best, and that's why I'm so very pleased to share some of the many things that the government is doing to ensure that everybody who wants a job can get one.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's start with school leavers. The Transition to Work support program is a great place to start. It supports people who are aged 15 to 21 to help them to enter the workforce or finish their education. They often receive pre-employment support to improve their work readiness, and that can include apprenticeships and traineeships or further education. The Youth Jobs PaTH 'Prepare, Trial, Hire'  program helps employers to find and recruit the young person that's right for their business.</span>

                  </a>  Employers can receive a wage subsidy of up to $10,000, as a part of this scheme, to incentivise them to give people who need a go that very first chance. Youth Jobs PaTH also prepares young people who are aged 15 to 24 with the right skills—the soft skills that are really important to getting a go at work. They can sometimes be simple but important things, like learning how to present yourself right, how to communicate properly in the workplace and how to work as a team. We can't always take for granted that those are things that people will come to adulthood knowing, and it's great that there are ways to make sure people have the skills they need to be work ready. And, recognising that there are some places where there are far too few jobs—for example, in outback Queensland, where the youth unemployment rate is about 24 per cent—there is relocation assistance of about $9,000 to help people to move to where the work is. While I don't want to see people leave our regions, it is wonderful that there is facilitation of work for those who really want and need it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that Work for the Dole isn't a favourite of the senators opposite, but it has a real purpose. All skills are good skills, and things like being on time, learning to work with other people and some job experience, even if it's not necessarily a person's first preference, are meaningful and can give the experience and confidence needed to be able to apply for a job and to offer oneself as a valuable employee to others.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are the Harvest Labour Services and the National Harvest Labour Information Service to help connect workers with employers in harvesting areas across Australia. For years fruitgrowers have bemoaned the lack of workers and they've relied on backpackers to help in the picking seasons. But these are jobs that Australians could be doing. Indeed, when I talk to farmers across this country, they would love to be able to hire young Australians to take on these jobs. It would be a wonderful thing if more Australians were willing to come out to the regions and get into this important work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The good thing about these schemes is that access isn't limited to people who are receiving income support payments, although it is wonderful that it is also available to them. The seasonal work incentives trial offers financial incentives to encourage jobseekers to take up short-term seasonal work opportunities in the horticultural industry by providing them with an opportunity to earn more income without necessarily affecting their income support payment.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this month, the additional identified skills shortage payment became available to eligible apprentices, and their employers, commencing in 10 occupations that are currently experiencing national skill shortages. This will help apprentices to get equipped for work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other hot point we face in employment is older workers. It's a little bit sad, really, because these people have so much input and guidance they're able to share with others. I really have valued the input and guidance I have received from other older workers throughout my career. They are the ones who often have the corporate knowledge and the 'been there, done that, got the T-shirt' kind of attitude that can be of so much help to younger people in the workplace. They've often made the mistakes and they know how to go about avoiding making them again in the future. It's often wise advice to take.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Employers who don't hire a person due to their age are, in my opinion, missing out on some of the best workers there are in the market. You can teach anyone computer skills, but you just can't substitute experience. That's why we created the Restart wage subsidy, an incentive of up to $10,000 to employ eligible jobseekers who are over the age of 50. Then there's the Career Transition Assistance Program for people who are aged 45-plus. This is help for older people who still want to work to get their computer skills up to speed and to help them with their resumes and with applying for jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are wage subsidies to help encourage employers to hire eligible participants in ongoing jobs by contributing to the initial cost of hiring a new employee. Wage subsidies can help to build a business and give employers great flexibility in their hiring options.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Up to $10,000 is available for new employees who are aged between 15 and 24 years who are Indigenous or who are over the age of 50. And up to $6,500 is available for new employees who are aged 25 to 29 who are parents or who have been registered with an employment services provider for over 12 months.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can see I have not given up on jobs, even if some in the Greens have. The coalition has created 1.3 million jobs in the private sector since coming to office in 2013 and it will not back off in creating more. Australia's welfare system is comprehensive and targeted. Newstart, as tough as it is, is a safety net. The government doesn't pay the welfare bill; the taxpayer does. But we are always on the side of Australian jobseekers.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <a href="168275" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHELDON</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:03</span>):  I acknowledge the traditional owners of this place and pay my respects to elders past, present and emerging. I'm so proud to be in the Ngunawal country in the parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, a house for all people. And I pledge to progress the agenda of the Uluru Statement from the Heart to recognise First Nations people in our Constitution.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I start by thanking those responsible for me being here—first and foremost, my family. My compassionate and progressive parents, Neil and Gwen—they were both born in marriages of mixed religion in the 1920s, quite the scandal of the day. They later raised my brothers and sisters in the Catholic faith, as I raised my own children, Liam and Lily, who are here today. All four generations have interpreted religion in their own way and have their own relationship with faith, both religious and not. But our guiding principle was perhaps best expressed by the American Protestant, Charles Monroe Sheldon—would you believe, a great-great uncle of mine. In the book <span style="font-style:italic;">In His Steps,</span> one of the most read books about faith in human history, he asked and answered the question: what would Jesus do? It's a simple question to get us all, regardless of our beliefs, thinking about the ethical and moral implications of what we do in life and the consequences of those actions. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I reference this book because my parents shared this philosophy. They lived a life of service. They did this whilst raising six children, any of whom, not doubt—of course, not me!—caused them to question their faith from time to time. Dad was an industrial chemist, born in Lewisham, and mum was a nurse, born in Mudgee and trained at Bathurst Hospital. They were committed Labor people and fierce anticommunists, or 'groupers', as anticommunists were called at that time. Yet they believed so deeply in democracy that they campaigned in the 1950s against outlawing the very communism they despised. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1972, Dad was asked by Senator Arthur Gietzelt, the legendary Labor Minister for Veterans' Affairs, to run as a Labor candidate for Cook, the seat now held by the Prime Minister. They are both Sharkies tragics, but I add that that's probably where the similarities stop. Dad declined the chance to be an MP, and it was a time when mum, as a woman, would have never even be considered, and that's a shame. What it did mean, however, was that the Sheldon household was one of fiery and spirited debate. Such was the vigour, Mr President, that we could have used your services and standing orders. On the winning side were my siblings, Cath, Diane, John, Lynne and Phil. On the other side was a young Tony. Standing here today, as a senator in the parliament of Australia, with my family in the gallery, the temptation to relitigate those lost battles under the veil of parliamentary privilege is absolutely overwhelming, but I will resist. I am forever grateful to my parents and siblings. I thank them for their love, counsel and friendship. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I joined the ALP at the age of 14. The fact that one wasn't allowed to join until the age of 15 didn't seen especially important, particularly when your dad was a returning officer! From this day on, the ALP, and the trade union movement, would become a second family. In this extended family, I've met and worked with the very best. I speak of the National Secretary of the Transport Workers Union, the mighty Michael Kaine. Michael's a formidable leader and the best friend and best lieutenant a person could have. He has a stellar team, including Nick McIntosh and Emily McMillan; New South Wales is led by Richard Olsen and his deputy Mick Pieri; and across the country there are John Berger, Tim Dawson, Ian Smith and Peter Biagini. They are able, committed and decent people, one and all. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay special tribute to a man who was a special friend and mentor, the former Senator Steve Hutchins. When ex-Labor parliamentarian Michael Lee gave the eulogy at Steve's funeral, he quoted from Kim Beazley: 'The industrial movement is critical for a democracy. Ordinary Australians can speak through it on the needs of everyday Australians in a debate dominated by privilege and elites. Grounded by this, Steve took the voices of working people into a parliamentary career of real substance and achievement.' I recall in 1994 Steve called me and my workmate Wayne Forno to his office. He was as fired up as you could be, railing against the low wages of our members and the greed of some of the transport industry's major clients. He asked this question: 'What good are we if we allow this to continue?' He then told us that they needed a 15 per cent wage increase over two years. Privately, Wayne and I thought Steve was being a little bit optimistic. Truth be told, we may have used different and much more exotic language at the time, given the scale of the ask, but we fell in behind the leader, as loyal people do.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">What happened next? This great man, with no hope of success, succeeded, bringing all the benefits it generated for hundreds of thousands of both union and non-union transport workers' families. Millions of dollars were then spent generating and sustaining thousands of jobs. If all of Steve's leadership could be condensed into a sentence, it would be this: never limit your self-beliefs, always upsize your dreams and then fight like hell to achieve them. Thank you, Steve. Rest well, comrade. I welcome to the Senate Natalie, Xavier and Linda, Steve's family, here today. My friends, your dad, brother and husband will always be one of the greats.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In the movement, of course, there are other greats as well. Wonderful men and women like Gerard Hayes, Graeme Kelly, Alex Glayson and Bob Nandar, Daniel Walton and Bernie Smith, Gerard Dwyer and Barbara Neebard, Michael Crosby—with a tie—Mich-Elle Myers, Arthur Rorris, Nadine Flood and Natalie Lang, Martin Cartwright and Steve Purvenus, David Smith, Robert Potter, Shane Murphy, Michael O'Connor and Paddy Crumlin, of course. I also offer a sincere thank you to the secretary of Unions NSW, Mark Morey. Mark is doing an outstanding job for all affiliates and their communities in New South Wales, aided by his deputies, Thomas and Vanessa.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">To another outstanding union leader, Sally McManus, I say this: leadership is about having the courage of your convictions. By that definition, Sally McManus is pure leadership. Good on you, Sally and Michele and the team at the ACTU, including my good, thoughtful and determined friend Scott Connolly. I'm here with the intention to change the rules, as is our shared credo.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In New South Wales, I also thank and recognise Kaila Murnain, alongside her deputies Pat and George. Kaila has reformed the culture of New South Wales ALP head office in a way which was sorely needed. I thank Daniel Mookie, a true and loyal friend of great integrity, as well as Adam Searle and Mark Buttigieg, who fight every day in the New South Wales parliament for working people. Thank you for joining me today.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank former leader Bill Shorten, a man who has given his life to working people. Bill was right to call out the influence of Clive Palmer, a person who won't pay his workers' wages yet claims a right to the moral high ground. I also enthusiastically endorse the new leader of the parliamentary Labor Party, Anthony Albanese. There is no-one more authentic than Albo. Someone remarked to me the other day that they were surprised to see the Leader of the Opposition on television wearing a Rabbitohs jersey. I responded by saying I'm truly surprised any time I see him in a suit and tie. I suspect Albo might say the same thing about me.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I also acknowledge all of my caucus colleagues, both in the House and in the Senate led by Penny Wong and Kristina Keneally. And I welcome my fellow new ALP senators, Tim Ayres, Marielle Smith, Raff Ciccone and Nita Green. I also acknowledge some splendid friends from the other side of politics: Duncan Gay, the former roads minister in New South Wales, and Mike Gallacher, the former minister for police in New South Wales. They are decent people who made negotiations and discussions robust but always rewarding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">On this note, again, I reference Steve Hutchins's magnificent 15 per cent pay rise victory. I also recognise Lindsay Fox. Lindsay has always been direct, honest, frank and true to his word. With Lindsay it's always been an interest based negotiation to get a fair outcome for all parties. They are the sorts of negotiations I have also enjoyed with the likes of the unique Michael Byrne from Toll—an old friend—Paul Ryan, Peter Anderson, Peter Fox and Hugh McMaster, Laurie de Peace, Maurice Boroni, John Begetti, and Terry and Arthur Tzaneros, two wonderful people, employers who also understand that honest and genuine disagreement can yield good results. These are the captains of industry who distinguish themselves from a small minority of others. I refer to the Leigh Cliffords of the world, people who are not in control of their ideology and who would and have grounded an airline for pride. Enough said about these types. I will have plenty of opportunities in the next six years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I have entered parliament with 42 years in the workforce. Every battle scar and every victory are lessons I carry with me to this very moment. I've been a garbo and a bar attendant. My first job was as a 16-year-old amusement park worker at the Punchbowl fair. For the record, and as a rejection of the claim of my children, I stress that I was not the amusement! I was the Ferris wheel operator, working unpaid for six weeks on the promise of more work, which never arrived—an early lesson never forgotten.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Later I stood with decent and hardworking brewery workers in the first-ever sit-in in Castlemaine brewery against unfair and uneven wage increases. I stood up against the likes of the infamous Bellino brothers, of Fitzgerald inquiry fame, who ran illegal nightclubs in Brisbane, grossly underpaying their workforce. The inquiry was a response to a series of articles about high-level police corruption, reported by Phil Dickie and then immortalised in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> report by Chris Masters in 1987. I've led what the local paper called the 'petticoat picket' at Cedar Lake on the Gold Coast, against sexual harassment, discrimination, victimisation, underpayments and bullying, where men and women were sacked because, they were told, they were 'too old' to be a good image for the company.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I've taken calls from truck drivers who were being force-supplied by their employers with drugs to keep them awake in an effort to meet the cost demands of clients—drivers who were told that if they contacted the police or didn't take the drugs they would lose their jobs and worse. I've been to the funerals of those who have paid the ultimate price, comforting loved ones in the depths of unimaginable grief. That is why I vow that I will not rest until this parliament restores safe rates into this country.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I witnessed the collapse of the national airline under a narrow-minded government. I've stood with brave men and women, like Dave Lupton from Ansett—and Dave's with us today—for more than 100 days to win a government-guaranteed redundancy payment. Like many others, I've sat at the witness box at a royal commission, with no prima facie case to answer for anything. That trade union royal commission will be forever remembered as a wretched abuse of executive power, where the presumption of innocence became a presumption of guilt. And all the while the government of the day evaded, protected and denied the misdeeds of a banking sector which was institutionally, morally and culturally corrupt, demonstrating the real aim, which is this government's obsessive culture war on working people and their representatives. I had four hours in the witness box—I won't go so far as to say that Justice Heydon and I became friends; that would obviously be a bit much—but by the end, the commission understood that the Transport Workers' Union was a collective of terrific people bonded by decency, integrity and a determination to support our members. I add that these were also the values missing in the executive ranks of the banking sector.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Friends, beyond our shores I've been honoured to lead negotiations for international safe rates agreements and road safety under the auspices of the International Labour Organization, including in the Mekong Delta and South Korea. I take this opportunity to advise the Senate that as of July this year South Korea has achieved safe rates.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I've observed with a quiet but growing rage as migrant workers without the rights of Australian citizens have their labour exploited. This undercuts the wages of local labour as well, a crazy double whammy benefitting very few.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I've watched with concern as both Labor and coalition parties tore down multiple prime ministers, with the unintended consequences of emptying the reservoir of goodwill that our people have towards their democracy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm in this place to speak up for dignity, good work and rewarding jobs, for decent wages and safe conditions and for long-term employment that allows you to get a mortgage and provide for your family with certainty—the pathway to economic freedom. We must reject aggressive, value-neutral supply chains monopolising and using technology as a barbed wire chain around the throats of business and workers down the line.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to reference perhaps the greatest achievement of my life, solely because it was utterly unique in Australian political life. I have managed to receive a written apology from Senator Eric Abetz. Sure, Eric, the apology was in order to head off defamation proceedings. But, with Eric, one takes what one can get. I wish you could've gone to court, Senator. My mortgage could've used the relief. But, in fairness, I also appreciate the frank conversations I've had with Eric and other conservative workplace ministers over the years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">What all these experiences and observations mean is that I entered parliament with broad perspectives. In my inaugural address, I'd like to share three of these.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The first perspective is about what government's role should be in designing and regulating markets. Simply put, governments and parliaments must start leading with effective market design and regulation, rather than chasing with ineffective versions of neither. There are now modern, international goliaths in the information age, just as there were international behemoths in the first industrial and global trade ages. I speak of Uber, Amazon, Facebook, Google and their like—unaccountable titans who seek to have the market operate in their self-interest. The regulation of these global tech giants by democratically elected leaders is failing in our economy and our democracy. Governments need to catch up and get out in front of deregulating these disrupters, and my pledge in this place is that I will do everything in my power to thoughtfully and unapologetically disrupt the disrupters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We must tackle the tax relationship. We need to hold these global companies economically accountable so they can contribute their fair share of tax, like France is doing with its new three per cent digital services tax on revenue generated in its territory. France, like India, has had the courage to implement this simple, transparent tax—one which tackles head on the scourge of multinational tax avoidance. The OECD and a number of European countries are looking at this and other tax models, and it's time for Australia to do the same. I say that, as responsible legislators, we cannot wait for other countries to act. We cannot stand by and watch while our tax base is eroded and, with it, our ability to provide health, education and other critical infrastructure for our citizens.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We must better define the regulatory relationship with these companies. We need real laws, not toothless voluntary codes, to ensure that all workers, consumers and small businesses have their rights, including data rights, protected and have a fair go in this emerging information economy. In saying this, I recognise all the good brought about by innovation, and I do welcome it. But regulating the transaction cost is our job, so let's get to it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, I have a perspective about the question this Senate must consider if we are to avoid the future of work being less utopia and more dystopia. I have watched the transport industry become ground zero for the impacts of a changing global economy and the massive technology driven disruption of firms like Uber, Foodora and Deliveroo. Make no mistake, this disruption is coming to every corner of our economy. The basic rights of working people are under threat from the gig economy, tech platforms, artificial intelligence and worker surveillance systems. Don't believe the spin. This is not a sharing economy. It's an on-demand economy, and it's incumbent on us to enforce and create rights for these workers. That includes the right to fair pay and superannuation. While the coalition nurtures wreckers of Australian world-leading superannuation, I believe we should extend superannuation to every worker in Australia, including those in the emerging gig economy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">As the recent Select Committee on the Future of Work and Workers found, Australia has no coordinated approach to managing the future of work in Australia. I regard this fact alone as a very bright red-light risk for Australia. Ultimately, how can there be prosperity if we enter a world of permanently high unemployment and permanently higher underemployment?</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I also have a perspective on the dangers our body politic faces if a lack of political engagement further deepens the trust deficit. Whether it be the banks, the Catholic church, the parliament or the tax office—indeed, even the national cricket team lost the faith of our people for a period of time. What I see is an alarming loss of trust in institutions, some fraying of our social cohesion, and a growing sense that many institutions are more self-serving than selfless. In 2019, the Lowy Institute Poll found that 30 per cent of 18- to 29-year-olds said that, in some circumstances, a non-democratic government can be preferable. That's one in three young people. Polling carried out by the Australian Museum of Democracy said that, if current trends continue, Australians' trust in their politicians and political institutions will drop to less than 10 per cent by 2025. Putting this in a commercial sense, a business with so little trust from consumers will simply go out of business. That cannot be the fate of our democracy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Our parliamentarians generally have a lot of common ground, and it's a tragedy that the Australian public is not more aware of it. We need a parliamentary office to communicate the good bipartisan work that gets done here. I believe in plain speaking; in evidence-based policy; in less politics and more policy; and in governments and parliaments who lead and not follow—all underpinned by a core belief in the very decency, fairness and compassion my parents taught their children, Whilst I look forward to the ferocious debate, I utterly reject the notion of winning at all costs, because I believe in my duty to the people of New South Wales and of Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to conclude with the final but most important acknowledgement: I want to thank all of the members of the Transport Workers' Union and every working person who has supported me for so many years. I say to every transport worker in Australia: because you are the men and women who carry Australia, you deserve the respect of all Australians. Some of you are no doubt listening on parliamentary radio as you drive a long haul on the Pacific, Sturt, Bruce or Eyre highways; some working late shifts at the airport, or sitting in the tearoom; and others just getting home, exhausted, to their waiting families. I want to say to these great men and women: it has been my honour to serve you. I'm here because of you, and, now more than ever, in this place I am your servant. To those families who have lost loved ones on the altar of profit, driven by greed or misused technology, or allowed by failed regulation: I remember every single one of you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm honoured to be in this wonderful chamber, and determined to do good and to grasp the moment with everything I have. Thank you, senators; thank you, friends; thank you, family; and thank you, good President.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:33</span>):  The town of Yarrabah is a short drive from my home in Cairns. It is home to the Gunggandji people, a community of artists, activists, teachers and leaders. It is the place where elders, including Aunty Ruth and Uncle Alf, started to organise a campaign that built toward the 1967 referendum. They understood that the necessary ingredients for change were present in the Australian community and that they could, if they persisted, achieve reform and amend the Constitution. In acknowledging the traditional owners of the land we meet on today and the traditional owners of the land I live on in Far North Queensland, I want to pay tribute to Yarrabah, its elders and the activists who refused to take no for an answer. They are ready to lead again and deliver a voice to parliament. I extend to them my support and solidarity. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr President, tonight I'm going talk to you about some of the incredible people who inspired me to become a Queensland senator. I was encouraged to run for public office by people who stand up for what they believe in, who speak up on behalf of others, those who encourage us to<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>hope for the future and insist on making change. These are not the so-called quiet Australians. In fact, many of them are very noisy, and I truly believe that this is an important time to celebrate those in our community who don't remain silent when they witness injustice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, though, I want to say thank you to each and every Queenslander who I am very honoured to represent. After being elected I made this commitment to Queenslanders: in my role as a senator I will be, above all else, hardworking and incredibly grateful for the opportunity to serve my community. That work starts here and it starts now. I love Queensland and I love Queenslanders, so I feel incredibly lucky to be in this position at this time. I am even luckier to call Far North Queensland home. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Queensland is rich in resources and opportunities. Our vast state consists of many communities, all with their own unique identity. And nothing unites us more than our dislike of people down south trying to tell us what to do and how to live. </span>

                <a href="259819" type="MemberContinuation">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator GREEN:</span>
                </a>  Exactly! Brisbane. When I leave this place I want to be able to say that Queensland has more apprentices and job opportunities for young people; has better schools, hospitals and aged-care facilities; has better roads, ports and major infrastructure; has a booming tourism industry; and is equipped to make the most out of the industries of the future. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that these are things that we can all work on together. We know there needs to be more money spent on big infrastructure and shovels in the ground now, in order to grow regional Queensland. But right now all we've got is a lot of promises. Further, the loss of 12,000 apprentices in Queensland means we are facing a skills shortage, which this government wants to address by expanding the skilled visa program. We want these projects built now and we want them built by local workers. In order to grow regional Queensland we also need to have some hard debates. I am ready to take on these debates and win them for Queensland. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Job security for Queenslanders and the dangers of climate change are interlinked. Queenslanders want and deserve secure jobs. On this, let me be clear: whether it is a mine operator in Clermont, a tourism operator in Cairns, a farmer in Innisfail or a Torres Strait Islander on Boigu Island, I will work to ensure that every Queenslander has a genuine role in securing the future of the jobs that feed their families and help create the communities that they call home. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The only way to win an outcome that ensures a prosperous and healthy future for our state is to listen to Queenslanders, not talk at them or speak about them in abstract terms. Every regional Queenslander deserves to be treated with respect. Listening to and respecting Queenslanders is what I have been doing, and it is what I will continue to do as their elected representative in this Senate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Our community is made up of many types of Australians. We've heard a great deal about quiet Australians of late—what they believe; what they want their government to do. We are told they are defined by what they are not. They're not noisy. They don't criticise. And we are told they don't really have time for politics, which I don't think is entirely true. It seems to me a false value is being placed on being not just quiet but also passive or disinterested in politics. It's a view that dismisses Australians who are concerned with what goes on here, who are outspoken, who stand up and make change. History has shown us, time and time again, that we should encourage debate and dissent. In fact, it is dangerous not to. Despite the divisive politics around the world, you'll often hear young people talk about the importance of hope and change. During past times of upheaval and uncertainty, others have often spoken about these ideas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1966 Robert F Kennedy spoke at the University of Cape Town to young South Africans hopeful of change. A fragment of that speech was later recited by Ted Kennedy during the eulogy that he delivered for his brother. With his voice breaking, and in spite of the uncertainty of the time, he chose the passages of Kennedy's speech about hope and the ability of one person, and particularly young people, to make great change. Kennedy said:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Few will have the greatness to bend history; but each of us can work to change a small portion of the events, and in the total of all these acts will be written the history of this generation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is from numberless diverse acts of courage such as these that the belief that human history is thus shaped. Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">When Ted Kennedy delivered those words he was the same age as I am right now. He stood in St Patrick's Cathedral, having just lost two of his brothers, and yet he spoke about hope and insisting on change. Yes, we should respect our quiet Australians, but there will always be a place for people who choose not to remain silent and instead stand up for an ideal to improve the lot of others or strike out against injustice. We also need vocal Australians to inspire us, to lead us and to prepare us for the changes ahead.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The advancement of women's equality and empowerment has been shaped by some very noisy women. I am here today because of the strong noisy women who fought for the right to vote, for equal pay, for equal work and for greater representation in parliament. This includes Senator Claire Moore, who worked tirelessly to give a voice to the voiceless. Now there is a new generation of strong women ready to demand more changes and greater equality. So thank you to all of the strong young women of the Labor Party who inspire me and give me so much strength, especially Jess, Laura, Jo and Alana. I also want to make special mention of two noisy women, Ellie Whitaker and Emily Brogan, who have supported me on every step in this journey.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">My mum is also a strong woman, and without her I wouldn't be here today. Despite the disapproval of her parents, my mum married my dad who was 20 years her senior. Mum was a nurse in an operating theatre, and, like most nurses I meet, she is smart and tough and incredibly hard working. Her primary purpose and concern is always the welfare of others.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Dad was charming and intelligent. He worked hard on night shifts. He was a printer at Fairfax. I knew that he had an important job, because he got the news out. He was a big man, and as a kid you could bury your head into his shoulder and feel protected. I loved him very much. But he was also an alcoholic and he suffered from depression. He was cruel when he was sober and he was abusive when he was drunk. He was supposed to protect us, but no-one protected us from him.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was three or four years old, my mum left in the middle of the night—me walking alongside my brother in a stroller and our bags on our backs. When I asked her why we were walking the long way around the block, she said, 'So daddy doesn't see us.' Leaving, finally, for good, almost 10 years later, was the best decision my mum ever made. We were homeless for the first few nights after we left, because the rental that mum paid for wasn't liveable. Tragically, domestic violence remains one of the biggest drivers of homelessness for Australian women. We finally settled in a small community of town houses occupied by families on minimum-wage jobs, single parents and new migrants. Mum packed shelves at night to make ends meet.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I have no doubt that it was hard for mum to leave. She shouldn't have had to do it on her own, but, like so many women, she did. For all the struggle that life of a single mother would bring, every day I was so grateful to be safe. It made who I am today—tough, resilient and unwilling to accept that some Australians have to settle for less just because of where they were born or who their parents are. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">One in five women in Australia has experienced family violence. Sadly, hospitalisation rates as a result of family violence are on the rise. Family violence is a health crisis and a cultural crisis, and it has to stop. We can't be hopeful or well-meaning anymore; we must demand that it changes. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Mum gave me many gifts throughout my life: a safe home, self-belief and the understanding that tough times don't last forever. She has three rules in life: you have to be home on Christmas Eve, never ride a motorcycle—she's a nurse—and never ever cross a picket line. So, on top of all of the other gifts she gave me, she made me a good trade unionist. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">As a young person who always felt that a country as rich as Australia should look after our most vulnerable first, I was naturally drawn to the trade union movement. Being a union member is about making noise, because being in a union makes your voice much louder. The hopes, rights and voices of a single worker are amplified through our collectivism. Unionism is the personification of those tiny ripples of hope Robert F Kennedy spoke about. It is the coming together and the knocking down of the walls of oppression, injustice and greed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queensland Trades and Labour Council worked alongside the elders in Yarrabah in the lead-up to the 1967 referendum because they saw injustice and oppression in the conditions and the discrimination faced by Indigenous communities. As a union lawyer, campaigner and industrial officer, I've met many Queenslanders who have been subjected to exploitation, wage theft and workplace safety breaches and have faced discrimination in the workplace. Without union representation and the support and solidarity of their workmates, these workers would have had little to no chance of achieving a fair and just outcome.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This week we have seen a worker killed and others seriously injured in two separate crane accidents in Far North Queensland. We need strong unions in this country because every Australian worker has the right to come home to their family at the end of the day. My union—the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union—has a proud tradition of standing up for what is right. The recent victory for workers at the long-running Esso Longford dispute highlights the strength, tenacity and commitment of the AMWU and its partner unions in fighting for a fair go for Australian workers. I applaud each and every delegate and official from the AMWU and other unions for their dedication to supporting workers. I thank especially Queensland State Secretary, Rohan Webb, and Ann-Marie Allan. I also thank Peter Koutsoukis and Rod Hodgson from Maurice Blackburn Lawyers, who gave me a chance and the opportunity to grow.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that Senator Sheldon has been in the party since he was 14 years old. When I was younger I didn't plan to come to politics, but in 2011 at the national conference the Australian Labor Party inspired me to be part of change. I wasn't a member or a volunteer at the time, but I got to witness the robust debate on the Barr-Wong amendment that led to marriage equality becoming part of the party platform. In speaking to her amendment Senator Wong said something that resonates with me to this day. She said, 'Equality does not diminish the worth of your relationships; it simply recognises the worth of ours.' Meanwhile, the member for Sydney, Tanya Plibersek, reassured teenagers around the country that they were 'just fine'. The now Leader of the Opposition, Anthony Albanese, spoke of Labor's preparedness to examine itself and move forward. Albo articulated how Labor would take up the fight for the elimination of all discrimination—be it based on race, gender or class. When the vote was finalised, the then ALP national president, Senator McAllister, simply said the words, 'I declare the amendment carried.' From that moment onwards, I saw a place for me in the Labor Party because I also believed in fairness and equality. Labor, not only a party of government but in government, held the same view.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Seven years later, as a member of the Labor Party, I took all the hurt and fear that I felt about the same-sex marriage plebiscite and threw myself into campaigning for marriage equality. In my role organising volunteers in Brisbane and throughout Queensland, I had the chance to meet so many wonderful people. They were gay, straight, old and young and all they wanted to do was fight for change. They were the tiny little ripples that created a giant wave of support. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">One of those volunteers stands out the most. A few days after voting closed, I organised an event to thank our volunteers. Amongst the rainbow flags and streamers, I spotted a man wearing a Transport Workers' Union t-shirt. I have to admit, he looked a little out of place! He came up to me and said, 'This campaign saved my life.' I knew from the way that he said it that he meant what he said. I hugged him, feeling proud of the work we'd done and relief that we had saved his life. But there was also white, hot anger—anger about the lives that we couldn't save; anger about the number of LGBTI people who commit suicide; anger about all of the people who were forced to live their lives like I did for a long time, unable to be fully and authentically themselves.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In the end, Queensland—my Queensland—voted 60.7 per cent for yes. From Coolangatta to the cape, Queensland said yes to equality and love. I want to acknowledge Rainbow Labor and my friends from the Equality Campaign. I am very proud to know you all. Thank you Joseph, Patrick, Georgia and the rest of the team. And thank you to George Simon, a good ally who told me that he would lie down on a road for any of those people, so I was completely nuts if I didn't take the chance to work with them. I'm so grateful I listened to his advice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very thankful for the work that many in this place did to achieve marriage equality. I acknowledge Senator Dean Smith especially and Senator Wong, Senator Louise Pratt and Senator Janet Rice and the other champions and allies we have in this house. In the end, no single party or politician delivered marriage equality. The victory belonged to many Australians, and I want to acknowledge the LGBTI activists who worked for decades. They spoke out not only when it was unpopular but also when it was unthinkable. I want to acknowledge all of the allies who had never fought before but marched with us. They wrapped their arms around us when we needed it the most. Australians showed that, collectively, they can be powerful and vocal and respectful and loving. We demanded change and we got it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I finish, I want to say thank you to my friends and family who travelled here today. A special thank you to my oldest friends, the ones who knew me before politics and still put up with me afterwards, especially Jackie and Jess. Thank you, Ben, for your help, advice and chocolate runs. Thank you to my colleagues in this place new and old, and a special thanks to Senator Murray Watt, who I met at my first campaign meeting. Who would have thought we'd be here now? Thank you for your friendship, humour and advice. Thank you to my wife's family for making me feel so at home. Thank you Vicki and Warren, who couldn't be here tonight, but I know they send their love. Thank you to my mum and my brother, Rohan, for everything you have done for me. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">During the recent election campaign, Mum would text me out of the blue and say something along the lines of: 'Are you on the bus today? How is Penny?' At the same time, I discovered I had a strange new Twitter follower. I put two and two together and discovered that my mum had created a Twitter account just to follow what I was doing on the campaign, which made me realise, of course, that I was being a very bad daughter. Mum, I promise to tweet a little less, to call a little more and to make you proud every day.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, to my wife, Lacey: Lacey is funny, sweet and wise. She is the coolest person I know. She's a teacher, a designer and a very good cook. Life with Lacey is always an adventure: she's either taking you on one or she is happy to come along on yours. Our lives have changed in so many ways since we met. I am proud of her, and she is proud of me. Thank you, honey, for your support today and every day and the huge sacrifices that you will make now and into the future. I love you very much.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The elders in Yarrabah, with all of the barriers that stood before them, refused to take no for an answer. The union movement in Cairns stood beside them and fought for change, as they have done now for over 200 years. Sometimes this parliament lags behind the momentum for change that builds in our community. It was true of marriage equality; it is true of constitutional recognition. That's why we need Australians who stand up and speak out. If you are a young Australian and you want to change our country and make it better, you can. Never give up, join your union and don't be afraid to make some noise. Thank you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="204953" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLACHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:00</span>):  I am very happy to continue on this very important matter of public importance. At the outset, I want to comment on the two proceeding contributions. As always, the contribution from Senator Stoker was as dry economically as you can get—there is nothing to see here; there are no problems here; it is all sweetness and roses. Nothing could be further from the truth. Senator Siewert, at least in the short time I've been here, has been consistent on this platform. She has been consistent on the social platform of equity and opportunity for people who find themselves unfortunate enough to be attracting either Newstart or the myriad of other social security payments. She has carried that challenge right throughout the several parliaments that I've been a part of. I don't want her to be on her own in this argument, and I don't think she is on her own in this argument.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at the statistics, in South Australia, as you may well be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, the statistics are simple and clear. There are 65,558 South Australians on Newstart, and we can look at where those people are. We know that Spence has 11,687 people on Newstart, the second-highest number in Australia, with only Lingiari, an electorate I'm sure my colleague Senator Dodson is well familiar with, having a higher number of people on Newstart. If you look at the seat of Grey, 9,382 persons are on Newstart. You can start to dig into this detail, and I'll go through South Australia. In Barker there are 6,804. In Kingston there are 6,590. Interestingly, in the metropolitan seat of Adelaide, there are 6,462. In the seat of Makin there are 5,951. In the seat of Hindmarsh there are 5,909. In Mayo there are 4,566. In Boothby there are 4,443. In the seat of Sturt there are 3,758.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There isn't a state or territory or, indeed, a federal electorate in Australia that doesn't have a reasonably large component of people on the Newstart system. We heard from the Hon. Mathias Cormann that it's a transition payment. But if you dig into that it is not true. There is a growing proportion of people who are on it for over 12 months. They're on $555-odd a fortnight if they're a single person. That is impossible. I don't even think we should be asking ourselves whether you could survive on $40 a day, because clearly 98 per cent of the community would have no hope of meeting their obligations in respect to shelter, food, public transport and the wherewithal for their children at that level. It's just impossible. In fact, the real question is: what level of support are people getting from family, friends and charities to allow them to subsist on that contribution? And how big is that growing proportion of people who are just falling out of shelter?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They're living in cardboard boxes on Swanston Street. They're sheltering in parks. I'm fond of a bit of exercise in the morning and it's not unusual, when you walk through a park in any city in Australia in the morning, to see people sleeping in it because that is the only place they can go. It may be the only safe haven they've got because the value of Newstart will not allow them a roof or shelter. We are not doing enough in this space. I don't know what the fiscal answer is or whether it's the suggestion by Senator Siewert and others of a $75 increase. I'm not sure that would make a huge difference, but I am sure of this: the parliament should be looking at the fundamental aspects of this, the underlying causes of this, the geographical spread of this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Take Lingiari. If you're at Docker River or Lajamanu or Peppimenarti or Yuendumu, no-one is going to start a business up there tomorrow and offer you a job. That ain't going to happen. There is limited opportunity for employment; there is limited opportunity for training. These people are routinely thrown off Newstart because they didn't go to a job interview. Well, you can't go to a job interview that's not there! I well remember an estimates hearing with the secretary of Human Services saying how they stop people's payments and how they transacted this policy. I said, 'What do you do?' and they said, 'We write them a letter to say they haven't complied, and within 14 days their payment will be stopped.' I said, 'That's fine. The only problem I have is that the last time I was at Yuendumu I never saw any letterboxes, so where do those letters actually go? Do you know that they actually get to a person who is able to read it, comprehend what's going on and respond or are you just using some governance and due diligence process that turfs people off? Is it that, when they don't have any money and they've starved for a couple of days, they'll find someone who can interpret for them and you'll probably get a reaction? Is that what you're doing?' The answer was, 'No, Senator, we're not doing that.' The processes and the administration of the system for people who are so far behind the eight ball need to be looked at.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Dodson is correct. We want to know who the beneficiaries are in this system. If an inordinate amount of tax dollars are spent in this area, how much is spent on governance, compliance and due diligence? Are people getting an income out of supplying the Indue card, or whatever the card or the flavour will be? Are people making money out of the administration of a deficient system? I have the very quaint view, I suppose, that perhaps government should look at private equity for some solutions. We can't keep doing the wrong thing. We can't keep doing the same thing and getting the same result. That's madness. We need to look at things in a much more innovative way. Are we able to break cycles of poverty, desperation and subsistence living with a different way of doing things? We all read widely and we get reports, and we know there are different ways of looking at this problem. We don't appear to have moved anywhere from: 'They appear to not be doing the right thing, so let's punish them.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am disturbed that, when you go a social worker in a Centrelink office, they will openly and honestly list the things that should be done to enable people to move to proper attendance at job interviews and have a chance of a successful interview. If their teeth are gone or their teeth are not repaired, they can't open their mouth, they can't smile or they can't talk properly, you're really asking a lot of someone to go to a number of job interviews. If they are suffering some psychosocial disability which is not being treated, it's going to be very difficult to move those people forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A person sticks in my mind. He was on the phone for 40 minutes in the Centrelink office. He took the phone and started banging it on the counter until someone came and interacted with him. The interaction he needed was some assistance for a bus fare to travel to Melbourne for his grandfather's funeral. The system we have is: 'Do not speak to a real person. Go to a computer, go to a phone and wait and wait and wait. I think the transitional arrangements are such that a lot of people don't wait; they go away, and they're counted as victories. The issue still remains. We really do need to do a whole lot better in this space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I return to South Australia. In the seat of Spence there are 11,687 people who are on Newstart and youth allowance. That is an absolute disaster. That's almost 10 per cent of the federal electorate. If that's not an issue that should challenge every member of parliament, I don't know what is. And each one of those people would have friends and relatives—mothers, fathers, uncles and aunts—so there is a broad community knowledge of this. But the community is doing the right thing; otherwise we would see many more problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is incumbent on this chamber and the other chamber to really lift our game in this space and to take a leaf out of some of our new senators' speeches. Why don't we work on what's possible across the chamber? Why are we engaged in political pointscoring on the most vulnerable in the community? I think it's a real tragedy and I'm deeply saddened by the fact that we do seem to pointscore over people who are in dire straits and need a leg-up, not a handout.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FARUQI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:10</span>):  I rise to speak on the matter of public importance before us today. Newstart is no longer a transition payment, and people receiving Newstart and youth allowance are living in poverty. That is the reality today. We know that Newstart is no longer a transitional payment. We know that 44 per cent of people who are on it are on it for more than two years at a time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say how proud I am of my Greens colleague Senator Rachel Siewert for her persistent and passionate work to make life better for those who are doing it tough. We know that Newstart, youth allowance and other support allowances are not enough. The single rate of Newstart is a mere $40 a day. Insufficient doesn't even begin to describe it. After paying their rent, Newstart recipients are left with $17 per day. No-one can live on that. Maybe the government senators here can tell me what they should go without—food? Electricity? Medicine? A roof over their head? Maybe you have some brilliant, innovative ideas on how someone forced to live without basic necessities can choose one which is more important than the other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our safety net is consistently being eroded, and people on income support are a target for ideological attacks and so-called savings. This is a national shame. You have no right to say, 'The best form of welfare is a job.' This is a line I'm so sick and tired of hearing from the Liberals, and yet we heard it again and again today from Senator Cash and Senator Stoker. It is patronising in the extreme. It is also particularly dishonest, because you refuse to recognise that poverty is a massive barrier to employment. Until people can eat, pay their rent, afford transport and access communications services such as a phone and the internet, they will be extremely limited in their ability to build a life and find employment. Newstart is too low to give people the support they desperately need to get through tough times. And with your refusal to raise Newstart, you are condemning people to cycle upon cycle of poverty.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of coming up with good, evidence-based public policy, this government has come up with ineffective and punitive programs like Work for the Dole, jobactive and ParentsNext, which actually demonise people. These programs force everyone who is struggling into a one-size-fits-all model. Evidence has repeatedly shown that these do not work and that they're causing serious harm. We need approaches that fit individual circumstances and respond to barriers people face, particularly for young people, older Australians, people with disability and First Nations people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of having compassion, the government is using some of the most vulnerable people in the country as political footballs. The Liberals have chosen to take an ideological approach to unemployment, framing it as a personal moral failing of individuals, rather than addressing the systemic issues such as poverty, intergenerational trauma and job-market conditions. Even 27 years ago, as a new migrant, when I relied on the dole to get by, it was hard to live on those support payments, and it is shocking that, despite the skyrocketing cost of living, the rate of Newstart has not risen in real terms in over two decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Rachel Siewert has been sharing the experiences of people on Newstart in this chamber almost every week. So you really don't need much more evidence to know that people are really struggling. You don't even need to go very far to get this information.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has taken to using abhorrent terms like 'unfunded empathy' when referring to an increase in Newstart. The Liberals certainly find the money when they need to subsidise fossil fuels and they can certainly find the money when they sign-off on massive tax cuts for big corporations, so how come there is no money for the most vulnerable people who need it?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliament has the chance to make a real, concrete difference to people's lives and ensure that no-one is forced to live in poverty in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have been calling on the government to raise Newstart for years. The Liberal government should know that there's a growing number of us in this place, and out there in the community, who will not stop until we make sure that every Australian can live a life of dignity.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:15</span>):  No-one is saying that it's easy to get by without a job, which is why the Morrison government is squarely focused on job creation to help working age Australians gain financial independence. We're delivering results, with more than 1.3 million jobs created since we were elected, which is about 240,000 a year—compared to just 155,000 a year, on average, under Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Newstart is a taxpayer funded allowance that provides a safety net for people while they look for a job, and has already increased twice a year every year in line with CPI. The government's approach to assisting people on Newstart is focused on our success in getting people off welfare payments and into a job. Around two-thirds of those granted Newstart get off the payment within 12 months. Everyone who receives Newstart is eligible for some form of additional assistance from the welfare system. Ninety-nine per cent of Newstart allowance recipients receive an additional supplementary payment such as rental assistance, parenting payments or the energy supplement, which works out to an average extra $130 a fortnight on top of the $555 base rate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Welfare cost more than $172 billion in 2018-19, representing more than $1 in $3, or 35 per cent of all spending by the government. It is the responsibility of government to ensure our social security and welfare systems are sustainable into the future, so that it continues to provide support for those most in need. As the PM said last year, 'If the government had the money to raise Newstart I reckon I would be doing it for pensioners first.' The Labor Party played a cruel joke in the lead-up to the election by claiming that they would review the rate of Newstart but did not budget for any of its increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a strong safety net for those that need it most. Few countries provide the strong safety net that we have in Australia. The welfare system is funded by taxpayers and needs to be managed responsibly. The responsibility extends to taxpayers who are paying for our welfare bill now and to the future generations who will have to meet the cost of the system in the decades to come. This means the system must be fair and sustainable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government recognises that there are times when people need a safety net to help them when they're down on their luck. In Australia, we have a very comprehensive and targeted welfare system that is there to assist those who are doing it tough. At the same time, we have to be fair to taxpayers, as well as to welfare recipients, because we have to understand that every dollar that is spent on welfare is a contribution from the taxpayer. There is no magic pudding. The money has to come from somewhere. We want a fair go for taxpayers. That's why our welfare system needs to be targeted to those who need it; not those who would like to have it. It needs to be targeted, sustainable and in line with community expectations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to help people who are doing it tough in the future it's the responsibility of the government to ensure that the welfare system is sustainable. With the Morrison government's economic management it is important to ensure that we have a social safety net that we can rely on, so it continues to provide the support to those that need it the most and who will rely on into the future. The government wants a welfare system that supports our most vulnerable and encourages those who are capable of work or study to do so. Most importantly, it reduces intergenerational welfare dependency. We also need to ensure that the system is sustainable into the future. The wellbeing of vulnerable Australians remains a high priority for the Morrison government. Around $29 billion is invested each year to support families through family tax benefit, childcare payments and paid parental leave. Over $827 million is invested in the 2019-20 year through the Department of Social Services' Families and Communities Program to support vulnerable families, improve children's wellbeing, reduce the cost of family breakdown, improve financial capability and literacy, and build strong and resilient communities. The Department of Social Services provides around $2 billion to more than 8,000 organisations that are specifically set up to help our most vulnerable Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government's focus on a strong economy is working. We're delivering the job opportunities Australians need. This government has seen the largest increase in jobs since the global financial crisis, with more than 1.3 million jobs since we were elected. The proportion of Australians receiving working-age income support payments has fallen to its lowest level in 30 years, at 14.3 per cent. There were 230,000 fewer working-age recipients on income support payments in June 2018, compared to June 2014. More than 100,000 young Australians between the ages of 15 and 24 found jobs—that is the highest number in Australia's history. To put that into perspective, 52,000 jobs were lost in the same category between November 2007 and August 2013. This means tax relief for 10 million taxpayers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite played a cruel joke on Australians in the lead-up to the election, claiming that they would review the rate of Newstart but doing nothing to budget for its increase. Labor voted in the Senate against the motion to increase the rate of Newstart as recently as 4 July 2019. Prior to the election, their policy was a review, and then a review, with no 'view' of lowering the rate. Labor have not been clear in what they offer to people trying to get off welfare and into work. When it comes to welfare spending, the difference between the coalition and Labor is that only the coalition is able to maintain the sustainability of the welfare system. When Labor were in office, the rate of increase in spending on welfare far outpaced the rate of growth in tax revenue. Labor's position on this important welfare payment changes almost every day. This flip-flopping started in the lead-up to the election, when Labor claimed they would review the rate of Newstart, but, as I said, did nothing to budget for its increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one is saying that it would be easy to live on Newstart. The government understands this. It understands that Australians are doing it tough. Newstart is a safety net. It's not meant to be a replacement of salary. The focus of Newstart, combined with our government's additional supports and programs, is to help people who find themselves on hard times, to support them to get back into the workforce. Whether it's Work for the Dole or Youth Jobs PaTH—which is a fantastic program that all employers across Australia should think about getting on board with, because it's an opportunity for them to connect with young people that just want to have a crack and get entrance into the workplace—we're helping Australians to get a job so that they can earn a wage that creates a better future for them and their families. The Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey shows little net change in income inequality between 2001 and 2017. Indeed, it has come down slightly under the coalition from 0.304 to 0.302, with a lower number indicating lower levels of inequality. The survey shows that the proportion of the population below the relative poverty line has fluctuated over time but the broad trend has been downwards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, as I said in my first speech last night, I've had a long experience working with some of Australia's most vulnerable people and helping them find work. I've never been unemployed for a great period of time, so it's true I haven't walked in the shoes myself, but I've walked alongside a lot of people who have. I'm really committed to improving the system that helps people get off welfare and into work. It's one of the things that I bring into this place, and I'll be looking forward to working with the government to ensure that we do what we can to get more people off welfare and into work.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:25</span>):  There is one thing and one thing alone that keeps the Newstart rate in Australia low, and that is the moral judgement of Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Every party in this chamber except the one that he leads and his supplicant party in the National Party supports a raise to Newstart. In fact, some of them have started to have the courage to speak out. I heard some pretty mealy-mouthed contributions in the Senate this afternoon on this subject and I imagine we're going to hear a few more this evening. There are even members of his own party who believe that we need to raise the rate of Newstart. Senator Sinodinos has had a bit to say on the subject. The bloke that they idolise, former Prime Minister John Howard, whose opinion I imagine should be taken account of in the Liberal Party, has had a bit to say about the subject. Former leaders of the Liberal Party have been out in the community talking about the need to raise Newstart. But this show over here can't find it in its heart to raise the rate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We could start that process immediately, not with resolutions in the Senate but with changes to regulation and legislation. But there is one man in the way, one man who refuses to admit that Newstart is too low. The words can't escape his mouth. There are formulations like, 'I know it would be difficult,' and, 'I can't imagine that it would be easy.' Those are the sorts of mealy-mouthed contributions. Prime Minister Scott Morrison is going to stand in the way of lifting the rate of Newstart until he's dragged kicking and screaming to the conclusion that the government can't do anything else.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to ask the question: why? What's stopping him? He has the numbers in this parliament. He has support within his own party. If he was concerned about the fiscal impacts of raising Newstart, why not commence a review? He hasn't hesitated before making other choices that have had an impact on the budget position of the Commonwealth—for example, stage 3 tax cuts. The Grattan Institute says that in 2025, towards the end of the 2020s, there will need to be expenditure cuts in the range of $40 billion per annum. There is no hesitation for tax cuts for high-income earners. There is no hesitation making the choice to drive the agenda for corporate tax cuts, which again would have had a significant impact upon the fiscal capacity of the Commonwealth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the Prime Minister for a political stunt. He is prepared to cough up $1½ billion of Commonwealth expenditure to reopen Christmas Island just for a press conference and to try to make a political point. He's all heart and all courage when it comes to his own interests but he's got no capacity for empathy with ordinary Australians who find themselves unemployed. It comes down to a question of moral judgement. He either believes that Newstart recipients deserve the indignity of living on $40 a day or he believes that he should ignore them. He thinks that he can ignore them because in Scott Morrison's Australia everybody is a winner. The government is on your side, apparently, but only if we ignore the people who don't matter to him. Because, in his Australia, nobody is poor, that he can see; nobody is unemployed; nobody is ever laid off; nobody is homeless; and nobody ever goes hungry. According to this lot over here, everything is going really well, and if these things do happen to people, well, they just don't matter. They have no place in his moral imagination. I had a few things to say about Scott Morrison and unfunded empathy last night, and I thank the chamber for being accommodating about it. I said that his remarks were grotesque, cowardly and dishonest—</span>

It's an opportunity to say what you really think, and it's an opportunity to say what the right course is for the country. I think it's worth returning to the Prime Minister's first speech, which he gave to the House of Representatives on 14 February 2008, following his election in Cook. Incidentally, that was the very moment that he switched his support from the Sydney Roosters to the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in another craven attempt to suck up to the people of Cook. Here is what he said: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to quote Desmond Tutu, of all people. He said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">... we expect Christians ... to be those who stand up for the truth, to stand up for justice, to stand on the side of the poor and the hungry, the homeless and the naked, and when that happens, then Christians will be trustworthy believable witnesses.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He's happy to talk about compassion and welfare when it is easy, when it is rhetoric and when it doesn't mean anything to the one in 10 households that live in poverty, but, when it comes to the substantial business of taking care of the poor, he has only unfunded empathy. It's an appearance. It's a performance. It's a line for the cameras and for the radio. The Prime Minister is a hollow man with hollow words.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Newstart rate of $40 a day is not dignity. It's destitution. It's pushing people further into poverty. It's actively preventing them from getting work. Seven hundred and twenty-two thousand Australians and their families rely upon the Newstart rate. I've seen what this means for working people. Working people who've lost their jobs are on average on Newstart for three years. Workers that have been left behind by change in the economy deserve a bit of dignity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fifty thousand workers were left behind by the closure of the auto industry, as were thousands of workers in other manufacturing sectors. Of course, factory closures have been a feature of this government. The evidence shows that when a factory closes one-third of workers get another job, one-third of workers retire and one-third never work again. Twenty-five per cent of Newstart recipients are over 55—that's nearly 200,000 Australians. Council on the Ageing's CEO, Ian Yates, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There are more unemployed workers between 55 and 64 than any other group of Australians and they receive Newstart income support payments longer than any other group as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They're condemned for the rest of their working-age life to $40 a day and a regime of weekly, punitive interventions. Newstart is too low to allow these workers to rebuild their lives. It's too hard. Social security should deliver a measure of dignity to people, and a capacity to rebuild their lives and get into work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Australians in tough positions, facing $40 a day, Newstart makes their lives worse. Single parents who have been shifted off the single-parent benefit—the result, I have to say, of a decision by a previous government—are in a terrible position. They face the declining ability to pay for household expenses; the prospect of homelessness; insecurity; big challenges like finding shoes to put on their children's feet and finding clothes for them to go to school. Then there is the terrible stress that that presents to those families: no jobs, no support, $40 a day. It's a much tougher row to hoe for people in rural and regional Australia, who, apparently, some people on the other side still care about: $40 a day, no hope, no dignity, no job.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:36</span>):  The eradication of poverty should be the highest moral imperative of all of us in this place. When people go hungry, when kids have no place to sleep at night, when folks are trapped under systems and processes which place them in danger, in fear, they should be able to look to this place and know that, while the lights are on in this building, there are people working to help. And yet, for 24 long years, on the issue of Newstart, the very opposite has been the case. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have wasted decade after decade in this place ignoring the voices of folks living in poverty and ignoring the experts that work in the social policy space. In that time, we have allowed a great crisis to develop in Australia's communities: the crisis of entrenched intergenerational poverty, with folks trapped in a daily struggle that nobody in this place can picture or even imagine. It has been within our power all of these years to do something about it, and yet we have failed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk a little bit tonight about what sits at the heart of that failure, because it's something that disabled people experience really acutely. What sits at the heart of this failure is a belief that, if you live in poverty, it is because of your own moral failing—that poverty is a result of your own failure to be a good person, your failure to 'have a go and get a go', as that sentient bag of flour in the other place so eruditely puts it. This ideology, this vicious belief that poverty is the result of a personal failing, is something which we disabled people suffer acutely. There are 200,000 of us that are living on Newstart right now, and we are first to suffer at the hands of this idea that says, 'Oh, you're just making it up.' We must be. We're faking a bad back, we're putting it on with a walking-stick, we're faking our mental ill health because we want to be on social welfare! We want to be on the DSP! We want to be on Newstart! If only somebody took the rod out of the cupboard and were willing to give us a hard enough kick, we'd be able to find ourselves a job somewhere! The result of that thought process is that 50 per cent of disabled people in Australia live below the poverty line. We live below the poverty line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a national disgrace that inaction in the face of poverty has become government policy in this country. It is given moral and ethical sanction every day in this place by the repetition of those tired and empty slogans that we hear from the government in this place every single day. There will come a day when this chamber finally moves to act on this issue and at that moment we collectively will owe an apology to all those who we failed during these last 24 years and who suffered as a result. We must now take this opportunity to move on this issue, to do the right thing and to ensure that no Australian is trapped within a system that is letting them down and driving them further into destitution and poverty. I thank the chamber for its time.</span>

                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />The committee is a technical scrutiny committee which examines and reports to the Parliament on the compatibility of bills and legislative instruments with Australia's international human rights obligations, in accordance with its legislative mandate under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011.</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As usual, this report contains a credible technical examination of legislation with Australia's obligations under international human rights law. Of the bills and instruments examined in this report, a number have been restored to the notice paper or reintroduced in relevantly substantially similar terms to those previously reported on. In these cases, the committee has taken the approach of reiterating its views as set out in its previous reports, including in relation to a number of bills scheduled for debate this week. Additionally, 61 bills have been assessed in this report as not raising human rights concerns.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As part of its role, the committee seeks to explore questions of human rights compatibility through dialogue with relevant ministers and officials to identify and explore questions of human rights compatibility. To this end, in this report the committee is seeking further information in relation to two new pieces of legislation, including the Fisheries Management Regulations 2019. By authorising the collection and disclosure of identifying personal information, these regulations engage a number of human rights, including the right to privacy. There is also a question whether the instrument may permit the disclosure of information overseas, including to foreign governments in circumstances where there may be a risk that a person may be subject to the death penalty or to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. This risk was not addressed in the statement of compatibility. Accordingly, the committee has sought further advice from the minister as to the human rights compatibility of the regulations.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having reviewed its past practices, the committee has resolved to take a stronger, more targeted approach to its work, to ensure effective parliamentary oversight and control of delegated legislation. This includes using the disallowance process to highlight and prosecute the committee's more significant scrutiny concerns. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the current monitor, the committee seeks to draw the Senate's particular attention to two instruments. The committee has sought advice from the relevant minister in relation to each of these instruments on two occasions. Despite the advice of the ministers, the committee continues to hold significant scrutiny concerns. The committee's views on these matters are supported by independent, expert legal advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first instrument is the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Regulations 2018. This instrument sets out principles which the minister must observe when deciding whether to direct that a non-citizen child is to become the minister's ward. It specifies, for example, that a direction must not be given unless it is necessary to protect the child from 'moral danger', to give the child the benefit of adequate direction and guidance, or for any other reasons that the minister, or their delegate, considers to be in the interests of the child. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee considers that these are significant matters with the potential to affect the personal rights and liberties of non-citizen children. Consequently, it is the committee's view that these matters should be included in an act of parliament, rather than left to delegated legislation or non-statutory policy guidelines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second instrument is the Water Amendment (Murray-Darling Basin Agreement—Basin Salinity Management) Regulations 2018. The instrument appears to incorporate external documents as in force from time to time, without the legal authority to incorporate documents in that manner. Consequently, the committee has serious scrutiny concerns that the instrument does not accord with the legal requirements for making delegated legislation. Once again, the committee's views are supported by independent, expert legal advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has resolved to place notices of motions to disallow these instruments, to emphasise the committee's concerns and to give the Senate additional time to consider these matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With these comments, I commend the committee's Delegated Legislation Monitor 4 of 2019 to the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Question agreed to.</span>

              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">This statement does not mean that the Full Cycle Docking will be moving interstate. It simply means that planning for how to develop the most efficient construction yard for the future submarines should not exclude the land currently used by ASC.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 'completed strategic review'—take note of those words. That strategic review was allocated $7 million in the budget and was designed to assist officials towards 'integrating capabilities, reducing duplication and maximising efficiencies'. It was earlier this month that we learnt that the Minister for Home Affairs had no intent of ever making that review public. And, rightly so, the Senate unanimously supported a motion on Monday to order Minister Dutton to provide us with a copy of the completed strategic review.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight, the Senate and the Australian people have had that order thrown back in our faces.

                    </a>  Senator McKim says it's probably the latter; I'm inclined to agree. In fact, the release of this document states: 'There was no single consolidated report prepared as part of the strategic review process.' Well, what was produced by the strategic review then? What was $5 million of Australians' money spent on? Listen to this clanger of a sentence featured on this $5 million piece of paper: 'Collectively, the outputs of the strategic review provide the corpus of knowledge that the portfolio employs to establish, govern and prioritise its budget arrangements.' The 'corpus of knowledge'—that's what our $5 million paid for. That's $5 million worth of bureaucratic buzz words right there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The community has a right to know how one of our largest government departments and one that is so fundamental to our national security is being administered. Luckily for the Australian people, Mr Dutton hasn't always been able to dodge the scrutiny as he's attempting to do today. Since the amalgamation of the home affairs department there have been a number of reports by the Australian National Audit Office on its operations and performance, and their findings can only be described as scathing. It seems that every single time someone gets a peek behind the curtain they don't like what they see going on in the Department of Home Affairs. This is a department riddled with inefficiencies, waste and maladministration, all at the hands of the Minister for Home Affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Take the ANAO's June 2018 report into the initial merger of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection with the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and the establishment of the Australian Border Force. This process was described by the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, as:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the most significant reform of Australia's national intelligence and domestic security arrangements in more than 40 years</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You would rightly imagine that overseeing this process would be a high priority for the minister who was ultimately in charge of it. Shockingly, the ANAO found that there was:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… no evidence identified to indicate that written briefings were provided to the minister on progress throughout the implementation process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the minister didn't get any written briefings from the department on what Prime Minister Turnbull called the most significant reform of Australia's national and domestic security arrangements. No wonder we have only a single piece of paper and just a corpus of knowledge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In December 2018 the ANAO reported on the department's Cape-class patrol boats, the front line of our border protection. They found that the boats had consistently fallen short of their patrol-days targets since 2014. This was before we learnt, in December 2018, that the department was forced to ration fuel and reduce patrols because of Minister Dutton's $300 million cut to the department's operating budget. The department doesn't have a good track record of responsible spending either. We know that the department spent over $450,000 on corporate hospitality and a further $100,000 on executive office upgrades in the 2017-18 financial year alone. We also know that they spent $132,000 on motivational speakers—obviously not motivating them enough to produce an actual report—and gave $9 million to Toll Group to build accommodation on Manus Island, a project that was abandoned and never completed but apparently still paid in full.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This all pales in comparison with the department's ongoing decision to use limited or closed tenders to procure services on Manus Island and Nauru. On at least six occasions the department gave a total of nearly $1.2 billion worth of contracts to companies without proper scrutiny. This includes the $423 million they gave to a company called Paladin, which was registered to a beach shack on Kangaroo Island and which the minister claimed he had 'no sight over'. In another report, from January this year, the ANAO found that the department's biometric identification services project was 'deficient in almost every respect' and that, while the total expenditure on this project was $34 million, 'none of the project's milestones or deliverables were met'. No wonder they couldn't produce a report. It would be too embarrassing for them to produce it publicly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most recently, in February, we learnt just how poorly our citizenship process was being handled by the department. The ANAO found:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Processing times have increased and long delays are evident between applications being lodged and decisions being taken on whether or not to confer citizenship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Significant periods of inactivity are evident for both complex and non-complex applications accepted by the department for processing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And: 'The department is not checking the quality of the decisions taken.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As of 30 June 2018, there were more than a quarter of a million applications for citizenship by conferral, by descent or through adoption that had not yet been processed by the department. At the end of September last year nearly 200,000 people in Australia were on bridging visas, over 85,000 more than when the Liberals and Nationals came to government in September 2013. The ANAO are currently in the process of completing three more reports—and, unlike the government, I bet they publish them—related to the department and have publicly flagged a number of potential performance reports in the future. Minister Dutton has consistently met the ANAO's criticism with a combination of denial and apathy. It's no wonder the department is struggling when the minister in charge can't handle any degree of criticism or scrutiny. He shies away from transparency, because whenever someone shines a light on his department his incompetency and apathy are revealed for all to see.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's effort is this $5 million piece of paper—by the way, they didn't even manage to fill the whole page. They allocated $7 million to them in the budget. They didn't run out of money; they just ran out of words. They couldn't even fill a whole page. This piece of paper cost $5 million. This is just another example of the contempt that Minister Dutton shows anyone who attempts to hold him to the standards expected of a government minister. When will Minister Dutton finally be held to account for his ongoing incompetence? Why would his own colleagues in this place, who voted for this order for the production of documents, accept this farcical response?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a multimillion dollar review, paid for by the Australian taxpayer, implemented to try and identify and fix the endemic issues inside one of the most significant and largest single government departments. This is vacuous, expensive and wasteful. This report should have been voluntarily released by the minister to reassure the community that the department in charge of Australia's national security, border protection and immigration is capable of doing those things. The only reason he has to reject the will of the Senate, and particularly the will of his own colleagues who voted for this, is that he has something very significant to hide about the management of his department.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will continue to hold the minister to account, to scrutinise his work, because it is what the Australian people deserve. We will call on Minister Dutton to release the completed version of the strategic review, the corpus of knowledge—whatever name he wants to put on it—and allow the public to see exactly how he is running his department.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="JKM" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  Senator Keneally and I have some disagreements on policy matters in the purview of the Department of Home Affairs, but I will place on the record that I agreed with every single word that she said in her recent contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this wasn't so serious it would be an absolute joke. The money that this department wastes beggars belief. This massive department—probably one of the biggest administrative consolidations of power in Australia's history—basically could not organise a beer in a brewery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian National Audit Office has regularly, consistently and significantly criticised this department for its incapacity to manage basic administrative functions. Whether you are talking about outrageous delays in visa processing, whether you are talking about its propensity to torture refuges on Manus Island and Nauru or its regular and consistent failures to adhere to government purchasing guidelines—all of which, I might add, have been the subject of significant criticism from independent statutory authorities ranging from the Australian National Audit Office through to the Human Rights Commission—this department has consistently failed to deliver value for money for the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish I could say that I was surprised at the farce that this Senate has been presented with this evening, but I am anything but surprised. This is absolutely par for the course from the Department of Home Affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a department that has a tame minister, who is predisposed to accede to all of this government's organisational desire to control and surveil every single aspect of the lives of Australian people. And the fact that they have this tame minister, and a tame Prime Minister—who used to be the minister responsible for various parts of what is now the Department of Home Affairs—is leading Australia down a very dangerous path. We have a secretary of the department who believes Australians are like innocent hobbits who need to be protected from the dark forces at work in the world, and who is not prepared to contemplate that actually some Australians, me included, value our freedoms more highly than we value the mirage of absolute safety that this minister, and this secretary, are attempting to sell us, the Australian people. They are marching us down the dark and dangerous road to a police state and a surveillance state, and they are doing so in the most inefficient and draconian way imaginable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This farce that the Senate has been presented with stands as a symbol of the farce that this department has become. And the best stroke of an administrative pen that could be wielded in Australia today is to smash up this department—to de-consolidate the Department of Home Affairs, to spread the power out. Because power that is concentrated and power that is unaccountable—and both of those criticisms apply to the Department of Home Affairs—is the most dangerous kind of power that there is. The consolidation of power bringing, for example, ASIO into the home affairs department, was a sad day for this country. It was a sad day for democracy. And every time this department takes the next step down the road to a police state, every time this department continues to erode fundamental rights, freedoms, and liberties in this country—rights, freedoms and liberties that we used to send Australians overseas to fight wars to defend—and every time this department takes another step down that road, it is the Australian people who are losing something precious. They are losing their freedoms. They are losing their privacy. They are losing their capacity to go about their day-to-day lives without the all-seeing eyes of the government spying on them. And I use that term advisedly: the government is spying on Australians with the draconian laws that this department continually recommends up to its minister, who continually takes them to cabinet, who continually brings them into this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not good enough. It needs to be called out, and I'll tell you why it needs to be called out, Acting Deputy President Faruqi: because if you want to fight something, you have to call it out. If you want to call something out, you've got to name it. So I'm going to continue to be a member of the very small and selective group of senators in this place who have used the f-word: fascism. I've used it repeatedly, and I will say it again today. Don't believe that the slow frogmarch to fascism cannot happen in Australia—anyone who believes that is not a student of human history. Fascist regimes rise because people do not fight for their rights. And I am here to fight for the rights of ordinary Australians, and to insist that we have an informed debate in this country about this erosion of rights and freedoms, and about how we balance the perfectly reasonable desire to be safe in this country with that erosion of rights and freedoms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia remains the only liberal democracy in the world that does not have some form of charter or bill of rights to protect and enshrine our rights. And yet the Australian Greens are the only party in this parliament that has a policy that Australia should have a charter or a bill of rights. And the reason we need a charter or a bill of rights in this country is so that citizens have got the tools that they need to stand up against this march down the road to a police state. We will campaign through this parliament and, I predict, beyond—because we won't get a charter of rights in this parliament, because neither of the major parties support those protections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll campaign in this parliament, we'll campaign in the next parliament and we'll keep campaigning until, finally, Australia loses that tag of the only liberal democracy in the world that doesn't have a charter or bill of rights, either legislatively enshrined or constitutionally embedded. A charter of rights should be in the Constitution in Australia. I acknowledge constitutional change is very difficult in this country and basically relies on broad political agreement in this place and in the public debate to succeed. But there is no reason we should not have a legislated charter of rights, and that is what I commit the Australian Greens to continue fighting for. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are presented with this farce today, a farce that has cost millions of taxpayer dollars. I think about this every time I hear a government minister stand up now and say, 'Oh, no, we cannot increase the Newstart payment because we are making choices and we are setting budget priorities.' This government that just smashed up the progressive tax system in Australia, to give away $158 billion in tax cuts, can't find within its collective heart the relatively miniscule amount of money it would take to deliver a $75 a week increase in Newstart. Those are your priorities, and you stand condemned for those priorities. Yes, budgets are all about priorities, but when you're throwing away millions of dollars in a completely useless review, you stand condemned for your warped priorities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will extend the sunset date of the ASIO's questioning and detention powers in Division 3 of Part III of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 for 12 months until 7 September 2020. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will enable the government adequate time to progress legislative reforms to ASIO's questioning and detention framework in light of the PJCIS and INSLM reviews, while ensuring that ASIO will continue to have access to these important tools in its efforts to gather critical intelligence to enhance Australia's counter-terrorism efforts. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By way of conclusion, I would note that this bill ensures security agencies continue to have the capabilities to deal with the changing national security and threat environment while also protecting individual rights, including through transparency and oversight measures. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PJCIS and INSLM have comprehensively examined ASIO's compulsory questioning and detention powers and I acknowledge and appreciate the extensive and continuing work of the PJCIS and INSLM. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I also appreciate the ongoing partnership with states and territories in our joint effort to keep the Australian community safe. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">To this end, this government is unwavering in its commitment to ensuring Australia's counter-terrorism and national security framework continues to be as robust and responsive as possible. </span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will amend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Competition and Consumer Act 2010</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Privacy Act</span> 1988, and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010</span> to introduce a Consumer Data Right and Open Banking. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Today is another major step in Australia's data revolution. With this Bill, Australia becomes a world leader in implementing an economy-wide right for consumers to access and use data that businesses hold about them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This important reform will provide individuals and businesses with a right to access data relating to them; and to authorise secure access to their data by accredited data recipients. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It will also enable data about products on offer to be available in machine readable form.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Consumer Data Right is a right for consumers to authorise data sharing and use. Consumers will determine which data is shared under the Right, on what terms and with whom. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Consumer Data Right is a game changer for consumers and small businesses. It will enable consumers to better harness their data for their own benefit. The Consumer Data Right is a fundamental structural reform that will drive competition and improve the flow of information around the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And the Right will incentivise Australian entrepreneurs to develop new products and applications that reach more consumers and are better tailored to their needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For consumers, improved access to data will support better price comparison services, taking into account their unique circumstances, and promote more convenient switching between products and providers. It will also leverage new technology such as artificial intelligence and allow consumers to make more informed decisions on where they spend their money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For small and medium businesses, it will allow for more effective budgeting tools that can deal with data in real time and help them manage their cash flow and working capital more effectively than they can do today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Improved access to data will also enable the development of new, better and more convenient products and services, many customised to individuals' needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We live in a world of increasing complexity. Many consumers need assistance in understanding the choices open to them and how best to navigate the sheer volume of choices presented to them – choices that may not be presented in a way that allows them to make effective comparisons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, the recent Productivity Commission review on <span style="font-style:italic;">Competition in the Australian Financial System</span> reported that the average Australian household could be saving up to $1000 per year on their home loan if they switched to another lender – but many do not. With over 4,000 different residential property loans on offer, it is no wonder that customers struggle to determine which home loan is best for them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Consumer Data Right provides efficient and convenient access to accurate information and empowers third parties to develop tools that will allow consumers to make the most of the choices available to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These tools are likely to include comparison sites that take into account the actual ways the consumer uses the product; budgeting apps that analyse actual spending behaviours; and services that assess the expected return for a household that is considering the installation of roof-top solar panels taking into account their actual electricity usage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By doing so, the Consumer Data Right will increase competition and drive consumer focussed innovation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill lays the tracks for Australia's future data economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Consumer Data right will support data-driven innovation across the economy. New high value jobs will be created by positioning Australia at the global forefront of data access and innovation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In introducing this Bill today, we are implementing commitments made by the Government in its response to its <span style="font-style:italic;">Review into Open Banking</span><span style="font-style:italic;">in Australia </span>and to the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Productivity Commission</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s Data Availability and Use Inquiry</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has committed to applying the Consumer Data Right to banking – where it is referred to as Open Banking, then to the energy and telecommunications sectors, and in due course more widely across the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill establishes a broader framework that can apply across all sectors to ensure that the data can be transferred in a safe and secure way, while retaining the flexibility to recognise that data access arrangements must be able to adapt to different sectors, different data sets, different risks, different customers needs and changing technologies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill allows for the growth and evolution of the Consumer Data Right by allowing new data sets to be added over time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When deciding whether to add new sectors or data sets as being subject to the Consumer Data Right, the Minister will be required to seek the public advice of both the ACCC and Information Commissioner. The Minister must consider a range of factors prior to adding a sector, including the impact on consumers, competition, data-driven innovation, privacy and confidentiality, and whether the data may contain intellectual property.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also creates a rules and technical standards framework that recognises the need to allow for flexibility in implementation over time as technology adapts, and between sectors that have different risks and differing levels of technological capability. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Nevertheless, implementation between sectors should be as consistent and interoperable as possible. Consistency and interoperability will facilitate the growth of a vibrant data ecosystem and ensure consumers are able to navigate easily the emerging data economy as active participants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Strong privacy and information security provisions are a fundamental design feature of the Consumer Data Right. These protections include Privacy Safeguards and additional privacy protections through the consumer data rules. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner will advise on and enforce privacy protections, and provide complaint handling for breaches of the Privacy Safeguards. Consumers will have a range of avenues to seek remedies for breaches of their privacy or confidentiality including access to internal and external dispute resolution and direct rights of action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Only trusted and accredited third parties will be able to access data from data holders at the customer's direction. Accreditation can be considered to be a 'data safety licence'. Accreditation will contribute to the justified confidence that consumers can have that the system supports safety and security for their data.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ACCC will be responsible for advising what sectors should be added, writing rules, accrediting new participants, and enforcing serious and systemic breaches of consumers' rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Complementing the rules, technical standards turn what is a right in principle into real action. The Data Standards Chair, advised by the Data Standards Body, will be responsible for working with businesses, consumers, and innovators to ensure that the right is implemented in a way that promotes efficiency, convenience and safety. Consistent standards will support access to data that is usable and reduce the barriers to service providers offering new services to consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also contains a statutory review provision, with a review to be completed by </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">1 July 2022. This review will provide an opportunity for the government to confirm that the system is operating as intended; and to consider the impacts of the system on consumers and industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to thank the active and ongoing engagement by industry, consumer and privacy groups, and FinTechs in the development of this Bill. I also thank them for their ongoing engagement in the Productivity Commission's inquiry and the Open Banking Review and in the development of rules by the ACCC and standards by Data61.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will provide all Australians with a new right to access their data and use it in a way that they have never been able to do before. We live at a time of unparalleled technological advances. The Consumer Data Right will allow Australia to fully leverage these advances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Royal Commissions Amendment (Private Sessions) Bill 2019 enables the private sessions regime in Part 4 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Royal Commissions Act 1902 </span>to be applied to other Royal Commissions. The private sessions regime was inserted into the Act <span style="font-style:italic;">in </span>2013 to support the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Private sessions allowed that Commission to hear from survivors and victims about their experience of abuse in a private and supportive setting. Participation was voluntary. The Commission heard over 8,000 personal stories in private sessions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The final Royal Commission report attests to the courage of survivors who came forward to share their experiences, and to the important contribution private sessions made to the Commission's inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For some survivors, telling their story in a private session was the first time in their life they had told someone about their abuse. For others, it was the first time they had been heard by someone in a position of authority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">One survivor told the Royal Commission: 'After 50 years I finally feel I've been heard. "People have listened to me before, but no one has really heard me'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The substantial work of that Commission is well documented. The Government is committed to ensuring it comprehensively and appropriately responds to that work. This includes the National Apology delivered by the Prime Minister in this Parliament, on behalf of all Australians, to the victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Chair of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, the Honourable Richard Tracey AM RFD QC, and the Chair of the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability, the Honourable Ronald Sackville AO QC, have told the Government that private sessions will assist their important inquiries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These are challenging and confronting Royal Commissions. They are tasked with identifying what should be done to improve the quality and safety of aged care services in Australia, and what should be done to prevent violence and abuse against Australians with disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Subject to passage of this Bill, it is the Government's intention to recommend These inquiries will help identify how systems can be strengthened to prevent, and respond to, this conduct in the future. Like the Child Sexual Abuse Royal Commission, both inquiries are engaging with people about their experiences of mistreatment or abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">to the Governor-General that both the Aged Care Royal Commission and the Disability Royal Commission are able to use private sessions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Private sessions are just one way that Royal Commissions can gather sensitive and personal information from individuals. Their use can have implications for the constitution of a Royal Commission as well as funding implications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For that reason, the Bill proposes that private sessions are enabled through a regulation. That mechanism will require a discrete decision on whether private sessions will be useful for a particular inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill largely preserves the framework for private sessions used for the Child Sexual Abuse Royal Commission. However, some changes are proposed to supplement the way that a Commission gathers information and to give more flexibility to a Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Limitations on the use and disclosure of information given at a private session will be retained. Sessions are conducted in private and are not open to the public. Private session information can only be used in a report if de-identified, or if the information is also given in evidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Others limitations include a secrecy offence and a provision that overrides other laws that compel production of records, for example subpoenas. Information can be disclosed with the consent of the individual who gave the information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Private session records are also excluded from the operation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Information Act 1982, </span>and are treated in the same way as census records under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Archives Act 1983. </span>That means these records will not become publicly available until 99 years after the year the record was created. These limitations on use and disclosure are designed so that people are not discouraged from sharing their personal stories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, as private session information is not given on oath or affirmation, these provisions also serve to protect the privacy and reputations of other individuals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In practice, Commissioners and members of the staff of a Royal Commission need to engage with individuals before, and after, their private session. Before a private session, a Royal Commission may need to gather preliminary information about the individual's story, so that the attending Commissioners or Assistant Commissioners are familiar with the person's situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">After a private session, it may be appropriate for a Royal Commission to contact the participant to discuss any concerns arising from the private session and to offer counselling or support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To achieve consistent protections, it is proposed to apply existing limitations on use and disclosure of information obtained at a private session to this kind of information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For some, attending a private session to talk about mistreatment or abuse they have experienced may be re-traumatising. It is proposed that the protections will apply whether or not the private session is ultimately held.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the model used by the Child Sexual Abuse Royal Commission, only a Commissioner could hold a private session. Under this Bill, private sessions must be held by a Commissioner unless the Chair, or sole Commissioner, considers there are circumstances that justify authorising Assistant Commissioners to hold private sessions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Assistant Commissioners must be appropriately qualified and senior staff members to be authorised to hold private sessions. These individuals would be authorised by the Chair of a multi-member Commission, or if an inquiry is constituted by a single Commissioner, that Commissioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This provision is to give more flexibility to a Commission. It may enable more sessions to be held, particularly in the case of a Royal Commission that is constituted by one or two Commissioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Royal Commissions are the highest level of public inquiry and reserved for matters of significant public importance. The private session framework can be a very important format to supplement the way that a Commission gathers information to complete its reporting obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill delivers on the Government's commitment to ensure and in some cases restore, integrity to registered organisations and their officers to make sure that they work in their members' best interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unions and employer associations hold a privileged position in the national industrial relations system and the economy more broadly. However, we have seen some organisations and their officers continuously abuse these privileges, engage in repeated unlawful behaviour, and fail to act in the best interests of their members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As has been repeatedly observed by members of our nation's judiciary, some officers and organisations have proven wholly incapable of addressing their unlawful behaviour. They have nothing but contempt for the law, perversely treating court ordered penalties as the cost of doing business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Aside from the obvious undesirability of repeated lawbreaking, this sort of conduct also manifests in costly delays to key infrastructure projects like schools, roads and hospitals. Frankly, taxpayers deserve better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Sadly, since the Royal Commission, this sort of behaviour has not stopped in The 2015 Trade Union Royal Commission heard countless examples of officers breaching their duties, engaging in blackmail, extortion, coercion and secondary boycott conduct, abusing their right of entry privileges, acting in contempt of court and failing to prevent their organisations from repeatedly breaking the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">some organisations, with the courts continuing to make numerous findings and levying countless penalties against organisations and their officers who continue to flout the rule of law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In March of this year we saw the courts penalise the CFMMEU and its officers for pressuring a worker into joining the union and giving up their hard-earned wages in fees for an organisation they didn't want to join in the first place, effectively working for nothing. According to the CFMMEU, `that's just the way it is'. It most certainly should not be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As recently as last month the CFMMEU and its officers faced another fine of over $100,000 for unlawful entries and threats on construction sites. That decision saw them top $4 million worth of court ordered penalties for the 2018/19 financial year alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In fact the CFMMEU's behaviour has been so poor for so long, that in 2017, one Federal Court judge, described them as 'the most recidivist corporate offender in Australian history'. It seems like little has changed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is why the Government is committed to passing this vital legislation, which will take a significant step towards curbing the behaviour we have seen threaten the rule of the law in Australian workplaces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will strengthen the powers of the courts to disqualify officers of registered organisations from standing for or holding office where they flout the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also make it an offence to act as an officer or shadow officer while disqualified. This is a sensible change consistent with the treatment of directors disqualified from running corporations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Those individuals convicted of serious criminal offences such as blackmail, extortion, or threatening to cause serious harm to public officials should not hold office in a registered organisation. The Bill therefore includes serious criminal offences punishable by five or more years' imprisonment as a new category of prescribed offence, which leads to automatic disqualification of the officer. This reflects provisions in the Corporations Act which also provide for the automatic disqualification of company directors where they are convicted of certain serious forms of misconduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill introduces new and streamlined cancellation grounds to deal with organisations or parts of organisations that do not comply with the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Where appropriate, these grounds reflect the powers in the Corporations Act for the court to wind up a business, including where its directors have acted in their own interests, or otherwise unfairly or unjustly towards members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Where the unlawful behaviour is contained to one part of an organisation, instead of cancellation, the Court will be empowered to make alternative orders specific to that particular branch or division without affecting other parts of the organisation that are functioning effectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also make it easier for the Court to appoint an administrator, where the organisation or a part of the organisation has ceased to function effectively, the officers of an organisation engage in financial misconduct, or the organisation fails to act in the best interests of its members. This is not unlike the administration powers that apply to a company that is dysfunctional or otherwise in financial difficulty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill also introduces a new public interest test that must be satisfied before registered organisations can merge. The Fair Work Commission will consider the likely impact of the merger and an organisation's record of compliance with the law as well as other matters of public interest. Parties with sufficient interest will also have the opportunity to voice their opinions about the proposed merger. Before corporations are able to merge, they must satisfy the regulator that the merger would not</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">substantially lessen competition or is otherwise in the public interest. It is appropriate that registered organisations must do the same.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These reforms are critical to stop the law-breaking by some registered organisations and improve the ability of the Court to remove long-term repeat offenders from holding positions of office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In re-introducing this Bill, the Government has listened to stakeholders to ensure that its provisions more closely align as far as practicable, the standards for registered organisations and their officers with those that apply to companies and their directors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill strikes the appropriate balance between ensuring that registered organisations and their officers act with integrity and obey the law, without affecting the vast majority of organisations and their officers that do the right thing and work hard to represent their members and act in their best interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All parties in this Parliament who believe in the rule of law should support these reforms.</span>

As we discussed earlier this morning, there are times when the complication of the process will mean that they are not always going to be able to meet those time lines, but they're certainly the kinds of time lines we've been meeting in the past and we'll be seeking to meet in the future.</span>

However, because it's potentially a simpler process for the financial aspects as opposed to the wellbeing, it may be possible for it to be shorter. I wouldn't want to give an undertaking to this chamber until we've gone through a few of the processes, but we certainly would be seeking for it to be no longer than the current wellbeing process.</span>

One of the things that we would be seeking to do is, obviously, expedite the process in cases where it's very simple, so we wouldn't like to give the applicant the view that it's going to take six or eight weeks when in fact it may be a much shorter time frame. But I'll take on notice the intent of your question in relation to providing applicants with some sort of indicative idea of how long the process may be expected to take.</span>

I appreciate the answers to my questions that I received from the minister. However, we still remain very concerned about the broadness of the criteria and the way they may be interpreted. We believe that the process should focus on the participants' capacity to manage their finances, which is clearly something that is able to be documented, whereas many of those other criteria aren't. I commend the amendment to the Senate.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I don't know all of the speakers who will be on at CPAC, I'm proud to be sharing the stage with some people of enormous calibre: former Prime Minister John Anderson, who I deeply respect; Jacinta Nampijinpa Price; and Janet Albrechtsen. They're just a few names in a long list of very credible people. It's action packed, and, I confess, I don't know everyone, but I look forward to meeting them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jacinta has advised me that her talk will centre around her experiences of being an Indigenous conservative in a politically correct world. Warren Mundine will be talking about reform in Indigenous affairs. Both Jacinta and Warren have valid viewpoints on their topics, and I respect them both deeply. But again, it's hardly the stuff of tear gas and rubber bullets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to respond to the insinuation from Senator Keneally that I endorse the comments made by Raheem Kassam. They're not comments I'd ever make, and nor do I endorse them. They're crass, and they're stupid for a grown man to make, but, let's be clear, they're not dangerous. I'm told he has apologised for them. Regardless, they're wrong. Had Mr Kassam threatened the safety of someone, I might be as alarmed as Senator Keneally, but, to call for him to be banned from this country for being an idiot—well, we'd never see an English football or cricket supporter ever enter this country again. Through you, Acting Deputy President Senator Faruqi, does Senator Keneally feel her opinions are so soft, her world view so fragile, that she could not withstand or argue against opinions with which she does not agree?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's an elitist attitude that there is never any wrong in the Labor Party. We all know Senator Keneally started her career in New South Wales in the Labor Party prior to entering the Senate. Senator Keneally sat in the same party room as Eddie Obeid and Ian Macdonald, both of whom we know went to prison for their corruption, and Joe Tripodi too. Indeed, she wouldn't have ever been a leader without her good old mate Eddie. She is a member of the branch of the Labor Party which produced Luke Foley. He lost the leadership over being a bit inappropriately handsy with an ABC journalist. Could the senator express her views on that particular incident? After all, she was Foley's boss for a while there. Senator Keneally also sat in the same party room as Mr Daley, who made remarks shortly before the NSW election this year which <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span> labelled as racist. They said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Let's not tiptoe—Daley's comment that "our young children" were being "replaced by young people from typically Asia with PhDs" was racist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Does Senator Keneally now not attend functions when these people are present? Does she avoid Labor conferences when she knows they'll be there? Did Senator Keneally ever condemn the two local councils of Marrickville and Leichhardt for their anti-Semitic, anti-Israel stances? Did Senator Keneally ever ask Joe Tripodi about his treatment of women, in particular the one that accused him of sexually assaulting her in his office in the year 2000? Did she ever apply the same standard to members of her own party, the people who endorsed her as a senator, that she is now applying to Raheem Kassam? Will she be delivering similarly impassioned, self-righteous speeches about them in the chamber? I won't hold my breath. Senator Keneally has had, in her career, many opportunities to hold her party to a higher standard, and she has failed time after time after time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As for my attendance at CPAC, I won't be asking Senator Keneally for permission to attend this forum. If we're doing our job properly as politicians, we should be talking to people from all walks of life, every day, and of course we won't agree with them all the time. That's exactly how it should be. I'm sure Senator Keneally doesn't endorse what he said. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt that she'd never give me. But to try and shame me into not attending a conference of many educated and thoughtful individuals— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="ING" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLAGHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  I rise tonight to make a short contribution on an important anniversary, which is the 30-year anniversary of the first woman elected to lead a government in Australia, and that was Rosemary Follett, here in the ACT. She was elected the first Chief Minister of the ACT in 1989, at the beginning of ACT self-government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to being elected Chief Minister, Rosemary was the member for Fraser in the ACT House of Assembly, which preceded self-government, and she had also become the president of ACT Labor in 1987. It's hard for me, having been a chief minister following Rosemary, to understand or get my head around exactly how difficult being in that inaugural territory parliament, in the election in 1989, would have been. People who haven't followed territory politics closely might not be aware that self-government was rejected by the ACT community, the people of the ACT; they had wanted to remain under the administration of the Commonwealth. So there were a whole range of competing pressures. One was a community that didn't want self-government. Another was that significant cuts had to be made by the incoming ACT government to deal with cuts by the Commonwealth that had transferred with the election. Along with that, there were only five Labor members, I think, in the first parliament, and four Liberal members. There were a range of anti-self-government parties—in fact, there were representatives from the Abolish Self-Government Coalition and the No Self-Government Party. The ballot paper, the whole election, had been very, very difficult, I think.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rosemary reflected, on the weekend when we had the anniversary celebration, that, walking into the chamber that first day, it wasn't clear to her if she was walking in to become Chief Minister, opposition leader or, indeed, a member of the crossbench, depending on how the vote flowed—because the assembly is the chamber that elects the Chief Minister after the election of the Speaker, and so it's done by secret ballot. To this day, she maintains she doesn't know how she got nine of the 17 votes. But she did become the first female head of government in Australia, the first Chief Minister of the ACT. There were a lot of firsts for Rosemary. She's very humble about the contribution she made to politics, but I know as someone who lived in the ACT who wasn't a member of the party, certainly, Rosemary being the first and being such a strong role model encouraged women like me to get involved in politics and to stay in politics. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rosemary also had to deal with a minority government, which isn't easy, in a very turbulent time. The Labor government she led was short-lived and was removed by a motion of no confidence by the ACT assembly, but she returned in 1991 and then led Labor to election victory in 1992. Labor lost the following election, but Rosemary remained in the assembly until 1996. There were many measures she put in place as Chief Minister—important changes in a very new ACT government, with an ACT public service that hadn't existed before. She had a very reluctant public service. Many of the people who came to the ACT public service were people forced to leave the Commonwealth Public Service, so they weren't happy to be there. There were no laws; the first parliament had to create the statute book. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenges before Rosemary were many, and she spoke about this at the 30th anniversary event. She spoke from the heart, I think, as she reflected on the words she used during that first election campaign, and when she was newly elected, and how she has remained true to those words. I think that's a very important lesson for all of us in politics, particularly those that stay around a long time: to stay true to the things that originally drove us. Rosemary led the way for many women, not just here in the ACT but across the country, and her public service continued after politics. I have to say, the second female Chief Minister, Kate Carnell, was very sharp, and offered Rosemary a job outside the parliament, which she took, and worked in the public service for the public, as she always has. We thank her very much for the work she did. To Rosemary: we thank you for your service.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  Following on from Senator Gallagher's contribution, I would like to pay tribute to Rosemary Follett and the contribution that she's made to politics, not just in the ACT but around the Commonwealth of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I'm on my feet, I'd also like to reflect briefly on what was a weak and, essentially, incoherent defence of the indefensible from Senator Stoker. She said about the CPAC conference that she didn't know who was coming but she looked forward to meeting them. Well, we know quite a bit about who is coming, and I'm quite worried that Senator Stoker looks forward to meeting them. What they have to contribute to Australian conservative politics is beyond me. It's not crass; it's misogynistic and violent. One of them is a Holocaust denier. Obfuscation by weak comparisons is no defence, and I think that Senator Stoker should reflect overnight on whether or not she's defending the indefensible—and not get into the corner and try to fight her way out, but reflect on whether it's actually the right thing for the Australian people, to be encouraging racism and violence and ultra-right politics. There's a more colloquial expression that I won't use in this chamber, but I do think that you're judged by the company that you keep.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise this evening really to indicate my support for—and I think that the Senate should also support—the thousands of members of the Health Services Union of New South Wales who are going on strike tomorrow to attend a four-hour stop-work meeting, because of concerns about safety in public hospitals. It's not a wage dispute, although they've got every right to be angry about their wages. It's not a dispute about their hours or about staffing levels in public hospitals, although they've got every right to be angry about those issues. They are on strike because public hospitals in New South Wales have never been more dangerous: more dangerous for staff, and more dangerous for the community who use them. The HSU has had members stabbed and shot, and the safety of patients, staff and visitors is constantly put at risk. The response from the New South Wales government, of course, is to hold another review, after a previous review in 2016 that made no progress with the deep-seated safety issues that they face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Public hospitals should be safe places—safe for staff and safe for patients. The HSU has a plan. It has a legitimate set of grievances. It is a tough thing to do. It is a brave thing to do, to go on strike to go to a stop-work meeting. It's something that the New South Wales government has been actively opposing. It is, I would add, something that in the Commonwealth public sector is not lawful, and I think that's a real problem with our democracy. But I want to congratulate those thousands of members of the Health Services Union who are taking a stand for public health, public hospitals and safety.</span>

Grandparent carers are those taking primary responsibility for raising their grandchildren. There are many reasons why children could be living with their grandparents, including the death of a parent, parental drug or alcohol abuse, mental health issues, incarceration and family violence. Very often children experience, in fact, an intersection of all of these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to recognise the vital role that grandparents play in providing a safe and loving environment when raising their grandchildren. Without them, there would be thousands of children stuck in out-of-home care, removed from links to their family. Grandparent care is the fastest growing form of out-of-home care for children in this country. As at January 2018, half of all children in relative or kinship placements were living with their grandparents. Recent research out of my home state of Western Australia shows that grandparent carers are predominantly single older women living on low incomes and raising, on average, three grandchildren.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Grandparent carers face unique challenges in their role as carers, and these challenges require a specialised approach. I have received many letters from grandparent carers living in Western Australia. Their letters describe the financial stress they experience, the lack of legal security, personal health issues and their difficulties meeting the complex care needs of often traumatised grandchildren. Several of my constituents spoke of the significant financial stress they faced caring for their grandchildren, especially whilst struggling to get by on income support payments.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from the emerging research that children have significantly better outcomes in kinship care compared to those in foster care. It is critical that we find ways to support grandparent carers to continue in their roles. One way that we could better support grandparent carers is by ensuring that they are exempt from participating in the activity requirements attached to Newstart and related payments. Regardless of whether they have a court order or not—and that's a significant problem for those who don't actually have a court order, despite caring for their grandchildren—grandparents are already going above and beyond to raise their grandchildren. They shouldn't be subject to harsh mutual obligations and threatened with having their income support payments cut.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, service providers and the broader social security system often don't acknowledge the role of grandparents. This is further complicated if there is an absence of any legal recognition of the caring arrangement, which often there is not. Grandparents usually don't have access to the same financial assistance and income support payments available to foster carers. It is critical that the government fixes this two-tier system to ensure that all grandparents raising their grandchildren are able to access adequate financial assistance and essential services, including Centrelink and Medicare. This is not just a state issue. Please, Commonwealth government, don't just fob it off to the states. The Commonwealth is responsible for some of the key issues, such as those around Centrelink and Medicare.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Grandparent carers understandably find it difficult to navigate service and payment systems. I strongly support a review into the number, geographical location and allocation of Centrelink grandparent advisers to ensure that needs are being met in high-demand service areas and in rural and regional Australia. Grandparent carers provide significant social and economic benefit to the wider community, often at the detriment of their own health, finances and relationships. We have recently formed, in this place, the Parliamentary Friends of Grandparents Raising Grandchildren. Through this group, I look forward to working with stakeholders and my parliamentary colleagues to work on and promote issues important to grandparent carers across this nation.</span>
