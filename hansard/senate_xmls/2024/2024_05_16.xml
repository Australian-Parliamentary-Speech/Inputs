                  <span class="HPS-Small">Compliance with the mandatory reporting criteria remains patchy … the quality of reporting … remains poor … many companies are still not identifying obvious modern slavery risks in their supply chains or taking meaningful action to address them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor McMillan said, in his final report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A widely endorsed view in the consultations for this review is that there is no hard evidence that the Modern Slavery Act … has yet caused meaningful change for people living in conditions of modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, temporary migrants are also particularly vulnerable to modern slavery. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has pointed out that the drivers of exploitation include insecurity due to temporary visa status and visa arrangements that tie workers to their employers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the Senate Select Committee on Job Security in the last parliament, I heard firsthand from temporary migrants who had been subjected to slavery or slavery-like conditions. Kate, an agricultural worker from Taiwan, told us about how she took a job picking oranges for $25 per bucket. When she arrived on the farm, she was told that a bucket is 800 kilograms worth of oranges. She said, 'There's no room for negotiation.' She went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I was very afraid of getting issues when I needed to renew my visa. I was afraid that reporting my condition and making a complaint to the government would risk my new visa application.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also heard from a number of workers from Vanuatu and Samoa, who courageously told us about their exploitation on farms in Victoria and Queensland. They were earning as little as $2.50 an hour while living in slum conditions leased to them by the labour hire company at an exorbitant rate. These workers were people such are Sergio, a Vanuatuan man. He'd come here to pick grapes. He told us, 'I came here to work for money. I did not come here as a slave.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we heard from highly respected Australian missionaries Geoff and Jane Smith, who are charity workers in Bundaberg. Their home was subject to a dawn raid by nine Australian Border Force troopers because they were suspected of aiding migrant workers who had fled from slave-like conditions. As Jane told the inquiry, 'I was in bed asleep and I heard a shuffle past my bedroom window. Next minute, I get up and all these police are in my house and they said, "We've come here to raid your house."' At the same time, the former Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Dutton—now the opposition leader—was plastering farming regions with posters warning workers that if they absconded they would be deported and bring shame on their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While Mr Dutton was threatening these workers with deportation, 45 workers on the Pacific Labour Mobility Scheme died at work, many of whom had visas tied directly to their employer, meaning they had no way of leaving an unsafe or deadly work environment. That's the system of those opposite—a protection racket for the very worst employers in our country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very serious matter we're considering today. We've already made urgent changes to our workplace laws to make it illegal for businesses to threaten their employees on the basis of their visa status. We've amended migration laws to introduce new visa protections for migrants exploited at work. We've decriminalised undocumented work by migrant workers and established criminal offences for employers who exploit workers. Where Mr Dutton threatened people escaping slavery with deportation and shame, we are making it safer and easier for people to come forward. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill and the review of the Modern Slavery Act are in addition to the changes we have already made to our workplace and migration laws. The McMillan review of the act made 30 recommendations, which the government is in the process of responding to. Several of the recommendations relate to the Anti-Slavery Commissioner, which the bill establishes. The commissioner will have functions, including to engage and support victims and survivors of modern slavery, to promote compliance with the Modern Slavery Act and to support businesses to address risks of modern slavery practices in their operations and supply chains. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been calling for an antislavery commissioner since 2017, so this is an important step forward. It should be viewed in the context of the work that is being done, and is ongoing, in the review of the act and in migration and workplace laws more generally. It's also clear that more needs to be done. As a broad range of groups have noted, the existing Modern Slavery Act has failed. As the ACTU said in its submission to the review of the act:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the primary measure of the impact of the MSA must be whether it is working to eliminate modern slavery … On this measure, it is clear the MSA is not succeeding. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The 'transparency framework' approach of the MSA is not an effective strategy for addressing modern slavery. It is based on the flawed assumption that reporting alone will improve business practices—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and as they—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Oh, my God, that's out of date, isn't it?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Leaving things up to the market to take care of has rarely, if ever, actually worked. What a ludicrous way to approach a serious issue—where the slave owners and those profiteering from slavery are actually going to turn around and self-regulate. What a novel approach. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A review by the Human Rights Law Centre, the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, Baptist World Aid, the UNSW Human Rights Institute, the University of Western Australia and the University of Notre Dame looked at how this transparency framework was working. They reviewed the modern slavery statements of 102 companies in high-risk sectors, including companies supplying garments sourced from China, rubber gloves sourced from Malaysia, seafood from Thailand and horticulture in Australia, and found that less than half actually identified and disclosed modern slavery risks. For example, three in four companies sourcing garments from China failed to mention the risk of Uighur forced labour in their supply chains. That is an extraordinary failure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even taking ASX 200 companies, who should be best placed and resourced to enact the previous government's approach, a 2021 review found that a third of ASX 200 companies' modern slavery statements were noncompliant with the act. How's that for market forces when even the highest profile public companies in the country are thumbing the nose? If a third of the biggest public companies in Australia aren't compliant, what hope do we have for everyone else? It's clear that the act is not being taken seriously in the absence of real legal obligations, real penalties for noncompliance and real enforcement mechanisms. But that was the whole point of the previous government's approach to modern slavery: to give the appearance of taking it seriously while allowing slavers to profiteer. That's why the McMillan review called for the establishment of due diligence obligations for businesses and for penalties for noncompliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to the Attorney-General's response to this review, noting his long-held concerns about the inadequacy of the act as it is currently drafted. I also note that a wide range of stakeholders and submissions on the bill call for the commissioner to also be equipped with investigative and enforcement powers. As the Human Rights Law Centre said in its submission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it is critical that the Commissioner be empowered to help monitor and enforce compliance with the Act … receive and handle complaints and undertake investigations regarding suspected instances of modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The McMillan review also recommended new powers to support compliance with the act, and this should also be considered as part of the government's response. I note that the government's amendments to this bill, arriving from the Senate inquiry, clarify that the commissioner is able to refer matters for investigation to relevant agencies, including law enforcement agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to express disappointment at the views expressed by some business groups on the review of the Modern Slavery Act. Slavery exists at the extreme end of the spectrum of workplace exploitation. This government has made sweeping, substantial changes to grow wages, improve job security and eliminate exploitation at work. At every juncture, groups like the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry have opposed those reforms. The chamber of commerce made similar comments to the modern slavery review, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Significant cultural change is needed … to recognise this as an issue for many businesses … Forced efforts will drive forced behaviours …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… a more compliance driven approach will drive compliance based, blinkered approaches …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a bit of a clanger, isn't it? The chamber of commerce is telling victims of slavery that they should just wait and hope that businesses will do the right thing. I think it's time to hold businesses to account for slavery in their supply chains, and this bill is an important step forward.</span>

This is not just a question of business being expected to address, especially, offshore modern slavery. There are real practical issues in terms of business considering these issues and taking steps. The best approach is a team approach between government and business. In response to Senator Sheldon's comments, I want to read from a paper from the NSW Anti-slavery Commissioner, Dr James Cockayne, who gave some extremely good evidence to our inquiry in relation to modern antislavery measures. He spoke about the People's Republic of China's response in relation to Western companies trying to deal with the issue of modern slavery within Xinjiang. This is how the People's Republic of China has responded, in the words of Dr James Cockayne:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Western efforts to call out human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and to regulate supply-chains passing through Xinjiang, have been met by a furious backlash from Beijing, with many components: a full-court media and diplomatic push, describing the allegation as the "lie of the century"; the adoption of an Anti-Sanctions Law that criminalizes—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just reflect on this: 'criminalises'—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the People's Republic of China has introduced a law which would criminalise a company based in the People's Republic of China cooperating with a Western company, a company in Australia or a company in the United States, trying to carry out due diligence in relation to supply chains.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the practical issues facing Australian businesses when they are seeking to undertake due diligence with respect to modern slavery issues in Xinjiang within the People's Republic of China. These are real issues. This is not just a question of business being held to account, as it should be held to account, with respect to this issue. It needs support from government, because there is very strong pushback from certain international players who don't like it when companies outside their jurisdiction undertake due diligence with respect to these issues. So this issue needs to be considered in that context. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly I would like to sincerely acknowledge the work of the Attorney-General's Department with respect to this legislation. I think the effort that they've put into the legislation and also their cooperation with the inquiry was first class. The staff of the department should be complimented on that. I would also like to thank all the witnesses, especially from non-government organisations, who participated in the inquiry, including Dr James Cockayne, the New South Wales Anti-slavery Commissioner, who gave very good evidence. Also I want to acknowledge victims-survivors of modern slavery, who need to be kept at the centre of these reforms. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very pleased that the government has adopted amendments to this legislation. I genuinely believe it improves the legislation and I commend the government for introducing amendments to the legislation. I will speak in relation to one of those amendments shortly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's record with respect to anti modern slavery measures should be considered, especially given the comments of Senator Sheldon. It was a coalition government that first introduced slavery offences into Australia's Criminal Code in 1999. It was a coalition government that in 2018 passed Australia's Modern Slavery Act. We are building on that act today through this legislation. It was a coalition government that first introduced the Modern Slavery Act which is being amended today. That needs to be recognised as well. That act shone a bright light on slavery risks in international supply chains. Lastly, it was a coalition government that developed the national action plan to combat human trafficking and slavery from 2015 to 2019 and the subsequent plan between 2020 and 2025. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want an international perspective with respect to the quality of our laws in this space compared with those of our international partners, you can do no better than refer to the comments of Mr Hyland, who gave evidence to our inquiry. He was the first modern antislavery commissioner in the world, appointed under the government of the United Kingdom. This is what he said about our laws: 'Currently, Australia is leading in creating transparency of modern slavery in supply chains.' So we're coming from a pretty strong base, a pretty strong foundation, which builds on the work of both sides of politics, and I think that should be generally recognised. For me, this is not a partisan issue. This should be dealt with on a non-partisan basis because I think we're all interested in making sure that people aren't the victims of modern slavery within our borders or outside of our borders.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Hyland's comments were provided in response to a question on notice I put to him with respect to my deep concern about the definition of 'sensitive information' in the bill and how that would operate to potentially prevent the modern Anti-Slavery Commissioner from being able to discuss issues of great importance with respect to modern slavery in international jurisdictions. The concern there was that the original definition talked about the modern Anti-Slavery Commissioner not being able to include in the annual report or the strategic plan anything which 'would or might prejudice international relations'. I was deeply concerned that the operation of that definition would mean that issues such as those occurring in Xinjiang could simply not be included in an annual report or a strategic plan due to the pushback from the People's Republic of China. However, an amendment has been made to that definition of 'sensitive information'. It is a very good amendment, and I'm very pleased that that amendment has been made because I think it genuinely enhances the legislation.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's in that context that we're dealing with the issue of modern slavery in overseas jurisdictions, where some of those jurisdictions push back hard and, as Dr James Cockayne said, use things such as media, diplomacy and an anti-sanctions law adopted in the People's Republic of China that 'criminalises cooperation with foreign supply chain due diligence'. Dealing with this issue requires moral courage on the part of not only businesses but also government, and it requires cooperation between business and government. Business cannot be expected to deal with these issues alone, especially when dealing with certain overseas jurisdictions. They require the support of government, which is one of the reasons why I'm very pleased with the amendments which are being made to this legislation. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I want to return to one of the introductory points I made, and that is that victims-survivors of modern slavery must be kept central in our consideration of these matters. They must be at the centre of everything we do in this place in relation to these issues. When we're considering legislation in this space, we need to consider how the legislation will impact on victims-survivors. Again, there are some very pleasing amendments which are being made to the bill in that regard, including requiring the commissioner to engage with victims of modern slavery to 'inform and support' them with respect to the performance of the functions and including a principal objective in the strategic plan which sets out the objectives of the Anti-Slavery Commissioner to make 'guidance material publicly available to support victims of modern slavery'. That is welcome. It's about keeping the victims-survivors of modern slavery at the centre of our consideration of these matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In continuing that theme, I want to end my contribution—I probably should have started and ended my contribution with this, but at least I'll end with it—by paying tribute to one of those victims-survivors, Mr Moe Turaga, who actually appeared before the committee and gave evidence to the committee. He is a survivor and now a consultant in relation to these matters. After being a victim-survivor, he has now become an advocate, helping other people in this situation, and also a consultant. He appeared with the Australian Catholic Anti-Slavery Network, and I compliment them on their work in this space. I want to end my contribution with his words, the words of a victim-survivor:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My strongest advice is for an explicit commitment in the bill to put survivors and our concerns at the centre of the commissioner's work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe the amendments made to the bill do that, and I would like to sincerely thank Mr Moe Turaga for his advocacy, for his testimony and for all the work he does in the space. Similarly, I compliment various outstanding non-government organisations on all the work they are also doing in this space to try our best to eliminate modern slavery in Australia's supply chains. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:28</span>):  I rise on behalf of the Greens to indicate we will be supporting the Modern Slavery Amendment (Australian Anti-Slavery Commissioner) Bill 2023, but, in doing so, we seek to amend and improve it in order to rise to the challenge that is modern slavery. I want to acknowledge the comments of previous speakers, and I particularly want to acknowledge the significant work of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee—the chair, deputy chair Senator Scarr and other members of that committee—in discussing with stakeholders the necessary improvements to the bill and looking at the significant gaps in the legislation as proposed, because the question that this bill and the inquiry that we had were meant to answer was this: what would it take to make laws that actually stop Australia and Australians participating in modern slavery, and not just in Australia but in increasingly global supply chains?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report of the committee addresses a number of significant issues that stakeholders raised, and, while the recommendations that come from that are useful, they are modest. They've been included now in a series of amendments that the government is proposing to the bill to improve the system, but they didn't include a number of critical measures that were raised by stakeholders to make this bill actually rise to the challenge of trying to stamp out modern slavery in this country and around the world. For example, the bill does not provide the Anti-Slavery Commissioner with genuine independence by permitting them, when they're appointed, to provide advice and reporting directly to both the minister and parliament, and the bill does not provide for a multipartisan, joint oversight committee. They are elements you would include if you wanted a genuinely independent and empowered Anti-Slavery Commissioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill as initially drafted does not ensure that the Anti-Slavery Commissioner's work is informed by and led by the experience of victims-survivors, and it doesn't have a statutory reference and support panel. There are very modest amendments being proposed by the government, but they go nowhere near providing the kind of reference point and grounding in the experience of victims-survivors that, for example, the New South Wales legislation provides. It's inexplicable to the Greens why the government isn't willing to entrench those kinds of provisions more firmly in the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation does not provide the Anti-Slavery Commissioner with the strong compliance powers needed to monitor and enforce compliance by corporate Australia and, indeed, require the Commonwealth to lodge full and complete modern slavery statements, and it's inexplicable why it doesn't. We've heard the evidence from the inquiry that significant elements of corporate Australia treat the provision of modern slavery statements as a tick-and-flick exercise because they know that there's no stick. There's no compliance stick if they fail to do their reporting or if they do it in a way that is derisory. Why not give the Anti-Slavery Commissioner the power to enforce compliance?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think one of the issues that is going to arise from day one of the establishment of this office is that it will not meet the expectations of victims and survivors that the Anti-Slavery Commissioner will be able to seriously help them—that the commissioner will, first of all, have sufficient investigative powers to inquire into matters when a victim-survivor comes forward and says, 'I was the victim of modern slavery,' either the victim perhaps of an exploitative industry in Australia—and it does happen—or, as we've seen on multiple occasions, the victim of an exploitative industry in a foreign country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill gives the Anti-Slavery Commissioner no power to even do preliminary investigations to understand the likelihood and the veracity of those complaints in order to inform industry and government as to how to respond, let alone to identify other victims-survivors who they could reach out to and help. They have no investigative powers. Stakeholders and the Greens don't believe the Anti-Slavery Commissioner's investigative powers should replicate the functions of police, but they should allow the Anti-Slavery Commissioner to respond to complaints of modern slavery, to do adequate investigations and to refer matters off where needed. What we get from the government is that there will be memorandums of understanding. They are not investigative powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stakeholders also made it clear that the Anti-Slavery Commissioner's proposed existing functions—even the very modest existing functions—cannot be adequately exercised with the proposed $2 million annual budget. And it wasn't just one stakeholder who said that; it was every single engaged stakeholder—every single one of them. Yet we look again in this year's budget, and that's what we see for the Anti-Slavery Commissioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By way of perspective, the evidence before the committee was that this is a budget that's significantly less than is provided to the New South Wales Anti-Slavery Commissioner. Of course, the federal office will have a far greater remit than that important state equivalent. How can the government pass legislation and say that they're doing generational reform and seriously addressing modern slavery when they're establishing a federal regulator which has a fraction of the budget of its state equivalent and when much of this is going to be involved with assessing Australia's international trade connections? How can the Albanese Labor government seriously say that they're committed to addressing modern slavery when they are giving the federal regulator a fraction of what the state equivalent is being provided with?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that, following the work of the committee—and I particularly want to acknowledge the work of Senator Scarr in this regard—there are useful recommendations designed to deal with the narrowing of the definition of sensitive information that will be withheld, and, as I said, there are some modest but useful recommendations to require the commissioner to respond to those with lived experience, though they are well below the standard set by the New South Wales example. The reason I'm familiar with the New South Wales example is that I was a member of the parliament and of the two committees that reviewed the New South Wales legislation. It was initially a private member's bill that was moved in New South Wales, which was agreed to by the then government, but then the then government refused to implement it. It took a further two years of arm wrestling and wrangling with opposition from parts of corporate Australia to finally get the New South Wales legislation up and running and implemented. Every step of the way there was corporate resistance and, indeed, political resistance. It is a terrible missed opportunity for this federal legislation to not even meet the standards of the existing New South Wales legislation—to fall below that on critical elements. A lack of investigative powers, a lack of engagement with those of lived experience and a lack of funding stand out as highlights for what a tepid response this is from the Albanese Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be clear, for the Anti-Slavery Commissioner to be able to deliver on the public mandate that will inevitably travel with that position, it needs to be able to take an active role in the identification and penalisation of modern slavery, and there's none of that in this bill. Having a body that provides victim-survivors with brochures on where they can go to seek justice or assistance, and otherwise just reviews and comments on government and corporate modern slavery statements, does not deliver on the promise that was made by the Albanese government first when it was in opposition and now that it's in government. To be clear, the Anti-Slavery Commissioner needs the backing of a commission to be able to undertake the full scope of expected work. There is no question that a standalone commissioner with a budget of around $2 million a year will be unable to discharge the duties required, even under this scheme, as the ACTU made clear during the public inquiry. It said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We're also concerned about the small budget that the commissioner is being provided with—just $8 million over four years and $2 million a year ongoing. We're proposing that it be increased to enable it to effectively carry out its standard functions and be sufficient to deal with the scale and severity of the scourge of modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr James Cockayne, the New South Wales Anti-slavery Commissioner, told the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On the second question of whether there is a role for the New South Wales parliament's Modern Slavery Committee to discuss resourcing, yes, there is, and I do speak with them about that. I've raised on the record with them several times that my own budgetary allocation, which is currently out of the Department of Communities and Justice's own resources and which I note is larger than $2 million, which raises its own questions of why a federal commissioner would have a smaller allocation than an individual state. I believe that the allocation I receive is inadequate to allow me effectively to discharge my statutory functions at the New South Wales level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a bucketload of this compelling evidence that leads to only one conclusion: the proposed budget for the federal Anti-Slavery Commissioner is manifestly inadequate. There should be an independent budget process and an adequate budget to ensure that the commissioner receives the funding that it needs. That would best be done if it were overseen by a joint parliamentary committee that reflected the make-up of this whole parliament, not one dominated by the government, which have indicated from day one that they want to strangle this office of the funding that's needed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On enforcement powers, there are real concerns that, if the commissioner does not have sufficient powers to directly levy penalties, then it will be essentially toothless. As a minimum, there should be penalties available for the failure of government agencies or corporate Australia to meet the reporting requirements on modern slavery. The Anti-Slavery Commissioner should also have the necessary power to compel the production of documents, records and other evidence where the Anti-Slavery Commissioner has reasonable grounds to expect there has been such a failure. But, for reasons that are not explained other than by saying,  'Computer says no,' none of those powers have been given to the modern slavery commissioner. It would be a serious mistake on the part of the Albanese government to create this position and then limit it in large part to referring victims and survivors of modern slavery off to other agencies and otherwise just writing letters and reports identifying modern slavery. This model will fail to deliver on the mandate for the commissioner, and we will inevitably have to come back and significantly reform it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the question of investigative powers, the Human Rights Law Centre told the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… in our view, the commissioner should not merely be a first point of contact; they should also be able to initiate their own investigations and inquiries. In order to promote compliance with the act, for example, the commissioner will need to be able to investigate companies that they believe to be providing misleading statements under the act. The office may also need to investigate particular high-risk sectors with a view to exposing bad systemic practices in order to better inform efforts to address modern slavery. These functions would not be intended to duplicate or interfere with investigations into individual suspected cases of modern slavery that may be more appropriately undertaken by law enforcement. The focus of the Modern Slavery Act is not on criminal investigations and enforcement but rather on driving changes in corporate behaviour in order to prevent modern slavery from happening in the first place.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I endorse those comments of the Human Rights Law Centre, but, unfortunately, those powers are not found in the bill. Carolyn Kitto from Be Slavery Free spoke to the committee, and I want to acknowledge her and Fuzz's work and their bravery over years and years. They said about the need for a fully-resourced and empowered antislavery commissioner:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So why do we need one? In 2018 we boasted that we were leading the world in our actions on modern slavery, and we were. We can no longer make that claim. It is one thing to have good legislation; it is another thing to actually decide that you're going to put in place the things that make that legislation actionable and enforceable, and that's what an antislavery commissioner would do. We need one to provide business, government, civil society and victims-survivors opportunities to work together.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To understand the scale of this challenge and why Australia must move faster, I think it's appropriate to end with the words of Walk Free, who advised the committee:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Global Slavery Index estimates the prevalence of modern slavery at the country level around the world. The 2023 index said the global number was 50 million, which is an increase of 10 million since we did the last estimate five years ago, and in Australia that number is 41,000 for people living in modern slavery. That includes people living in forced labour and people living in forced marriage. That number has gone up from 15,000 five years ago, I believe, which I think was 2016.</span>

                    <a href="e5x" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:43</span>):  I rise to speak in favour of the Modern Slavery Amendment (Australian Anti-Slavery Commissioner) Bill 2023. Can I say from the outset that I concurred with so of what Senator Scarr said during his contribution to this debate. It is a bipartisan solution, and we need that support to pass this legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In times past, slavery was a simple concept to define: one person or group of people owning another person or group of people and subsequently forcing them to complete unfair labour tasks. Unfortunately, modern slavery is far more complex. In Australia, a person or a group of people are luckily no longer able to legally own another person or group of people. However, forced labour, sexual exploitation, child slavery, forced criminality, domestic servitude, forced marriage, organ harvesting and human trafficking are all elements of the newer concept of modern slavery. All these things are a horrible reality of our society here in Australia. Modern slavery practices are a major violation of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Australia is a party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Modern slavery practices are serious crimes that have become more and more prevalent globally and are complex, always evolving and often hidden from the limelight by the perpetrators so they're not caught. We want to change that for the better. We know organised crime is also in this space. In 2019, Australian Institute of Criminology research found that there were between 1,300 and 1,900 victims of human trafficking and slavery in Australia between 2015-16 and 2016-17. Furthermore, this research project of the Australian Institute of Criminology also found that, for every detected case of modern slavery practices being carried out, there were four additional cases that remained undetected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian businesses are also not safe from modern slavery. They are regularly exposed to modern slavery risks, and some goods and services available in our free market here in Australia are likely—very likely—to be tainted by modern slavery practices, whether it be forced labour, forced criminality or the like. While the establishment of the Modern Slavery Act 2018 is a good and progressive addition in combating the scourge of modern slavery, the Albanese Labor government recognises that more can be done, especially that more can be done to address the estimates that modern slavery crimes continue to increase here in Australia and abroad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For a long time, civil society, businesses, industry and academia have advocated the establishment of an independent commissioner who can raise awareness on the issue of modern slavery here in Australia. These stakeholders have advocated a commissioner who can provide independent information and support to victims and survivors and targeted support to businesses to identify and address modern slavery risks in their supply chain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2017, reports from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Hidden in plain sight</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>and <span style="font-style:italic;">An inquiry into human trafficking, slavery and slavery-like practice</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span> respectively, both explored and made recommendations for the Australian modern slavery laws that would establish an independent commissioner, which the Albanese Labor government joins in recommending.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The establishment of this bill builds on the Modern Slavery Act 2018, which I spoke about earlier, and delivers on the Albanese Labor government's tackling modern slavery commitment at the 2022 federal election by way of an amendment to the Modern Slavery Act 2018. This election commitment is all about further strengthening Australia's response to modern slavery and heightening our commitment to upholding the absolute right to freedom from slavery and forced labour and ensuring the right to protect against exploitation, violence and abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, the commissioner will be required to consider Australia's international commitments when performing their functions to ensure that implementations of Australia's human rights and trade obligations are appropriately respected and, importantly, upheld. The commissioner will be financially accountable to the Commonwealth and will provide an annual report on the outcomes of their work program, to be tabled in the parliament upon their completion. The commissioner will develop a strategic plan detailing their priorities, which is to be published on their website.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After all, it is about public awareness, and the best way to achieve that is through the commissioner. But I would like to, at this point in my contribution, acknowledge those community organisations and not-for-profits that have been working in our communities with survivors. The work that they have done has helped bring us to where we are now. The contributions to both of those committees that I referred to, from those who made submissions and came before those inquiries to give evidence, has helped shape where we are now. Going through the 2022 federal election, Labor made a commitment and, once again, we're delivering on that commitment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, though, going back to the commissioner, their responsibility would be to uphold Australia's public governance and privacy laws when performing their functions to protect individuals' and Australia's interests. The bill provides that the commissioner will be appointed through a strictly transparent and merit based process and will be appointed on a full-time basis for a term as long as five years. The commissioner can be reappointed once after their term expires. Having a two-term appointment and that process of making sure that we continue to renew the commissioner will help to continue to raise that awareness and to bring focus on the priorities during that period of time. It's always good to have fresh eyes and a fresh commissioner, in my view. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commissioner will work collaboratively with government agencies to support existing initiatives while progressing new, complementary initiatives to address and combat modern slavery. Wherever there is organised crime involved in activities, as we know only too well, the criminals are always coming up with new strategies and new ways of trying to go undetected and under the radar. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Inquiries and reports can also be forwarded from the commissioner to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for consideration. Further functions may be considered for the commissioner as necessary following the Albanese Labor government's response to the review. This bill will also support the Albanese Labor government's budget 2023-24 announcement on 9 May last year, which provided that $8 million over four years will be allocated for the establishment of the Australian Anti-Slavery Commissioner. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Modern slavery is a confronting, disturbing and prevalent issue in our society and our country and beyond our borders. I have provided you with some facts about the logistics and strategy surrounding the establishment of the Australian Anti-Slavery Commissioner. As has been commented by others in this place, in the speech from Senator Scarr I heard that this is a bipartisan issue. There is nothing partisan about this bill at all. So I feel confident that we will have the support. It's not a bill to try to make political points. It's about putting amendments forward that are going to make this legislation better legislation. It's in all our interests to do that. It's an incredibly important bill, and I urge those around the chamber to support this bill so we can move forward and get the first appointment of the new Anti-Slavery Commissioner. </span>

She was sent to a place 300 kilometres from home, where she was forced to sell cakes around the local village, even if she was ill. Sophea was given nothing to eat unless she sold all the cakes, and she was beaten every day. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the death of her parents, at age nine, Sinet was sent to live in an orphanage, together with her brothers and sisters. Children at the orphanage were forced to work in the rice fields and to entertain foreign tourists by singing and playing games with them. While the tourists would sometimes buy the children clothes or food, these were seized by the director of the orphanage and sold at the local market. Sinet was subjected to horrific physical and sexual abuse by the director of the orphanage. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moceica was approached by his cousin, a church minister, to go to Australia to study and earn money. When he arrived his passport was seized and he was told he had to pay off a debt for travel and visa costs. He worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week, picking grapes, watermelons or lettuces. Moceica thought that the money from his labour was being sent to his family, but when he contacted his mother after two years he found that they had received none of it. He estimates that these traffickers made over $200,000 from exploiting his labour, and he still has scars on his back from falling onto barbed wire, for which he received no medical treatment.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just a few of the horrifying stories reported in the 2017 Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inquiry into modern slavery titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Hidden </span><span style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">n </span><span style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span style="font-style:italic;">lain </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ight</span>. Modern slavery practices are among the worst human rights abuses and are widespread throughout the world. They take many forms, including forced marriage, child exploitation, human trafficking, serfdom or servitude, forced labour and even slavery as it is known in the traditional sense. It is estimated that globally around 50 million people are subject to human trafficking and modern slavery. That is a staggering number, especially when you consider, for comparison, that it is more than three times the number of people who were enslaved during the entire three centuries of the transatlantic slave trade. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Modern slavery takes place in every country in the world—sadly, including Australia. According to the Office of the NSW Anti-slavery Commissioner, there are 300 cases of modern slavery reported in Australia each year. But these cases are just the tip of the iceberg. The Australian Institute of Criminology estimated that between 2015-16 and 2016-17 there were between 1,300 and 1,900 victims of human trafficking and slavery in Australia and that, for every victim detected, about four victims go undetected. International human rights group Walk Free puts the figure even higher, estimating that in 2021 there were 41,000 people living in modern slavery in Australia. These include people in forced marriages, including children, and also forced labourers, particularly in those industries with a high proportion of migrant workers, such as agriculture, construction, domestic work, meat processing, cleaning, hospitality and food services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's responsibility to tackle modern slavery doesn't just stop at our borders. There are many products being imported to Australia that have been produced with forced labour. We have a moral obligation not just to tackle modern slavery within our country but also to be part of the international effort to address the problem globally. The Modern Slavery Act has increased transparency in supply chains and elevated awareness among the Australian business community of modern slavery risks. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I recognise that it was the previous government that introduced the Modern Slavery Act, in 2018, Labor in opposition did a great deal of the legwork in the years prior to develop a serious policy to tackle modern slavery. In doing so, we had numerous discussions with representatives of business, civil society and trade unions, and the act was brought about only after considerable pressure from Labor. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While passing the Modern Slavery Act into law was a step in the right direction, there is much, much more that needs to be done. The establishment of an Anti-Slavery Commissioner was part of Labor's tackling modern slavery election commitment. In the 2023 budget we committed $8 million over four years to establish the commissioner, who will work across government, business and civil society to tackle modern slavery. Among the functions of the commissioner will be engaging and supporting victims and survivors of modern slavery, promoting compliance with the Modern Slavery Act and providing targeted support to business to address risks of modern slavery practices in their operations and supply chains. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commissioner will be an independent statutory office holder, and this independence will be vital for the commissioner's ability to engage with stakeholders and develop effective policy and practice to address modern slavery. The commissioner will be accountable to the parliament and will be required to establish a strategic plan outlining their priorities. Annual reports tabled in parliament will inform the parliament and the public of the commissioner's activities and their progress towards strategic outcomes. The commissioner will be appointed through a merit based and transparent selection process on a full-time basis for a term of up to five years, and the commissioner may be reappointed once after their initial term. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this bill is passed, the commissioner will not, on their own, constitute the Australian government's entire response to modern slavery. Rather, their office will be part of a comprehensive framework that includes the Modern Slavery Act criminal offences, specialist Australian Federal Police investigative teams, a support program for victims-survivors, a human trafficking visa framework and a modern slavery research program. The commissioner's functions will complement the work being undertaken to combat modern slavery by the Attorney-General's Department, other government agencies and the Ambassador to Counter Modern Slavery, People Smuggling and Human Trafficking. The establishment of the commissioner will add to our arsenal for combating the horrific practice of modern slavery, both at home and abroad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An independent antislavery commissioner has widespread support from stakeholders across civil society, trade unions, peak business groups and academics. It has also been recommended by several inquiries and reports. The 2017 <span style="font-style:italic;">H</span><span style="font-style:italic;">idden in plain sight</span> report, which I mentioned earlier, found that the establishment of an independent antislavery commissioner in Australia would 'strengthen Australia's response to combating modern slavery'. Also in 2017, the report of the Joint Committee on Law Enforcement's inquiry into human trafficking, slavery and slavery-like practices stated: 'There may be merits in establishing an anti-slavery and trafficking commissioner independent from government.' The five-year statutory review of the Modern Slavery Act led by Professor John McMillan AO in May 2023 noted the Albanese government's commitment to establishing an antislavery commissioner, and observed:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are high expectations that the Anti-Slavery Commissioner will play a pivotal role in lifting both recognition within Australia of modern slavery risks and the standard of business performance in addressing those risks …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The McMillan report also noted that, with only a few exceptions, there was strong support for an antislavery commissioner in submissions to the inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most recent inquiry that considered the merits and role of an antislavery commissioner was, of course, the inquiry into this bill. While the report focused on the key issues raised by the provisions of the bill, there was strong support for a commissioner in the submissions to the inquiry. The Australian Human Rights Commission said in its submission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Government's decision to legislate an Anti-Slavery Commissioner is a welcome step towards further strengthening Australia's response to modern slavery. With an effective mandate, institutional independence and appropriate resourcing, the Anti-Slavery Commissioner will make an important contribution towards both combatting modern slavery and protecting human rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">International human rights organisation Walk Free said in its submission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We believe the establishment of an Anti-Slavery Commissioner is crucial to monitor and support government and business to strengthen the prevention and remediation of modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that some submitters, including Walk Free, the AHRC, the Maritime Union of Australia and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, submitted that the commissioner should have a greater remit than that proposed in the bill. However, as the Attorney-General's Department noted in its submission to the inquiry, the office of the commissioner is being established with a view to considering further functions as necessary. For example, the government is still giving careful consideration to the recommendations of the McMillan review, and further functions may be considered for the commissioner as necessary, following the government's response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By further strengthening Australia's response to modern slavery, this bill demonstrates Australia's heightened commitment to upholding the absolute right to freedom from slavery and forced labour and the right to protection against exploitation, violence and abuse. The Albanese Labor government remains firmly committed to tackling modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="266524" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  As a servant to the fine people of Queensland and Australia, I note that the Modern Slavery Act 2018 establishes the Australian Anti-Slavery Commissioner as an independent statutory officeholder within the Attorney-General's Department. The role of this new commissioner is to bring together the different initiatives the government has taken since the Modern Slavery Act was enacted. These include a unit inside the Attorney-General's Department and other agencies, including Border Force, to monitor the existing antislavery legislation, and an ambassador to counter modern slavery, people smuggling and human trafficking. The Modern Slavery Amendment (Australian Anti-Slavery Commissioner) Bill 2023 clarifies the commissioner's ability to share information with the Australian Federal Police and other law officers. That will be useful where slavery is brought to light.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The definition of 'slavery' in the Modern Slavery Act, which the commissioner will be relying upon for their actions, is wide enough to include what everyday Australians would consider slavery. There is an issue with the definition of 'child slavery' that I will return to in a moment. Noting the absence of penalties in this bill and the modern slavery bill, I hope the commissioner does receive the level of cooperation necessary to eliminate slavery in the supply chains of corporations doing business in our country and of course eliminate slavery as it exists in Australia, which is mostly sex slavery. Senator Shoebridge has advanced an amendment which should improve cooperation with the commissioner. One Nation will support the amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commissioner will provide an independent mechanism for victims and survivors and business and civil society to engage on issues and strategies to address modern slavery. This is the area of the bill that was dialled up following the committee report. There seems to be a strong emphasis on telling the stories of those workers who are being exploited and preparing material to inform business and the public on the issue. While One Nation will be supporting this bill, I believe that Australians across our country consider slavery repugnant, and the best option is to proceed to criminal and economic sanctions right now for businesses that include slavery in their supply chains. Deal with it now and stop slavery now. Businesses have had more than three years to establish whether or not they have slavery in their supply chains. That should be plenty of time. Simply reporting on it—and self-reporting at that!—is not an effective solution. That approach is nearing its use-by date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation looks forward to the commissioner stepping this up and clearly communicating sanctions to business and working with the Attorney-General and the Minister for Trade and Tourism on further sanctions and penalties. It's essential that an Australian consumer can buy goods or services in our country and be safe in the knowledge that they are not rewarding the use of slavery. It's useful for people who see something to have somewhere to say something. For that reason I look forward to the commissioner operating a telephone and web function that allows people to report suspicions they have around the use of, or the keeping of, slaves. That could be used for reports of child slavery and child labour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For all the talk about child labour, we still have children in the Congo digging up lithium so that urban elitists can buy their electric vehicles, install their power walls and pat themselves on the back about how worthy they are. This has to stop. Stop turning a blind eye to these kids dying in the Congo and other places. The mechanism in place so far has failed miserably to help child labourers, and One Nation has legislation already before the committee. It's our measure to prevent goods being made with child labour from entering Australia. A problem that continues to exist—in part due to the definition of 'slavery' used in the Modern Slavery Act, which the parliament passed in 2018—is that the commissioner will be operating under the definition of 'child slavery' which traps only 'the worst forms of child slavery', not all the forms of it. Article 3 of the International Labour Organization Convention Concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour includes, in part (d), 'work which, by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely to harm the health, safety or morals of children'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After all these years of talk about child slavery and all these Australian government actions, these poor children are still digging up cobalt with their bare hands when they should be at school. The International Labour Organization has a far better definition of 'child labour', which my office is using. Their definition of 'child labour'—not child slave labour; it's more encompassing—is 'a child under 14 who misses school, or would miss school if it were available, in order to perform work'. So it is when work takes them out of school. That definition captures people who are caught in a never-ending cycle of poverty and misery, with children who are working to bring home a tiny income to support their families and who never receive the necessary education to break out of that cycle of poverty. They are trapped in poverty and misery for their very short lives. These children work until their bodies are broken, and then their children take their place. Child labour may provide large corporations with extra profits from cheap minerals, coffee and textiles, amongst others, yet it's just plain wrong. It is inhuman.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I framed my bill to relate to child labour only because the Modern Slavery Amendment (Australian Anti-Slavery Commissioner) Bill 2023 has been on the drawing board for some time. My bill covers what this bill does not cover. Having seen the final version of this bill, I will provide the committee with an update on an amendment to my bill to allow the Anti-Slavery Commissioner to be the point of reporting of child labour on imported goods in addition to child slavery. One Nation will support this bill, and, as a servant of the people of Queensland, I will continue to pursue this issue.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:10</span>):  In prisons in this country, people are being used as slaves, working for little to no pay, all to drive further profits for big companies like Qantas and Bunnings. And governments are on the take from this labour exploitation too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Modern slavery is a structural feature of the Australian economy as a result of systemic discrimination towards migrants and minority groups. We've heard about how people with working holiday visas, seasonal workers and international students have been subject to serious exploitation in Australia, with visa conditions that tie workers to their employers allowing employers to manipulate workers. This was the subject of an explosive 2015 <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners </span>expose that proved that slave-like conditions have been rampant on Australian farms. Migrant workers aren't paid or are significantly underpaid, they're exploited by dodgy labour hire contractors, and many young women are being sexually harassed and forced to perform sexual favours in exchange for work or for visa extensions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But today I want to talk about the history of colonial slave labour of First Peoples in this country and how this continues within Australian prisons to this day. Governments go to great lengths to hide what goes on in prisons. Prisons are used to disappear and dehumanise people and even exploit people's labour for private profit. In prisons in this country, people are being exploited under slave-like conditions. Each state and territory runs prison industry programs, with private companies paying prisoner workers significantly below the minimum wage, exploiting cheap labour for their private profit. This is a subject that demands our attention, our scrutiny and our action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of you will be surprised to hear that Australia has the highest rate of incarceration in private, for-profit prisons in the world—even higher than the United States, your mates. But it is not just private, for-profit prisons that are exploiting people here; it is also state run prisons. Both private and public prisons have contracts with Australian corporations who are profiting from the use of slave-like labour and wage theft within prisons, exploiting prisoners for financial gain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not straightforward to find out which companies because they're all shamed and hiding. Public institutions and state entities utilise and benefit from prison labour. It's shady stuff. Governments have gone to great lengths to hide which companies are involved, what work people are being made to do and how much, if anything, workers are paid. Governments don't want the people to know that this is even happening. However, piecing together what little information we do have paints a stark picture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 42,000 people are jailed in Australian correctional centres, and many of them are working for as little as $2 an hour. The Australian minimum wage is $21.38 per hour. We know profit-gouging companies like Qantas and Bunnings have been using prison labour for various tasks, from refurbishing passenger headphones—you know the headphones you get on the plane; that's slave labour in prisons—to manufacturing nuts and bolts to put your stuff from Bunnings together. Despite many advocates shining a light on these practices, we still don't have proper transparency, with many companies refusing to confirm their involvement and governments refusing to give up the information. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Qantas—what hypocrites! They have an advertisement filled with black First Nations women singing, while the company hides the fact that First Nations women in prison are working for slave wages, untangling headphones used in flights. Shame! Hypocrisy! This country is no stranger to profiting from the slave labour of First Nations people. Legislation in almost every state and territory facilitated the enslavement of our people, who were subject to near total control of movement, over who they could marry or what jobs they could do. Our wages were stolen, our savings were taken, and our property was seized. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… if you are sitting down minding your own business, a station manager can come up to you and say, 'I want a couple of blackfellows' … Just like picking up a cat or a dog.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Historians, including Dr Rosalind Kidd and Dr Thalia Anthony, have documented how First Peoples of all ages, including children, were forcibly sent to work, often far away from their home and families, in often horrific conditions. Boys were generally sent to work on pastoral properties, while girls worked as domestic servants. All were exposed to physical and sexual abuse. This government has unfinished business in repaying wages to Aboriginal and South Sea Islander slaves whose unpaid labour allowed big businesses to reap substantial profits and helped maintain the Australian economy through the Great Depression—riding on the backs of blacks. Shame!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, it is not just private enterprises reaping the benefits. State governments are complicit in the exploitation, with agencies like the New South Wales corrective services industry generating millions in revenue from prison labour. From building fire trucks and toolboxes to constructing prison cells, the scope of state involvement is extensive and concerning. The Western Australian government runs the Prisoner Employment Program, which offers paid employment to people in minimum-security prisons in sectors such as clothing, food, textiles and furniture for prisons. The private Acacia Prison, run by Serco, partners with private companies and contractors such as metal workshops and wood workshops. Serco has to pay the state government 10 per cent of its revenue from this prison work. Most recently, the company reported paying $110,011 to the Western Australian government, meaning its revenue from the prison labour was more than $1.2 million per year. Clearly they can afford to pay their workers more. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of prison labour extends beyond economic exploitation. It affects the very fabric of our communities. Those in prison contribute to community projects, from maintaining racetracks to refurbishing public housing. But, while on the surface some of these might seem like good causes, that obscures the underlying issue of coerced labour within the prison system. Perhaps most insidious is the lack of accountability and oversight. Requests for data on the extent of prison labour have been repeatedly denied, kept hidden, practised in secrecy and shielding those who profit and enable this industry from accountability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what can we do about it? First, we need truth-telling—to talk about it more. We need to demand that companies and governments be transparent about their use of prison labour. Most importantly, we need to remember that everyone deserves to be treated fairly and with respect no matter their circumstances. I am asking that the government urgently refer the prison industry and the corporations known to use prison labour to the Fair Work Commission. This is what my amendment facilitates—that the Anti-Slavery Commissioner has the power to directly refer matters to the Fair Work Commission—and it demands that those who are working in prison are at the very least paid the minimum wage. I also call on the government to release the exact numbers and names of companies that employ prison labour in Australia, information which is currently unknown as requests for the data have been repeatedly denied by your agencies. This is the very least your government can do, and I foreshadow moving my second reading amendment on sheet 2613.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STERLE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  I'm pleased to make my contribution on the creation of the Modern Slavery Amendment (Australian Anti-Slavery Commissioner) Bill 2023. I congratulate the Attorney-General on progressing this important reform and delivering on Labor's election commitment to add this important role to our response in combatting modern slavery. In welcoming this important reform, I have a request that the new Australian Anti-Slavery Commissioner take a very, very close look at the operations of the many overseas crewed and flagged vessels that visit Australian ports. As colleagues are aware, modern slavery includes serious exploitative practices such as trafficking people, deceptive recruiting, forced labour and forced marriage. Unfortunately, forced labour is still used extensively in international shipping.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, the International Transport Workers' Federation boarded a ship in Mackay earlier this month, following concerns about crew mistreatment, wage theft and deplorable conditions. The MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Eleen Sofia</span> is registered in Liberia and is a flag-of-convenience ship—surprise, surprise. The ship has a shocking record. In February this year, the ITF boarded this same ship, the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Eleen Sofia</span>, when it was docked in Port Adelaide. Their main concerns at the time were overdue or unpaid wages and a lack of provisions—in other words, a lack of food for the crew. While the ITF fixed these issues at the time, they discovered exactly the same problem with the same ship when it pulled up alongside Mackay earlier this month.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Things are now so bad with the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Eleen Sofia</span> that the Australian Border Force relocated the vessel to Gladstone. You may well be wondering what a foreign flagged and crewed vessel has to do with Australian antislavery provisions. In addition to undertaking international voyages, this ship conducts coastal shipping between Australian ports under licence from the Australian government. Every time ITF inspectors board this ship at an Australian port, they find underpayment of workers and appalling conditions. When they boarded the ship in April this year, they found, as I said earlier, no food for the crew—think about that. The ITF, my mates, conducts inspections throughout Australia's mainland ports. These inspectors are led by former seafarer, MUA official and great mate of mine Ian Bray. Together, this team uncovered more than $30 million in stolen wages just last calendar year. Thirty-million dollars in unpaid wages is definitely something that the incoming Anti-Slavery Commissioner should focus on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the great privilege of joining ITF inspectors in Melbourne in November last year as part of their week of action. Although I could only do the one day, it was great to join a wonderful human being, Christian Roos from the ITF in Belgium. Christian is an experienced ITF inspector and former seafarer. The week of action targeted shipowners and agents that systematically steal the wages of workers who transport more than 95 per cent of consumer goods that Australians rely on. The ship I boarded that day was a Chinese flag vessel with two extremely wonderful captains. They were really decent people. They opened up their books, welcomed us onboard and gave us access to everything. I tagged along. As someone who has done safety inspections in trucking yards, I did have a bit of an idea of what Christian might be looking for. But it opened my eyes. He checked out medicines and air conditioners to make sure everything was alright.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He went into the kitchen, and this was interesting. There was food in storage in the fridge. For starters, the fridge and the freezer both weren't working properly. Then we inspected food, and he was pulling out the vegetable trays. There was moss on the vegetables. The chef was like, 'Well, I'll just cut it off and keep cooking.' But this is the magnificent job they do, let alone chasing wages. Let's not forget: these poor devils can be stuck on these ships for nine months. It was a real eye-opener, and I congratulate Ian and ITF. Keep up the great work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These workers, as I said before, are some of the most vulnerable. They often have their passports confiscated and are deprived of shore leave and decent accommodation. That's on top of their wages being stolen at times. At the moment, workers like those on the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Eleen Sofia</span> rely on ITF inspectors like Ian Bray and Christian Roos to make sure they get paid and get food to eat while they are away from home for up to nine months at a time. The ITF's recent, magnificent report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nowhere </span><span style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span style="font-style:italic;">o </span><span style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ide</span>, revealed that 70 per cent of ships carrying imports and exports onto our shores through our ports fail to meet international standards for wage payments. And yet, we don't think that's a drama. What a shocking system. But this has been around for years and years. I share the frustration here because I've been talking about this for years and years. That's why I urge the commissioner to work with the Fair Work Ombudsman and, of course, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority to combat the scourge of modern slavery at our ports and in Australian waters. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="250216" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator REYNOLDS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:28</span>):  I, too, rise to speak on the Modern Slavery Amendment (Australian Anti-Slavery Commissioner) Bill 2023. It is with a great sense of pride that I do so as the minister that brought this legislation into this place. I think it's also a great day of pride for everybody in this chamber, because what people don't see is that there are many common causes that, on all sides of this chamber, we work together on. I see Minister McCarthy there, who started this journey with me and Chris Crewther to get up a parliamentary inquiry into the need for a modern slavery bill in this nation. It was an amazing, 12-month, multipartisan inquiry that led to this bill, which was introduced and has now made the milestone of being reviewed and expanded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will come as no surprise to anybody in this chamber that I am incredibly passionate about the serious and important issue of modern slavery. I'm passionate about it because, as a Liberal, there is no greater cause than individual freedoms, including the freedom from servitude and slavery. It's about people's individual freedoms and liberties. I am so proud to have been involved in this, and it is a cause that I still continue to champion globally and here in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This coordinated and multipartisan approach started with the Australian government's 2004 Action Plan to Eradicate Trafficking in Persons, which was released by then prime minister John Howard. In 2015 the action plan was succeeded by the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking and Slavery 2015-19, which really laid out the framework for this current piece of legislation. As I said, in 2018, there was no prouder moment for me in this place than, as then Assistant Minister for Home Affairs, taking the first modern slavery legislation through this place. Those of you who were here at the time will know that it didn't have necessarily the smoothest of passages through this place. 'Modern slavery', at that point, was not a term that was well known in this country. Certainly, a lot of Australians didn't know that slavery existed in our own country and they weren't aware of their inadvertent contributions to slavery globally. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were a lot of negotiations at that time. I was a little disappointed that Senator Sheldon's contribution had a go at the coalition, because we did the best that we could to get a bill through this place. There were compromises that were made then, including the establishment of the Anti-Slavery Commissioner. But, now that businesses understand what modern slavery is, they understand their reporting requirements and they understand the prevalence of slavery throughout their global supply chains, I think this is a bill whose time has come. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In that context, the bill initially was designed to help businesses better control their own risks and also focus on businesses in their supply chains who benefit from the servitude of others. It also, at the time and subsequent to that, shone a light on the slavery risks in our international supply chains, including our supply chains for critical minerals and rare earths. That's one aspect I'd like to focus on here in the chamber today. I'd ask colleagues to remember that the supply chains today for our clean, green—so-called—supply chains are riddled with the servitude and enslavement of millions of people globally, particularly in China. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had it suggested to me by some that the environment is the greater good and that we should not worry about the human servitude that is not just prevalent but endemic in the solar panels that we buy, in the wind turbines that we use, in electric vehicles, in batteries and in many other new energy technologies. This is something that I will be pursuing further this year. We cannot turn a blind eye. It's just the right thing to do. We should never, ever accept a single person being enslaved for the production of these goods. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also a huge commercial cost. These goods are produced cheaply because they are produced on the backs of women, children and men who have been denied their freedoms, and many of them are in bonded labour as well. We can't go green on the backs of these millions of men, women and children who are forced to mine the minerals and rare earths and fabricate components of the goods that I've talked about. This year, the challenge for us as a nation is to deal with both. How do we get to net zero and net zero technologies but not on the backs of these men and women?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee process for this legislation did take over 12 months, but it was a significant achievement. I would like to acknowledge all of those in this place and those who have now left this place who were involved. The committee's report was <span style="font-style:italic;">H</span><span style="font-style:italic;">idden in plain sight</span>. I think that accurately captured the nature of what we discovered through this process. We had 225 submissions, we had 10 public hearings and we received this amazing amount of evidence which clearly demonstrated that slavery was something we needed to deal with. As the report name suggests, modern slavery is hidden in plain sight, but quite often we just don't know what we're looking for or, when we see it, what we are looking at. These heinous crimes that are committed against 50 million people—50 million people are today enslaved—are mostly in our supply chains. There are more people in slavery, in servitude, in bonded labour and in child labour today than at any other time in our nation's history—in fact, in human history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This again is quite a shocking situation, but all too often we can think, 'Well, it's not an Australian thing; we don't have slavery here.' Yes, we do, but what's worse is that we contribute to the enslavement of others overseas. Slavery comes in many forms, and one of the forms of slavery that I became aware of on a field trip to Cambodia in 2016 with Save the Children and other parliamentary colleagues is what's now called orphanage trafficking. It was absolutely shocking to realise that there were at least eight million children who had been trafficked into these congregate care institutions that were called orphanages when most of these children had parents. They had been removed from their families to scam money from us, from well-meaning church groups, from well-meaning social clubs, from well-meaning schools and from volunteers who come and have tourist experiences with children. It's hideous to think about. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That started a very long journey for me, here and globally, which still continues today. One of the things I am particularly proud of is that the Australian parliament led the way, because, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hidden </span><span style="font-style:italic;">in plain sight</span> report, which led to this bill, Australia became the first parliament and then the first nation to recognise orphanage trafficking as a form of modern slavery. Australia still continues that work, and we're doing so on a bipartisan basis. I see Senator O'Neill here. She's been a wonderful support at the IPU and elsewhere on the matter of raising awareness and tackling orphanage trafficking. So thank you for that ongoing support. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other things about modern slavery that is important to note in this place is that it distorts global markets, undercuts responsible business and can pose significant risk to entities that find themselves inadvertently benefiting from slavery practices at some point in the supply chain. I think most Australians who have solar panels on their house or who bought an EV that was made in China did so for all the right reasons. But it's most likely that they not only were made and assembled in Xinjiang but have components and minerals that come from other countries that have child labour and the most revolting environmental practices all the way through their supply chains. Australians don't realise this, but we, as a chamber and as people, have to highlight that so that we can change practices so that, when people purchase these goods, they don't purchase goods that are made off the backs of children, women and men who have been enslaved. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly our region is also the global epicentre of modern slavery, with about two-thirds of victims right here in our region across the Asia-Pacific. One of the most egregious things about slavery is that this exploitation of people, this commoditisation of people, is a highly lucrative business. Not only does it provide those who manufacture the goods with slave labour and give them a competitive edge but it generates over US$200 billion a year. The commodification and the exploitation of people is a very lucrative business. We can change that. We can make change, and this legislation is a great vehicle for Australians to do that. But to start to do that we also have to realise the personal and the human cost of producing the things that we consume every day here in Australia, which come off the back of women and children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude by reflecting on the key pillars in our national strategy against modern slavery. There are five national strategic priorities that provide the foundation for our ongoing fight against modern slavery. The first is prevention. The second is a national strategic priority within the criminal justice system and criminal law: disrupt, investigate and prosecute modern slavery. Here in our nation—never mind overseas—we still have a long way to go to work with law enforcement and particularly border protection officials to actually recognise what slavery looks like, as people come through the borders: people who come through on legitimate visas, minors who come through accompanied by adults who are not their parents, and women who come through to work in the sex trade in Australia, and who are cycled through brothels on legitimate visas. We've still got a lot of work to do. The fourth national strategic priority is partnerships. This is not something the federal government can deal with on its own. It requires law enforcement, welfare agencies and victim protection organisations to understand what is required and to have the courage to work together to do that. The fifth national strategic priority is research. The five pillars were established in 2020 by the former coalition government, and they do provide a good framework. This is a proud coalition achievement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finish by talking about something else that the coalition is very proud of: the first Magnitsky-style thematic sanctions framework to hold to account perpetrators of human rights violations and abuses, particularly those involved in modern slavery practices. Let's call a spade a spade. We've got a tool that we introduced that we can use to highlight this. Let me again be very honest and clear. There are millions of these 50 million people enslaved in China today. They are in enormous detention facilities, primarily in Xinjiang. There are Uighurs. There are Tibetans who have been taken away from their families at a very young age and put into Han language boarding schools. In fact over 80 per cent of Tibetan children have now been removed from their families. They go into these education facilities. They lose their cultural identity, and then they get shipped into farms and factories, pretty much as indentured labour. There are also North Koreans provided by the North Korean government to China in bonded labour in servitude. What I would say to the government is that it is time to have a look at the powers that we have to call this behaviour out and say that it is not okay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a lot more that we can do together. While there are many other things on our agenda, including net zero, let's strive for a future here. We can use this bill and the amendments in this bill to say that net zero is important, but so are the human lives of those who will build that new future.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:43</span>):  Slavery is indeed an evil that, sadly, continues throughout the world right now—in this moment, on this very day. Millions and millions of people around the world, including Australians, are subject to servitude. Slavery is a concept that we think of as a long-ago phenomenon, and we seem somewhat blind to the reality that it didn't occur long ago in Egypt, nor did it finish with the change of legislation about slaves being units of labour in the United States of America. Slavery is with us, and it is amongst us here in our proud democratic nation of Australia in 2024. As I speak that sentence, I am both ashamed and despairing of some of the worst excesses of human nature that would ever think that enslaving another human being could ever be okay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a matter of public knowledge now that I carry a couple of very important things on my person. One of them is a set of rosary beads, a symbol of my Catholic faith in which I find great comfort, and the other is the declaration of human rights. For me these two things are interconnected. People of faith, people of goodwill, people of no faith—we all share a common humanity. That is what is expressed in that declaration. It's human rights for everyone, manifesting itself in very different ways across the faith traditions and in the public practice of people of goodwill, regardless of whatever faith or philosophy they might adhere to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today in this debate we are talking about one of the most fundamental human rights. The reality is that when an individual is forced to work for another without payment, enslaved as an item of property for another individual—when one is denied agency—this at every turn is a severe breach of human rights. Fundamental rights, however, cannot be taken for granted. They have to be taught. They have to be cherished by every single person. Sadly, we are at a point where we need to legislate to clarify our actions around what we're going to do in response to this profound scourge. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The right to agency is vital. It aligns with my values and how I see the world—that enslavement should never be and that freedom is a fundamental right that should be practised in full, while being mindful of where it meets the freedoms of others. The belief in the right to agency and having the capacity to live your best life for the period of time that you're here on this planet in the great common family of humanity is part of the reason I became a teacher. This belief in the fundamental human rights of my fellow citizens of the world is another reason I come to this place as a parliamentarian to do this work of legislating where it is necessary, where we seem to have lost something in the broad compact about what common law and common good should look like. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">'Modern' is a word with both connotation and denotation. Often we see it as a positive. <span style="font-style:italic;">Thoroughly Modern Millie</span> was one of my favourite films that my mother showed me—great music, great dancing—where the sense of 'modern' was full of hope and promise. Sadly, when we talk about 'modern slavery', it is a term that has severe negative connotations because it covers an enormous range of exploitative practices, including human trafficking, slavery, forced labour, child labour, the removal of human organs and slavery-like practices that have been long documented as practices of commerce in days gone by and things that most of us would only have seen through the media or in film, or read in novels. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge here the contribution of Senator Linda Reynolds, who referred to the work that she has done, in leading other parliamentarians at the International Parliamentary Union, in identifying the scourge of orphan trafficking and in addressing the very real challenge of the proper management of children in orphanages to be free and to not be enslaved and become units of commerce for those who would exploit them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think one of the saddest elements of modern slavery is that it reminds me once again of that very old adage that the love of money is the root of all evil. It's not money in and of itself. We know that charities that benefit from people supporting them do incredibly good work. Money in and of itself and profit in and of itself are not a problem. But gross misuse of the fundamental rights of others for personal profit and gain was always wrong, is always wrong, will always be wrong and must continue to be addressed in all its variations and forms by people of goodwill in parliaments around the globe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think part of the problem we face right now is that we live in a global economy and we're consuming so many products, services and goods that we don't know the origins of. Sadly the reality is that some of us will be consuming the products of slavery. I go to the Uighurs in Xinjiang Province in the People's Republic of China. It is now commonly known across the world that there are millions of people enslaved there. I've spoken with advocates for the freedom of those enslaved Uighurs in Xinjiang Province, who've indicated they're trying to use new technologies to identify the kind of weave of fabric so that we can begin to see where these materials are coming from and make informed decisions to ensure that we don't purchase the product of enslaved workforces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Supply chains in their globalisation can be very powerful and very effective. We cannot undo them, nor should we, but they are opaque. In fact some companies, disreputably and with a love of money trumping any respect for the fundamental dignity of human beings, seek profit and absolutely and deliberately obscure the truth of where and how their products are being made, created and distributed. That's really why the bill that's been put forward is of vital importance. It's essential that Australia rises to the challenge that is before us and that we stand up for the rights to which we are committed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Reynolds mentioned the importance of the Magnitsky rules and laws around the world, and I want to give particular praise to our former colleague here in this place and my good friend former senator Kimberley Kitching for the great leadership that she showed in advancing our legislative endeavours to ensure that we had the Magnitsky sanctions at our fingertips when they were required. That is a sign of how important the work of individual senators can be, and how we as a parliament collectively and as a team of senators can act not only in the national interest but in the international interest with our fellow minded true believers in democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to echo the observation of Senator Reynolds with regard to the boarding school situation in Tibet—or in the province called Tibet that is now occupied by China. The boarding schools that exist there are absolutely enslaving young people in a way that robs them of their Tibetan heritage, their language and their history for what can only be considered political purposes and creates a potential workforce that I hope is not enslaved in the same way that we have seen amongst the Uighur population in another province of China.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very clear to me that, under the leadership of Anthony Albanese and this Labor government, Australia has absolutely returned to the world stage. When we come to the table to participate with other developed democracies to do our work alongside them in the interests of humanity, we have to make sure that our own house is in order. We have to practise what we preach otherwise our words mean nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, in my work representing this great nation with my parliamentary colleagues from across the political divide, we've seen countries which, right now in these days, are seeking to declare themselves democratic states, and which use the language of democracy but are seeking to destabilise the fundamentals of rules based order that are expressed in the UN declaration of human rights. The geopolitical realities of our time are very, very challenging. Benignly believing that we can assert fundamental human rights and believing that freedom is held by every individual—even those in our own country—is a position I wish we could hold, but it is, sadly, not matching the reality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fight against slavery is occurring all around the world with many allies. Among those here in Australia, I want to particularly mention the Minderoo Foundation, which is seeking change. The modern slavery index is an important tool to measure and respond to slavery around the world. The scale of the problem before us is enormous. There were 50 million people estimated to be in modern slavery in 2021. The Australian Catholic Anti-Slavery Network is another organisation that shares the values which I've espoused and which I expect most Australians would share with me. The ACAN indicate that action against modern slavery is a fundamental Catholic social teaching. Pope Francis called modern slavery 'a crime against humanity' because that is what it is. He pledged with other global religious leaders to work to rid the world of this affront to human dignity and human freedom. I certainly support the network's mission to rid slavery from all Catholic supply chains and help to quash the evil of modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Patron saint St Josephine Bakhita, born in Darfur, was sold into slavery at a young age. Before ending up in Italy in 1882, she was beaten and abused by her former masters. However, her arrival proved to be a profound change for her circumstances. She was entrusted by the Canossian Sisters, and, for the next 50 years, she enacted God's love through cooking, sewing, embroidery and attending to the door. During her last days, she relived the painful days of her slavery more than once and begged, 'Please loosen the chains; they are heavy.' Surrounded by the sisters, she died on 8 February 1947, and 8 February has been designated as a day of prayer, reflection and action to end the injustice of human trafficking. I'm proud of the Australian government for taking this action. Today I feel my morals, my creed and my identity, as a person of faith and as a citizen of the world who supports the United Nations in its work and the fundamentals embedded in the declaration of human rights, are combined in this bill. I came to the parliament to make change and, ultimately, to be a force for good in this world. This piece of legislation is an example of the way in which our parliament can work harmoniously and powerfully to deliver public benefit for the common good here in our country and in other jurisdictions.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Education, Assistant Minister for Regional Development and Deputy Manager of Government Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  I thank all honourable senators who've contributed to this debate on the Modern Slavery Amendment (Australian Anti-Slavery Commissioner) Bill 2023. I would also like to thank the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for its consideration of the bill. The government has moved amendments to the bill to fully implement the committee's recommendations, and has moved amendments to the explanatory memorandum to address some of the additional comments arising from the committee's inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill would not be possible without the work and engagement of victims and survivors of modern slavery, and civil society and business stakeholders who have campaigned over many years for the establishment of the first Commonwealth Anti-Slavery Commissioner, and I want to acknowledge all of these individuals and organisations. The bill delivers on the Albanese government's election commitment to establish a Commonwealth antislavery commissioner. Modern slavery is among the most egregious forms of human rights abuses and deprives victims of their dignity, fundamental rights and freedoms. We know that modern slavery occurs in the Australian community. We have heard cases of domestic servitude, individuals trafficked into sex work and a young girl at risk of being sent overseas for a forced marriage. In January this year a Melbourne man was sentenced to three years and six months imprisonment for forced labour offences after he forced a person to work in his confectionary shop. There is no place for modern slavery in any form in the Australian community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To strengthen Australia's response to modern slavery, this bill amends the Modern Slavery Act to establish Australia's first Commonwealth Anti-Slavery Commissioner. The recent review of the Modern Slavery Act verified the long-identified need for an independent specialist commissioner to enhance our response. This bill establishes the commissioner. The bill confers important functions of the commissioner. The commissioner will support, engage and empower victims and survivors of modern slavery. The commissioner will provide targeted support to businesses in Australia to help them address risks of modern slavery practices in their operations and supply chains. To ensure we, as the government, can continue to lead by example, the commissioner will advocate for continuous improvement in policy and practice. The commissioner will be independent and will have discretion in performing or exercising their functions. The government thanks the Senate committee for the inquiry into this bill and for their recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government accepts the committee's recommendations 1 to 4 and welcomes the committee's fifth recommendation: that the bill be passed, subject to the implementation of the recommendations. The recommendations will be actioned through government amendments to this bill. These include: implementing recommendation 1 by clarifying the application of the definition of 'sensitive information' in the bill; implementing recommendation 2 by specifying that a principal objective of the commissioner's strategic plan must include development of guidance to support victims and survivors of modern slavery; implementing recommendation 3 by requiring the commissioner to engage with victims of modern slavery in carrying out their functions; and implementing recommendation 4 by clarifying in legislation that the commissioner is able to refer matters for investigation to relevant Commonwealth government agencies, including to law enforcement agencies, so potential modern slavery matters can be dealt with appropriately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will also support the amendments proposed by Senator Cash. I would like to thank the opposition for working collaboratively with us on this bill. I acknowledge there have been calls for the commissioner to do more, including to undertake investigations, to compel business to cooperate and to issue penalties for noncompliance. The government is currently considering options to further strengthen the Modern Slavery Act that may inform consideration of the commissioner's future role. However, this bill focuses on critical, core functions of the commissioner that will set a foundation for further action in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The establishment of the Anti-Slavery Commissioner is an important reform. The commissioner will be a powerful and effective force for change in Australia. I table an addendum to the explanatory memorandum relating to the Modern Slavery Amendment (Australian Anti-Slavery Commissioner) Bill 2023. The addendum responds to matters raised by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. I also table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved on this bill.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Digital ID Bill 2024</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We, the undersigned citizens and residents of Australia, draw the attention of the Senate to the Digital ID Act 2023 introduced by the Labor Government. This legislation seeks to establish a framework for a permanent digital identity for every Australian, amalgamating sensitive personal details into a single digital system. It must be repealed. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Process and Transparency: The process through which the Digital ID Act 2023 has been introduced and expedited is deeply concerning. The limited period for public submissions and the lack of comprehensive debate in Parliament diminish public engagement and oversight, essential for such impactful legislation. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Potential for Overreach and Misuse: The Act lacks precise limitations on the powers it grants, raising serious concerns about potential governmental and corporate overreach. The provision for a government agency to mandate digital ID for accessing certain services, under vaguely defined conditions, opens avenues for misuse and infringes on personal freedoms and privacy. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Privacy and Security Concerns: Centralising personal data within a digital ID system significantly increases the risk of cybersecurity threats, data breaches, and unauthorised surveillance. History has shown that the aggregation of personal information can lead to targeted misuse, both by state and non-state actors. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Implications for Civil Liberties: By potentially mandating digital ID for access to essential services, the bill threatens to undermine civil liberties, discriminate against those lacking digital literacy, and pave the way for an intrusive surveillance apparatus.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Therefore, your petitioners request that the Senate take all necessary measures to repeal the legislation urgently. </span>
            </p>

                  </a>  What we're seeing here is selling Australians out—the Labor Party with some ridiculous omnibus bill which takes important changes off the back of the PWC scandal and puts them with a dud deal for Australians when it comes to the export of our gas. They should be ashamed of themselves. You're selling us out. You're telling people on JobSeeker, youth allowance, all these other social security payments, 'Stay in poverty. We can't afford to help you guys, sorry.' </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't have the money to do it and at the same time we're not collecting anything from our offshore gas. Hundreds of billions of dollars of LNG gets exported and today there is not a cent of petroleum resource rent tax. We'll hear people cry, 'Well, they're paying corporate tax.' They've minimised it below one per cent in recent years. This is embarrassing. More Australians need to know what you're doing. You're selling us out. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">11:51</span>):  I will now put Senator Gallagher's amendment to the routine of hours variation, and that includes the bills from (v) through to (viii). I will remind senators that I have been lenient this time, but there was no change in the vote on any of those four bills and so the proper course of action is there should have been no division between the bills. But a division is required on the amendment. </span>

                  </a>  Here we are in a budget week, and we could be in Moscow or we could be in any other communist country. You've seen the green bells for the other place ringing all morning. And why was the House of Reps voting all morning? It was to shut down debate on the new vehicle efficiency standard so that no-one in that chamber who is supporting the bill or not supporting the bill could have their say. And here we are again, with the Labor Party putting this bill into their guillotine motion so that no-one in this chamber gets to have a say on the biggest change to our transport sector since we got rid of the horse and cart. This is what weak leaders do when they are afraid. They're afraid of dissent and afraid of different ideas, and it's so typical that they got into bed with the Greens. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's, frankly, farcical that the government believes this motion would ensure appropriate consideration of bills by Senate committees. This motion, if passed, would allow not only those bills listed in the motion but any bill related to the 2024-25 budget to be referred to a Senate committee to report by 24 June this year. The Senate should deal with these bills and any future bills that relate to the budget in the ordinary way. When they're introduced, the Senate can then decide which bills are or are not referred to committees and when the committees will report.</span>

The bill has been amended at the committee's request to require a report of the Minister's review of legislative rules relating to fees charged by entities in the Australian Government Digital ID System be tabled in each House of Parliament. The bill has also been amended to clarify that protection from liability for accredited entities is applied only in respect of actions or other proceedings brought by other accredited entities and relying parties participating in the Australian Government Digital ID System. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I also wish to draw Senators' attention to the committee's remarks in relation to the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Migration Amendment (Removal and Other Measures) Bill 2024</span>. The committee sought advice in relation to this bill when it was first introduced and has received a response from the Minister which is addressed in this Digest. The bill raises a number of scrutiny concerns in relation to trespass on rights and liberties, the imposition of significant penalties and significant matters that have been left to delegated legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to significant matters in delegated legislation, of particular concern to the committee is proposed section 199F, to be inserted into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Act 1958</span>. This section would allow the minister to designate a 'removal concern country' by legislative instrument. Senators will be aware that the momentous impact of making such a declaration is to effectively ban citizens of that country from applying for a visa to come to Australia. The minister advised the committee determinations made under proposed section 199F are in the national interest and are therefore a matter for the Executive, and that the intention is for countries to be aware of Australia's position that they should facilitate removal of affected persons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee's position is that the designation of countries as removal concern countries is a significant matter which should be subject to full parliamentary approval and would be most appropriate for primary legislation. The committee's view is that parliamentarians are clearly capable of appropriately assessing whether a legislative proposal is in the national interest and the committee has noted that the Government would have the opportunity to put its position during parliamentary debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee also takes the opportunity to draw to the attention that an instrument designating a country as a removal concern country would not be subject to parliamentary control through the disallowance process. The committee notes that this crucial information was not provided with sufficient clarity in the explanatory memorandum to the bill, nor was it identified or justified in the minister's response to this committee. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Any bills which empower the making of non-disallowable instruments should clearly set out the legislative authority for the exemption from disallowance in the explanatory memorandum so that this information may be properly scrutinised and considered by the Parliament. Explanatory memoranda should also justify why the exemption is necessary and appropriate in the context of each individual instrument.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is particularly salient in situations such as the current bill where the measures to be included in non-disallowable instruments are matters of high policy impact and which trespass on individual rights and liberties. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In this instance the committee has not been furnished with any justification as to why it is necessary and appropriate for instruments made under proposed section 199F to be exempt from disallowance. Noting the significant consequences of the designation of a country as a removal concern country, which would inevitably affect a significant number of people, the committee is of the view that any such designation should be subject to parliamentary control through the disallowance process. However, at a minimum, a full justification for this exemption should have been set out in the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee also notes the advice that it is the intention of the Government that should the power to designate a country as a removal concern country be exercised, countries would be individually designated. While welcoming this statement of the Government's intentions, the committee notes that this is not required by the provision as drafted and this protection would be guaranteed through an amendment to the bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, I wish to draw the Senate's attention to the committee's comments on standing appropriations in the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Parliamentary </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Business Resources Legislation Amendment (Review Implementation and Other Measures) Bill 2024</span>. This bill seeks to amend the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2022</span>,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>which appropriates the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the purpose of making payments of financial assistance to, or for the benefit of, parliamentarians under arrangements prescribed by the National Anti-Corruption Commission Regulations 2023. This bill seeks to amend the existing standing appropriation to add the words <span style="font-style:italic;">former </span><span style="font-style:italic;">parliamentarians</span>, with the effect that the standing appropriation will extend to all payments that can be made in accordance with the NACC Regulations, including those made to former parliamentarians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Standing appropriations enable entities to spend money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund on an ongoing basis, usually for indefinite amounts and duration. Once a standing appropriation is enacted, any expenditure under it does not require regular parliamentary approval and therefore escapes direct parliamentary control.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Given the difficulty of ongoing parliamentary oversight over enacted standing appropriations, the committee expects a robust justification for why a standing appropriation should be established or expanded in the first place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee has requested advice from the Special Minister of State as to:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Tobacco plain packaging was bold policy achieved in the face of some often savage legal and rhetorical assault. It was imaginative policy. And it was world-leading policy: 26 countries have followed our lead and introduced their own such laws. It's a policy that has saved lives and will continue to save lives. When plain packaging was introduced, around 16% of Australian adults smoked. Today, just over 10% do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But all that progress could be undone, if we do not urgently address the threat posed by a new public health menace: vaping.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">E-cigarettes and vapes were sold to governments and communities around the world as a therapeutic good: a product that could help hardened smokers—usually people in their 40s or 50s—to quit smoking and kick the habit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If vapes are therapeutic goods then it is entirely appropriate that Australia should regulate them as therapeutic goods, instead of allowing them to be sold alongside candy bars in convenience stores, often down the road from schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, this Bill does not take away the ability for patients to legitimately access therapeutic vapes to help them quit smoking or manage their nicotine dependence, if that is deemed to be clinically appropriate for that patient.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill affirms Australia's commitment to its international obligations as a party to the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Under this Convention, parties are obliged to develop and implement effective policies to not only to prevent and reduce tobacco consumption and exposure, but also to prevent and reduce nicotine addiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is critical to introduce new safeguards in accordance with this commitment, to prevent the current and future public health risks associated with vaping. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill takes strong action to ban the importation, domestic manufacture, supply, commercial possession and advertisement of vaping goods, except in limited circumstances. It is a necessary step to address the growing risk posed by vaping in Australia, particularly to youth and young adults, while preserving legitimate patient access to therapeutic vaping goods for smoking cessation and the management of nicotine dependence, where clinically appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These measures complement changes that have been instituted at the border. Together, these are intended to arrest and reverse the increasing rates of vaping, and to prevent long term adverse effects on population health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reforms in this Bill are world-leading. Vaping is a very serious public health menace and the rapid rise in vaping among young people is creating a whole new generation of persons with nicotine dependence in our schools and communities. It poses a major threat to population health and Australia's success in tobacco control, and that is why this Bill is so critical to addressing these challenges now. The global health community is watching us closely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The highly addictive nature of nicotine, the sophisticated marketing to vulnerable populations, and the direct inhalation of substances into the lungs, mean that risks to population health associated with vaping can be severe. Numerous studies highlight concerns about potential adverse effects, including impact on adolescent brain development, worsened pregnancy outcomes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and cancer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is not surprising, as vapes have been found to include over 200 chemicals, including listed poisons, heavy metals such as nickel and chromium, and chemical by-products produced during heating such as formaldehyde, nitrosamines, acetone, and acrolein. Some of these chemicals are used in weed killer, nail polish remover and even to embalm dead bodies. A range of other health risks are also associated with vape use, including severe burns, poisoning and seizures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The evidence is clear: people who have never smoked, and who use vapes, are more likely to take up cigarette smoking than those who do not.<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>And dual use of vaping and tobacco products may even result in worse health outcomes compared to smoking alone. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Perhaps most worryingly, the long-term health risks of vaping are not yet fully known. Nicotine vapes may worsen mental health conditions, and amplify stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Parents, teachers and doctors are reporting that nicotine dependence is impacting learning behaviours and well-being in schools. In addition, the Australian Dental Association warns that vaping may be setting the next generation up for a raft of oral health issues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The latest national data show that 1 in 6 (16%) secondary school students aged 12 to 17 years reported recent vaping in 2022/23—a four-fold increase since the previous survey from 2017 (4%). These statistics are alarming and support the need for strong, decisive and urgent action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Vapes are being deliberately marketed and supplied to young Australians, with colours, flavours and packaging specifically designed to attract them. Vaping goods are aggressively promoted by the vaping industry in online advertising and other youth-focused media channels. Many vapes are deliberately mislabelled as containing 'no nicotine' or 'zero nicotine' or even unlabelled to avoid detection and seizure. However, the Therapeutic Goods Administration has reported that approximately 90% of all tested vapes are found to contain nicotine, no matter what appears on the label. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further, we know that a significant number of vape stores around Australia are located within walking distance of schools—in some states it is as high as 9 in 10 stores—and worryingly, around one in six high school students is now a regular vaper. Allowing these trends to continue is not an acceptable option. This is a crisis that deserves our national attention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill appropriately responds by implementing the second stage of the Government's vaping reform measures. The first stage commenced earlier this year through amendments to regulations. The importation of disposable single use vapes, irrespective of nicotine content or therapeutic claims, was banned on 1 January 2024, subject to very limited exceptions. The importation of all other vapes was banned on 1 March 2024, unless certain requirements are met in relation to those vapes, including licences and permits, and pre-market notifications under the Therapeutic Goods Act. These reforms focus on turning off the tap at the border as a necessary first step to combat supply. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The second stage, to be effected by this Bill, will regulate the importation, domestic manufacture, supply, possession and advertisement of all vapes under the Therapeutic Goods Act. This is achieved by extending the scope of the Therapeutic Goods Act to all vapes, not simply therapeutic vapes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill institutes changes to ban non-therapeutic vapes and ensure that therapeutic vapes are supplied through pharmacy settings. Advertisements targeted at young people will be banned. Disposable vapes will be banned and widespread promotion and availability will be limited. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will be complemented by changes to regulatory settings for therapeutic vapes to increase quality standards, significantly reduce flavours and introduce plain packaging. Similar safeguards already apply to other prescription medicines, including those for smoking cessation and the management of nicotine dependence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Because let us not be in any doubt: vapes were sold to the Australian community as therapeutic goods, to aid those seeking to quit cigarette smoking. And so, it is entirely appropriate to regulate them as we do any other therapeutic goods—through regulation that simultaneously ensures legitimate access and provides sound public protection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is not taking away the ability for patients to legitimately access vaping goods for smoking cessation or the management of nicotine dependence, where clinically appropriate. The reforms simply ensure that vapes are only accessed under the clinical supervision of a medical or nurse practitioner, to provide an opportunity for users to receive appropriate advice on the risks associated with vaping, the benefits of not smoking, and any up-to-date health advice as part of their usual care. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Deliberately mislabelling vapes to conceal the presence or content of nicotine will no longer be a means for suppliers to avoid compliance and enforcement. It will be easier for authorities to prove that vapes are unlawful and to enable their seizure. Importantly, there will be no legitimate supply through vape shops, convenience stores or other retail outlets, such as petrol stations or milk bars. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reforms to strengthen the regulation of all vaping goods irrespective of nicotine content was recommended in the National Tobacco Strategy 2023-2030. The Strategy was developed in consultation with a wide range of stakeholders and was endorsed by all Commonwealth, state and territory health ministers in 2023. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill provides a single consistent framework that will apply nationally to the regulation of all vapes. The federal cooperative scheme between Commonwealth, states and territories for the regulation of therapeutic goods will be extended to vaping goods to ensure comprehensive controls. The scheme is achieved through the application of corresponding laws enacted in each state and territory, with Western Australia having recently introduced legislation to the Parliament of Western Australia to enact their own corresponding law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The extension of the Therapeutic Goods Act to vapes is appropriate and necessary in the circumstances and will facilitate a national approach by enabling all jurisdictions to use the same legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Bill, there are significant penalties for importing, manufacturing, supplying, possessing and advertising vapes except in certain circumstances. Consistent with the federal cooperative scheme, the Commonwealth will take responsibility for enforcing importation, manufacture, sponsor supply and advertisement. The states and territories will take responsibility for enforcing wholesale supply, retail supply and commercial possession. The Australian Border Force will lead enforcement at the border. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Therapeutic Goods Administration and state and territory officers will exercise powers and functions, in concert with police authorities as required, and particularly when organised crime is involved. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Advertising of vapes to the public will be banned in almost all instances. Offences and civil penalties will apply to this conduct and operate in conjunction with bans on advertising in the new tobacco control laws passed in Parliament last year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Bans on the supply of vapes outside of pharmacy settings go to the heart of these reforms and will be principally enforced by the states and territories, with the support of the Commonwealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For the first time under the Therapeutic Goods Act, there will be offences and civil penalties for the commercial possession of vapes. These are aimed at unlawful retailers and operators of warehouses and other persons with significant quantities of vapes who deny having been involved in supply. These are tiered offences, with higher maximum penalties depending on the quantities of vapes possessed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new ban on possession includes an exception for personal use, including by young Australians who are deliberately being targeted by an industry determined to make a profit. This Bill is not about penalising persons who are using vapes, whether adults or children. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The focus of the Bill is to criminalise the illicit importation, manufacture, supply, advertisement and commercial possession of vapes. This is needed to protect young Australians in particular. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The penalties for breaching the new requirements are significant. These are designed to ensure that the reforms provide a strong deterrence from engaging in conduct that may harm Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government knows that some people will say that the reforms will simply grow the black market. However, effective enforcement has been hampered by the current regulatory settings. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will address the methods that certain operators are using to import, advertise and supply nicotine vapes illegally. Strengthening the regulation of all vapes, through enhancing border controls, banning all disposable single use vapes and ending the supply of vapes outside of pharmacy settings, will make it easier to identify and disrupt the illicit supply of vapes and take effective enforcement action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Strengthened enforcement activities across all levels of the supply chain will also combat the black market. To support the implementation and enforcement of these reforms, the Government is providing an additional $25 million to the Australian Border Force and $56.9 million to the TGA over two years. And all states and territories are committed to sharing and increasing compliance action and supporting a national enforcement approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The vaping reforms complement a wider set of actions being taken by the Government. This includes $63.4 million for new public health information campaigns to prevent and reduce the use of tobacco and e-cigarettes. This includes a dedicated Youth Vaping Education campaign, the first phase of which launched in February, with future phases planned to start later this year; and the National Tobacco and E-Cigarette campaign, which is planned to launch mid-year. These campaigns together will ensure all Australians are aware of the risks associated with vaping, and the supports available to help them quit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The measures in this Bill reflect evidence that a comprehensive range of demand and supply reduction measures can be highly effective in changing drug related attitudes and behaviours. Reforms recommended by the TGA and implemented in 2018 to make codeine a prescription only medicine are one example of this. Evidence showed that, after the codeine reforms were implemented, rates of codeine misuse and sales reduced substantially.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the meantime, a range of support services continue to be available nationally to help people quit smoking and the use of e-cigarettes. This includes programs run through state and territory health services and Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services, and the provision of quit advice and support through Quitline counsellors and other health professionals, such as GPs, pharmacists and specialists. It also includes 'first line' smoking cessation products that continue to be available, including medicines and patches that are subsidised on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also providing $29.5 million to expand specialised programs and services to support Australians to quit smoking and vaping, and $141 million to extend and widen the Tackling Indigenous Smoking program to reduce both vaping and smoking among First Nations people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We must slow and reverse the importation, manufacture, supply and advertisement of vapes in Australia, other than for legitimate, therapeutic use. We know that the job will be difficult, but so much great work is already underway to safeguard the health of Australians from the risks of vaping. The reforms introduced by this Bill will further this work and critically empower authorities to stop the spread of vapes endangering the health of young Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is just over 50 years since Labor introduced the first restrictions on tobacco advertising, and just over 10 years since we introduced Australia's world leading plain packaging laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As Parliamentarians in this place today, we all have the opportunity and responsibility to act now, to safeguard the health of young Australians for generations to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">How will history judge us 10 or 50 years from now, if—instead of acting—we equivocate: squandering this opportunity and ignoring our responsibility?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, this motion—as the Senate has done before—calls upon all senators to engage in debates and commentary respectfully and to refrain from inflammatory and divisive comments both inside and outside the chamber at all times. The conflict in the Middle East has unacceptably infected nations around the world, including, tragically, our own. The actions of some have created division. They have fuelled hatred, and they have spurred a most horrific rise in antisemitism. Antisemitism is one of the most ancient forms of hatred. It corrodes societies. As we witnessed during the Holocaust, with the deliberate killing of some six million Jews, when antisemitism is left unchecked, it can result in the most heinous of outcomes. Antisemitism manifests itself in many ways—</span>

These include the use of chants and phrases like calls for intifada and the chant 'from the river to the sea'. We have seen in our country, as in far too many other places around the world, the increasing use of these chants and phrases. Let us be very clear: they call for violence and they stand against the existence of the state of Israel. </span>

These are deliberate acts to intimidate Jewish Australians. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator BIRMINGHAM:</span>
                  </a>  These have been deliberate acts of intimidation against Jewish Australians. They have been deliberate acts of antisemitism. They have been acts that have put a stain upon our nation and our nation's reputation for inclusivity and tolerance and for being a nation that stands strongly against antisemitism.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should have seen stronger leadership. We should have seen more forceful responses to these acts as they came. Had we seen that in the early days, perhaps we could have avoided some of the consequential impacts in the months that followed. We have seen not just a rise in protests—calling for peace or ceasefire or expressing a view about the actions of the Israeli government—but also a continuous rise in antisemitism in the targeting of Jewish Australians. The impact of that is that there are too many Australians of Jewish background who now go about their lives in Australia in a state of fear. They fear for their safety. They fear for the safety of their communities. They fear congregating in their synagogues. They fear for their children when they wear their school uniforms going to or from their schools. Such fear should have no existence in our country—no place, tolerance or acceptance. It should not exist at all. The fact that it does requires and demands the strongest possible action and leadership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The phrases I've highlighted today are ones that have not just been uttered in protests. They've not just been uttered in rallies. They've not just been uttered in the types of unacceptable gatherings—they're calling them protests—at universities around the country or in other places. But, indeed, 'from the river to the sea' has been accepted and even said by members of the government. That is why we are very clear in putting this motion to the Senate, supporting and highlighting the responses the Prime Minister has given. We wish he had given these responses proactively, not reactively. We wish that he would show leadership in responding and dealing to the use of such phrases that fuel and drive antisemitism. But that leadership has been lacking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We call on the Prime Minister to take appropriate action and ensure members of his government and his party do not act in ways and repeat phrases that incite and fuel hatred or antisemitism or are used by those who incite and fuel hatred or antisemitism. It is totally unacceptable for Mr Albanese to escape scrutiny or to evade responsibility for the use of such phrases and actions. To say that he hasn't spoken about or acted upon such use is a failure of leadership. Mr Albanese, consistent with what he has said publicly, should act in relation to the use of such phrases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, as we have been clear, we call on all senators to engage in debates and commentary respectfully. The Senate has said this before, and it is sad that we must say it again. But we say it because it is critical that all of us think about our responsibility to ensure that we act in ways that give all Australians the right to feel safe. Right now, Jewish Australians do not. The government needs to take stronger action and Mr Albanese needs to show greater leadership to ensure that they do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AOU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WONG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Foreign Affairs and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  This government represents the Australian community more completely than any government in this country's history. More than half of our government are women, and we have more First Nations members than any government that has preceded us. We have members of parliament from many different countries, with ancestries from many different cultures. We have members of many different faiths: Christianity, Judaism, Islam and Hinduism. We are proud of how much we represent the richness and the diversity of the Australian community, and we are also deeply conscious of the responsibility this brings with it. We do not speak only to one part of the community, nor do we speak only for one part of the community. Ours is a pluralist nation, a nation that welcomes different races, different religions and different views, and we are united by our respect for each other's humanity and for each other's right to live in peace. We are united by respect for one another and our right to live as citizens in this free society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all need to acknowledge the trauma on all sides. We all need to respect each other's humanity and to come together as peacemakers have done throughout history. We all need to be peacemakers. We gain nothing by reproducing the conflict here, by talking past each other, by shouting each other down and by insisting on respective absolutes. It is not acceptable for anyone in this country to blame others in this country for the actions of others overseas. We stand against discrimination in all its forms. We stand against hate speech and prejudice. I stand against prejudice, discrimination and hate speech, and I always have. People might recall a bipartisan motion moved by former senator Cormann and me, which we drafted, calling out Fraser Anning for his appalling first speech where he referenced the 'final solution'. People might recall the Labor Party in opposition applauding former senator Brandis in response to an event in this chamber which was targeting the Muslim community and the Muslim faith. We have been consistent in our position against antisemitism, against all forms of hate speech and against Islamophobia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Birmingham talks about—and he is right to raise this—how people are feeling. I would refer back to what I said when we announced our vote in support of a two-state solution at the UN. I sought to address the Jewish community directly. I said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Now I want to make some remarks directly to the Australian Jewish community. I understand that the Australian Jewish community are feeling distressed and isolated. I want to say, you are valued members of our community. You have a right to be safe. You have a right to feel safe. Anti-semitism has no place anywhere. I stand against it. We all must stand against it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly we have seen in this chamber and beyond the distress that so many Australians feel at what we are seeing in Gaza.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In respect of the issues that have been raised, our position is clear. We call for a humanitarian ceasefire, enabling the immediate release of hostages and humanitarian aid to flow. We call for the release of hostages. We have been clear about our objections to an Israeli ground offensive into Rafah. We have called for Israel to comply with the binding orders of the International Court of Justice, including to enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance at scale. We have been clear about our position on BDS. We do not support BDS. We've been clear about our position on weapons. Australia has not supplied weapons to Israel since this conflict began or in the last five years. But most of all we want to do what we can to break the cycle of violence. We want a two-state solution. The phrase 'From the river to the sea' is not consistent with a two-state solution. And it is that solution which is needed for the peace and security of Palestinians and Israelis alike.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Colleagues, Australia is not a central player in the Middle East, but we are a respected voice, and we use our voice to advocate for a humanitarian ceasefire, for the release of hostages and for a two-state solution, including by using our vote at the United Nations to add international momentum for a two-state solution. With that, I move:</span>

We recognise the State of Israel's ongoing illegal occupation of Palestinian territories, and the expropriation of Palestinian land and water is illegal and must be opposed. We call on, and have always called on, all parties to abide by international law, and we have recognised the reality that the policies of the State of Israel are increasingly rendering a two-state solution unachievable.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this work we have opposed all forms of racism, religious or cultural intolerance and discrimination in Australia and internationally. We have recognised that Palestinians in the State of Israel are subject to apartheid, while also recognising that there is, within Australia and across the world, a rise of antisemitism and Islamophobia that must be called out and that must be opposed, and that the attempt to frame criticism of the State of Israel's policies as antisemitic is utterly inappropriate. We do all of this while advocating peaceful and non-violent solutions. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time exp</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ired.)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent weeks we found out just how far this government is willing to go to avoid scrutiny and accountability and to keep the public in the dark about dodgy government actions. This is a government that works hard to hide its cruelty, to keep its violence out of sight and out of mind and to keep the truth hidden. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no better example of this than when it comes to questions about their complicity in the genocide in Gaza. Minister Wong and Prime Minister Albanese have continuously dodged questions about their government's ties with weapons companies that are fuelling Israel's genocide, and the hundreds of millions of dollars of public funds going to these companies. We know there are a number of ways that weapons make their way from this country to fuel genocidal massacres around the globe, including Israel's bombardment of Gaza. The weapons usually do not come directly from the Department of Defence. The global military industrial complex is much more sinister than that. Labor uses this complexity to dodge questions about all the ways that weapons produced in this country make their way to Gaza. The constant misrepresentation and intentional avoidance of questions is a deliberate attempt to mislead the public and avoid scrutiny. It's behaviour that constitutes contempt of the Senate. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">To be brief, I want to make it clear, as many ministers have in many different forums, that Australia has not supplied weapons to Israel since the conflict began and for at least the past five years. Australia has a stringent export control framework which is designed to ensure military and dual-use items are used responsibly outside of Australia. This framework requires the government to consider Australia's national interests and international obligations, including with regard to human rights, before issuing an export permit. As part of this process, Defence considers factors including the nature of the export, its proposed destination country and the proposed end user at that destination. Where there is a risk that issuing a permit could contravene our interests or obligations, that permit is refused. Defence continues to review the export permits it has granted to account for changes in the strategic environment and ensure that our exports continue to align with our international obligations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is party to and fully implements all major international arms control treaties, including the Arms Trade Treaty. Specifically, when Defence issues export permits for military or dual use, these are listed publicly on the Defence and Strategic Goods List. The supply of a weapon to Israel from Australia by the Australian government, an Australian company or an individual in Australia would require Defence to issue an export permit to allow it to leave our shores. The government can confirm that no weapons have been supplied to Israel for at least the past five years, because no export permits have been issued for weapons in that time.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PBR Act and the IPEA Act set out the framework for the provision and administration of resources for parliamentarians. The PBR Act commenced in 2018 and established a principles-based framework for the provision of public resources to senators and members of Parliament. The IPEA Act commenced in 2017 and established IPEA as an independent statutory authority. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">IPEA currently has functions relating to the provision of travel resources to current and former senators and members under the PBR Act and other legislation. This includes the administration of those resources (including processing claims, paying or providing resources and providing personal and general advice). IPEA's transparency and accountability functions include reporting and auditing resources and giving rulings relating to the public resources IPEA administers under the PBR Act. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">These changes to the parliamentary business resources framework have been developed in the context of the Government's broader reform activities to improve our parliamentary workplaces arising from the Australian Human Rights Commission's Set the Standard Report, including the establishment of the statutory Parliamentary Workplace Support Service and legislative amendments to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984</span> at the end of last year. An efficient and transparent administration regime that effectively supports parliamentarians to perform their duties in the public interest is an important feature of this system.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill is making three main changes to the legislative framework. Firstly, the Bill will provide for the transfer of the administration of certain PBR resources, including office expenses, from the Department of Finance to IPEA on 1 July 2025, implementing recommendation 23 of the Review. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Secondly, the Bill will implement recommendations 8 and 11 of the Review by extending IPEA's personal advice and rulings functions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Thirdly, the Bill will provide enhancements to the PBR Act and IPEA Act, to clarify certain provisions that have been identified as requiring amendment over time, and better support longstanding administrative practices under legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Parliamentarians and their staff have access to a range of resources, which are provided by multiple entities including the parliamentary departments, portfolio departments, as well as the Department of Finance and IPEA, under the PBR Act and other mechanisms. It is unlikely that there will ever be a single provider to administer of all resources that are necessary and appropriate for parliamentarians to undertake their parliamentary business. However, it is clear from the Review that there is room for improvement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The transfer and consolidation of the administration of most PBR resources within IPEA will result in IPEA becoming the key administrator and point of contact for advice and support, including in relation to parliamentarians' obligations under the PBR framework. This will simplify how services to parliamentarians and their staff are delivered. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The transfer will implement recommendation 23 of the Review and substantially advance the implementation of several recommendations which focus on aligning the administration of parliamentary business resources. This includes a greater focus on joined-up systems, administration, training, guidance and enhanced information sharing to improve the experience of parliamentarians and their staff (recommendations 13 to 17). </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The IPEA Act will be amended to provide that IPEA is responsible, by default, for all PBR administration except for resources that are expressly carved out. While some exclusions will be set out within the amended IPEA Act itself, the IPEA Act will be supported by legislative rules that will exclude other PBR resources from IPEA's administrative responsibilities as agreed by the Government. The legislative rules will provide flexibility to allow for efficient changes to the administration of PBR resources that may be required over time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The scope of IPEA's existing administrative and service delivery functions will be expanded to include office expenses and other transferred resources. This will build on IPEA's existing high standard of service delivery. However, the Bill will not reduce the types of resources provided to parliamentarians under the PBR Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">IPEA's responsibilities for reporting, compliance and audit for all work expenses will extensively align with existing practice. Currently, IPEA's personal advice function in relation to travel expenses and allowances are afforded exemption under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Information Act 1982</span> and safe-harbour from liability for a debt or penalty loading under the PBR Act. These important protections encourage parliamentarians' use of IPEA's advice function prior to claiming or using public resources, promoting the careful and appropriate use of public resources. The Bill will extend these protections to also cover the PBR resources which IPEA will administer following the transfer of functions. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will implement recommendations 8 and 11 of the Review. IPEA will have the authority to provide personal advice about staff use of travel resources to their employing parliamentarian. It will also allow IPEA to provide, with the parliamentarian's agreement, personal advice about a parliamentarian's use of resources it administers to that parliamentarian's staff. This will facilitate more effective and efficient communication between IPEA and a parliamentarian's office. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will implement Review recommendation 11 by allowing IPEA to make a ruling in relation to public resources it provided under the PBR Act when a former member was a member. Currently, the PBR Act does not allow IPEA to make a ruling for, or provide safe-harbour protections to, former parliamentarians. The Bill will allow IPEA to make a ruling in response to a request by a former member. This will provide assurance to current parliamentarians that if IPEA is found to have provided incorrect personal advice, the safe harbour protections that apply while a member, continue to apply after they cease to be a member. Under the amendments, IPEA will have the authority to make a ruling at the request of a former parliamentarian, but not at IPEA's own initiative. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will make a number of other amendments to the PBR Act and IPEA Act. These enhancements do not represent major policy changes, rather they aim to address gaps that have emerged, clarify or better align provisions to original policy intent, and better support longstanding administrative practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These measures include clarifying the delegation powers for Presiding Officers and IPEA's reporting function to align with administrative practices. Amendments to the PBR Act will ensure that the Prime Minister's power to determine resources relating to a former Prime Minister aligns with existing decisions of executive government which preceded the PBR Act. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will modernise the payment frequency for parliamentarians' remuneration. The Remuneration Tribunal will continue to determine and report on the annual salary amounts for parliamentarians and other remuneration elements. The Bill will facilitate remuneration being payable on a fortnightly (rather than monthly) basis. The commencement of this measure will be subject to the readiness of IT system updates required to enable this change. Consequential amendments to the relevant superannuation legislation will also be made to reflect this change to fortnightly payments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since 1980, ten members of Parliament have died while in office. Sadly, five of these, former Senators Alex Gallacher, Kimberley Kitching, Jim Molan and Linda White, and the former Member for Dunkley, Peta Murphy, have passed away in the last three years. These recent events have highlighted that allowances relating to a person ceasing to be a parliamentarian under the PBR Act are not payable to persons who pass away while a parliamentarian. This impacts the grieving partner and dependents of each of our former colleagues, as the provision of PBR resources stop with immediate effect upon a person leaving parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill seeks to recognise and redress this inequity by allowing the Remuneration Tribunal to determine allowances which would be payable to the estate of a person who dies while a parliamentarian. The Remuneration Tribunal would have the discretion to consider such factors as it considers relevant when determining what, if any, amount of estate allowance is appropriate. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will address an issue impacting retiring Territory Senators' remuneration which was inadvertently introduced with the PBR Act. The amendment will provide that a retiring Territory Senator is remunerated and able to claim PBR Act resources for the duration of their term when the Senate is not dissolved. The amendment will maintain the consistent and equal treatment of all retiring parliamentarians in the circumstances of a double dissolution election, whose remuneration ceases on the day of the double dissolution. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:00</span>):  I rise to speak on the Parliamentary Business Resources Legislation Amendment (Review Implementation and Other Measures) Bill 2024. Following the moving and passage of government amendments, the opposition will be supporting this bill, noting that the Special Minister of State has provided undertakings to the opposition on the intention of several measures in the bill and provided briefings on their operation, which we sincerely thank him for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill represents significant changes to the framework for parliamentary business resources. The bill would amend the Parliamentary Business Resources Act 2017, the PBR Act, and the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority Act 2017, the IPEA Act, to respond to a number of recommendations of the independent review into the Parliamentary Business Resources Act 2017 and the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority Act 2017, which is referred to in my comments as 'the review' and was conducted in late 2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill contains schedules that implement recommendations 8, 11 and 23 of the review. Recommendation 8 stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government consider amending the IPEA Act to expressly facilitate IPEA providing personal advice about staff use of travel resources to their employing parliamentarian and advice about parliamentarians' use of travel resources to their staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This change will allow for better access and practise of the correct use of expenses—something that we all agree on—in particular, giving clarity under the legislation as to who can receive this advice. Recommendation 11 stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government should consider amending the PBR Act to clarify that a former parliamentarian can apply for a ruling and IPEA can make such a ruling. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, these changes will ensure that, as the scheme is now seeing parliamentarians leave the parliament who were using resources under the PBR framework, those former parliamentarians can still access some of the benefits of IPEA's ability to make rulings after they have ceased being parliamentarians. It is an important change that will provide these individuals clarity, if required. Recommendation 23 stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government should consider moving the office expenses administration function to IPEA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This recommendation is a significant change. It represents the movement of a significant management of the resources for parliamentarians from the Department of Finance to the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority and will mean that, for the first time since the creation of the modern resources framework, the department will no longer manage the majority of the day-to-day resourcing for parliamentarians and their offices. Such a significant change will require an appropriate amount of education and management, to ensure staff and offices adjust to this change as smoothly as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The original bill proposed that this change would occur from 1 July this year, as the department advised that the most appropriate time to make the change is at the end of a financial year. The bill will also make minor and technical amendments to the conditions of our workplace, resolve administrative issues, make technical amendments and provide some measures that will modernise the systems that support parliamentarians in their work. Noting the significance of some of these changes and the short time originally proposed in the bill to introduce them, the government has indicated that some of these changes will take effect from 1 July 2025. This will allow for appropriate consultation and preparation to be undertaken to ensure officers and staff adjust to the new model of resource management. We sincerely thank the minister, his office and everyone involved in relation to these initiatives for their work—for continuing to work collaboratively on this bill and for continuing the longstanding bipartisanship on these matters.</span>

This is largely a machinery-of-government bill to change some expense reporting responsibilities from Finance to IPEA. IPEA is an independent body, and, therefore, we think those are good, positive changes and we support them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do still have concerns about the Prime Minister's boys' club—let's be honest; it is mostly a boys' club—in that this bill would codify what has not been longstanding practice: for current prime ministers to determine the ongoing perks of previous prime ministers. We think that is deeply inappropriate and we think that it is far more appropriate that that decision sit with the Remuneration Tribunal. They are the independent body that we think should make that sort of decision. I have circulated a second reading amendment to give effect to that suggestion. Sadly, I'm not anticipating support for that, but it's important that we go on the record. I move:</span>

I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:09</span>):  On behalf of the federal coalition, I can advise the Senate that we will be supporting the Agriculture Legislation Amendment (Modernising Administrative Processes) Bill 2024. Overall, it has our support because we believe that the amendments outlined in this legislation are sensible, responsible and practical. The bill will help to ensure that the Primary Industries Research and Development Act 1989 is modernised, upgraded and fit for purpose while also repealing an act that is no longer needed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From the outset, when it comes to the Primary Industries Research and Development Act 1989, it's important to recognise the major role that it has within Australia's primary production sector. The purpose of this act is to authorise and regulate four of our rural research and development corporations—we call them the RDCs. For more than three decades these RDCs, which include fisheries, cotton, grain and AgriFutures, have driven forward evidence based innovation, boosted strategic partnerships and helped secure targeted investment in each of their respective industries. They allow the federal government and primary producers to co-invest. I like to think it's the taxpayers and primary producers co-investing to make sure our primary production sector is fit for purpose by delivering the next generation of research but also making sure it delivers a return to the farm gate. That's a collective effort. Not just the entire industry but many communities throughout rural, regional and remote Australia will benefit. Therefore, it's essential that our RDCs operate as effectively and efficiently as possible, and we believe the measures contained within this bill do exactly that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Significantly, this legislation will enhance the operation of the Primary Industries Research and Development Act by improving the efficiency of administrative processes which relate to its governance and appointments. Amendments include streamlining and clarifying the nomination of RDC board members by a selection committee, which are then recommended to the minister for agriculture. It also removes the requirement for an annual report to be provided to the minister if no activity has been undertaken by the selection committee. Acknowledging that the RDCs meet twice annually, this bill will remove the requirement for the four statutory RDC chairpersons to have a coordination meeting each year. The coalition believes that that is a reasonable change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second major component of this bill includes repealing the outdated Rural Adjustment Act 1992 and making transitional provisions to allow information and documents held by the National Rural Advisory Council to be provided to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Given that the Rural Adjustment Scheme ceased in 1997, that all financial commitments were acquitted in the year 2000 and that the funding for the Farm Business Improvement Program ended in February 2008, repealing this act in 2024 just makes sense. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the federal coalition will be supporting this bill, and we commend it to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:14</span>):  I know the National Cancer Screening Register Amendment Bill isn't a controversial bill, but I just want to make a very brief contribution to the second reading debate. I'd like to offer some perspectives on this as someone who has been a longstanding advocate for patients of cancers with low survival rates and as the chair of the select committee that inquired into cancers with low survival rates. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to Cancer Australia, the five-year survival rate for lung cancer between 2015 and 2019 was only 24 per cent. In 2023 lung cancer accounted for 17 per cent, or about one in six, of all cancer deaths. Lung cancer has the unfortunate distinction of having both a high incidence and a low survival rate compared with other cancers, and this deadly combination gives lung cancer the highest mortality rate of any cancer in Australia. In 2023 this was an age-standardised rate of 33 deaths per 100,000 people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the issues the committee looked at was how the incidence and mortality of cancers compared to the funding they received from the NHMRC. The committee's report was tabled in 2017. At the time, lung cancer, which caused more deaths than any other cancer in Australia, was ranked ninth for NHMRC research funding. A number of submitters and witnesses to that inquiry highlighted the difficulties cancers with low survival rates have in attracting research funding. Among these difficulties is having a more limited research base, which makes it more difficult to design a study that will lead to a successful research grant proposal. More prominent cancers, which may have higher survival rates, typically attract more philanthropic funding and fundraising revenue because there are more patients and, obviously, more families and carers with a personal experience of those cancers. They are also more likely to attract commercial interest in treatment. These sources of funding—philanthropy, fundraising and commercial investment—help to establish the research base on which proposals for public funding can be put forward with the likelihood of success. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another observation of submitters and witnesses to the inquiry was the correlation between early detection, screening and diagnosis and increased rates of survival. An example put forward was that since 1990 the survival rate for breast cancer has increased from 60 per cent to over 90 per cent thanks, in large part, to screening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know we will hit a hard marker fairly soon, so the key message I want to get across is that, if we're going to improve outcomes for cancer patients overall, there needs to be a greater focus on the cancers that have the greatest impacts on the community, and lung cancer is definitely one of those. That is why I'm proud to be part of a government that is making this vital investment in lung cancer screening and expanding the National Cancer Screening Register to include lung cancer. The five-year year survival rate for lung cancer is 24 per cent, which means that a little over three in four patients will die five years after their diagnosis. We know that early detection means early intervention, and the screening program this bill enables is expected to save over 500 lives a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to finish by thanking the Minister for Health and Aged Care and his representative in this chamber, Senator Gallagher, for this initiative. I also thank Lung Foundation Australia for their hard work and advocacy, in particular their CEO, Mark Brooke, who's passionate about improving outcomes for lung cancer patients, their families and their carers. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Cancer Screening Register Amendment Bill 2024 amends the National Cancer Screening Register Act 2016 to add lung cancer as a third 'designated cancer' to the coverage of the register. The National Cancer Screening Register is national electronic infrastructure which currently supports the delivery of the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program and the National Cervical Screening Program. This bill will expand the register to include lung cancer screening along with bowel cancer and cervical cancer screenings. The new National Lung Cancer Screening Program was announced by the government last year and will allow screening to be available nationally to eligible individuals from July 2025. In line with Medical Services Advisory Committee advice, the NLCSP will target asymptomatic individuals aged 50 to 70 who have a history of cigarette smoking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition support this legislation—as we supported the establishment of the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program—as we strongly support the intention of this register and screening program to increase rates of early detection of lung cancer in Australia. This builds on the work of the coalition to support better lung cancer outcomes across our country. On World Cancer Day in 2019 the coalition announced that we were inviting Cancer Australia to conduct an inquiry into the prospects, processes and delivery of a national lung cancer screening program in Australia. Following this announcement, Cancer Australia launched a consultation hub through which organisations and individuals could make submissions about the proposal. The coalition provided our commitment to establishing a lung cancer screening program pending the results of this inquiry and the approval of the medical expert panel. The National Lung Cancer Screening Program that has now been announced by the government is the culmination of the coalition's announcement back in 2019—this is a case of the current government continuing the good work of the previous government—resulting from Cancer Australia's feasibility assessment, which reported back in May 2023, and a recommendation from the Medical Services Advisory Committee. We welcome the government's decision to continue the important work we started in government to establish a lung cancer screening program. It is great to see that the coalition's commitment to this goal has now been realised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition understood that early diagnosis is integral to improved lung cancer outcomes, including better survival rates and better quality of life. Early detection and intervention, as Senator Bilyk said, literally save lives. In line with the coalition's intentions, the National Lung Cancer Screening Program will target high-risk individuals to detect lung cancer in its early stages to increase the likelihood of successful treatment and improve lung cancer outcomes. To facilitate the delivery of the program, the National Cancer Screening Register will be expanded through this legislation to support patients with their screening pathway. The inclusion of the National Lung Cancer Screening Program is a welcome step in preventing and detecting lung cancer amongst Australians and ensuring better health outcomes. Once again, the coalition supports this bill.</span>

The coalition has sought assurances from the government that veterans will not be worse off under this legislation. The coalition supports the intent of the bill in its aims to establish a clear legal framework for means testing income from military invalidity payments affected by the Douglas decision. Following advice from the government and through the committee inquiry, it is the coalition's expectation that the vast number of veterans will not be worse off under this legislation. The coalition does, however, note concerns from stakeholders, including those stakeholders seeking clarification on whether the amendments in the bill would exclude military invalidity pension income streams from asset assessments in family law matters and how this bill will affect eligibility for family tax benefits, childcare subsidies or low-income health care.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Military Invalidity Payments Means Testing) Bill 2024 modifies the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to confirm how certain military invalidity pensions impacted by the Federal Court's Commissioner of Taxation v Douglas [2020] FCAFC 220 case are treated for income support. The legislation arises from the Douglas decision, which determined that specific invalidity benefits paid from the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme should be taxed as superannuation lump sums rather than as superannuation income streams, as previously assumed. The purpose of the bill is to establish a clear legal framework for means testing these payments when recipients also apply for support through Australia's income support system. The coalition supports the bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is now understood that, in light of the Douglas decision, the historical classification and treatment of these invalidity benefits in the means test can no longer be applied. The bill will introduce a new classification of military invalidity pension income stream in the Social Security Act and Veterans' Entitlements Act to include the military invalidity benefits affected by the Douglas decision. The assessment of the military invalidity pension income stream within the means test is designed to produce the same result as the historical assessments of the affected invalidity payments. This bill gives these veterans certainty about the assessment of payments for income support purposes. I commend the bill to the Senate, and I table an addendum to the explanatory memorandum related to this bill, the addendum being a response to matters raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee.</span>

This comes at a very critical time for our healthcare system because it's under such extraordinary pressure. It has never been harder or more expensive to see a GP in Australia, bulk-billing is collapsing and ramping has reached record levels at emergency departments across the country. We believe that this is necessary, but the Albanese government desperately needs to listen to Australia. It needs to understand the magnitude of the challenges that are before us, particularly when it comes to workforce because the budget on Tuesday night almost single-handedly ignored workforce.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the coalition will not stand in the way of this legislation. We will support it because it removes a barrier to Australians accessing primary care. But we would also like to put on the record that we believe that there is an absolute necessity for us to address, with a greater level of urgency, the issues around workforce. That's why the coalition will be moving an amendment that calls on the government to work with the states and territories to ensure nurse practitioners and midwives can work to their full scope of practice and to reduce any restrictions on their scope of practice at the state and territory level. I move:</span>

This bill will remove that legislative requirement, and it will enable a midwife or nurse practitioner to prescribe under the PBS and to provide services under Medicare.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the mandated collaborative arrangements currently in place, women are bearing the financial burden due to increased travel time and the cost of finding a GP who will provide a referral for midwifery care. This is even more problematic in rural and regional areas, where access to care is already limited. Removing these mandated collaborative arrangements is a very positive change for women's access to maternity care, sexual and reproductive health care and nurse led care. It's one that the Greens have supported for many years, and we're thrilled to see this legislation come to the chamber today. These are particularly important changes for women in rural and remote areas. We support this bill.</span>

This week, I authored a letter to the Prime Minister, which was co-signed by 13 other parliamentarians—and I thank them for their support—demanding that this Labor government walk away from the amendments and the treaty. </span>

The IHR amendments and the WHO pandemic treaty would transform the WHO from an advisory organisation into a supranational health authority, dictating how governments respond to emergencies which the WHO itself declares. The Prime Minister has the power to reject this power grab, and he must. </span>

When they were in government they undermined the system by ignoring billions of dollars in unpaid super and by forcing vulnerable Australians to raid their retirement savings during the pandemic. Now they're pushing on with their latest dud idea—forcing young people to raid their super to buy a house. It's a policy that experts say will increase prices and put homeownership even further out of reach. What their policy ignores is that the median super balance of a person under the age of 30 is less than $18,000. Young people don't want to raid what little super they have. They want to see their super and their wages growing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year I met with young workers from the SDA who shared with me the impact of what our current superannuation laws are having on their future, particularly laws that mean young workers under 18 do not receive super unless they work more than 30 hours per week. One worker, an 18-year-old from Queensland, told me that in her three years working in fast food and retail she would have earned almost $2,500 in super, but because she was under 18 she only received $100. She said, 'I did exactly the same job as those over 18. I work just as hard, yet I haven't been able to safeguard for my future like they have.' I also heard from a 17-year-old supermarket worker, who said, 'I started working at 15. Over the 18 months that I've worked, my superannuation is at $300. If the law was different, I would have over $1,800.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These young workers know how important it is to have a healthy superannuation for retirement, and so does our government. We've strengthened the system by including super in our wage theft laws and making changes to ensure that super is paid at the same time as wages. We are also helping to increase balances by paying super on government paid parental leave and by getting wages moving. We want workers to earn more and keep more of what they earn. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COX</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  This week's budget saw the government prioritise fossil fuels, property developers and defence over truth and treaty, increasing income support, and frontline family and domestic violence services. This budget was a betrayal of First Nations people, renters, students and disabled people, in the middle of a cost-of-living and climate crisis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First Nations people are still waiting for standalone cultural heritage legislation, while this government is handing out nearly $50 billion over the next 10 years to the fossil fuel industry to fast-track the destruction of country and our climate. Every day that we wait for this legislation, our sacred sites are under threat. Songlines, scar trees, sacred waterholes, rock art and ceremonial grounds are all under threat because of this Labor government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget lumps in funding for progressing these laws with reducing the backlog of complex cultural heritage claims under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, a flawed act that has on many occasions failed to provide essential protections to sacred and significant sites. A prime example of this is the recent destruction of Lee Point,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>on Larrakia land, by Defence Housing Australia. Minster Plibersek denied protection under this act, giving the green light for bulldozers to destroy sacred land, trees and an extremely important corridor for many birds in that area. I was lucky enough to see this beautiful area before it was shamefully destroyed. I want to commend the members of the community who fought so hard to protect Lee Point.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another betrayal is the stark absence of anything for truth and treaty in this budget, showing that this government has completely abandoned the Uluru Statement post referendum, once again leaving First Nations people with an empty, broken promise of progress for our people. Time and time again, First Nations people have had progress dangled in front of us, only for it to be discarded when it's no longer politically popular. Hawke did this with treaty, and this government has done it with the Uluru Statement and cultural heritage protections. This budget shows that this government has abandoned First Nations people.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DEAN SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  WA Labor MPs should be hanging their heads in shame this week. In a week that confirmed just how dependent Australia is on Western Australia's traditional industries, we learnt, in one day, how damaging Labor's policies are proving to be to the state of Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Murray Watt, finally mustered the courage to set a date to end live exports. But yesterday he got a taste of what's to come from Western Australian farmers, when the National Farmers Federation chose to walk out on Murray Watt's speech. Labor's decision to end exports by 2028 will cost as many as 3,000 jobs. We will not take it lying down. Generations of farmers have built an important and vital industry for Western Australian regional communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the same day as Murray Watt's unsuccessful speech, we learnt that Santos now intends to cut as many as 200 jobs in Perth. Make no mistake: this is absolutely attributable to Labor's preference for activism over the economy and working lives. Santos cited a delay in approvals—like those faced by their Barossa LNG project, which has faced years of court delays—for these 200 job cuts. Right now, Woodside's multibillion-dollar Scarborough gas project is also tied up in green lawfare. Can we expect a similar decision from Woodside in the months to come? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight, Peter Dutton and the coalition will offer a clear alternative. Instead of job losses, broken farming communities and dwindling investment, Peter Dutton and the coalition will ensure that mining and farming prosper in Western Australia. The answer is not a line of tax credits for comfortable miners; instead, it's about a genuine commitment to a pro-Western Australian mindset, built on the back of cutting lengthy approval times.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  I rise to congratulate all the early childhood educators in this country, who have been campaigning for respect and recognition for their absolutely essential work in the Big Steps campaign: educators who have told their stories over and over again; who've spoken out about how they love their jobs, but just can't stay in them, earning just half the average wage; and who've told us how educators are leaving the sector in droves because love for their work doesn't pay for their bills. I congratulate those educators who've come to Canberra again and again and again, who've taken to the streets and who've stood up and spoken out. They stood up for themselves to advocate for a wage that reflects the skill, complexity and value in the work that they do, and stood up for the children that they are educating, who need to see the exodus of early educators from the sector stop. I congratulate all of you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Tuesday night in the budget the Treasurer, Jim Chalmers, acknowledged you too. Our government has put the care economy front and centre. We want secure and well-paid jobs in early education and care. So the government has made provision for a well-deserved wage increase for early childhood educators. We know this will help bring more educators back to the sector, giving even more children the best start in life. Congratulations for advocating for yourselves. Congratulations, too, for advocating for the children in your care. You deserve a pay rise. Keep up the great work.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  The Prime Minister has declared that domestic violence is a national crisis. A woman is being murdered every four days. Thirty-five women have been murdered so far this year. I think Australians are expecting that the PM will step up and give frontline services the funding they actually need because it is, as he says, a crisis. But this chickenfeed, bandaid budget in most cases doesn't do more than keep the lights on. Community legal centres turned away a thousand people a day last year. The Tasmanian women's legal service are turning a woman away every day because they just do not have enough lawyers because they do not have the funding. The funding announced in the budget only provides for CPI and adjustments to under 20 per cent of their funding base. Like I said, it's chickenfeed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has said over and over again that he wants to change attitudes. But there are programs for men, for perpetrators of domestic violence—they want to get help and they want to change, but they are being turned away because the programs don't have the funding so there is no availability. And, if you really want to break the cycle, we need to be working on the next generation. Where was the money in this budget for programs to address the issues coming up for our kids—programs like the veteran mentors who work to put kids back on the right path? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My worry is that this budget isn't about fixing the domestic violence crisis, it isn't about lifting the 3.3 million Australians out of poverty, it isn't about helping our kids get mental health support and it isn't about dealing with youth crime. It isn't about giving our seniors the opportunity to work more hours not just to top up their pensions but also because it's great for their mental health and wellbeing. Do you know what this budget is about, Australians? Do you know what it's about? Same stuff, different day. It's about the Labor Party looking after their donors and putting their own careers before the national interest. It's not a budget for Australians; it's a budget to soften up voters for an early election, and that's all it is.</span>

That's the average Australian household with a mortgage. Why? Because of the cost-of-living crisis because of high inflation feeding into higher interest rates. How does the budget that was just brought down this week address it? It doesn't. It doesn't address it. It makes it worse. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't have to just listen to me as a senator in this place. Listen to one of Australia's most renowned economists, Mr Chris Richardson. This is what he had to say—an economist, not a politician: 'My key test for the budget was that it not poke the inflationary bear. I don't think it's passed that test. I've consistently been saying for a long time that I didn't see a rate cut until the end of this year, but that's starting to slip into next year. It looks harder to get one ahead of the election.' That's Mr Chris Richardson, one of Australia's most renowned economists. And that's bad news for your average Australian household with a mortgage. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So not only did this budget poke the inflationary bear; it actually gave the inflationary bear a punch on the nose. Tragically, it is going to be Australian households who pay the price for that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  It is my pleasure to rise today and place on the parliamentary record news of the recent election of my friend Emily McMillan to the position of assistant national secretary of the mighty Transport Workers Union. A proud First Nations woman, Emily is the first woman to take on this role. I couldn't be more proud of her elevation to this position and of her contribution to the union movement and the road transport industry. After serving eight years as chief of campaigns at the national office of the TWU, Emily was recently endorsed by the national committee of management and elected unopposed to this role by the national council at its meeting in Fremantle last week. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over two decades in the union movement, Emily has worked in a variety of public and private sector unions in industrial organising and campaigning roles. In her time as chief of campaigns at the TWU, Emily led the TWU's organising and campaign plans, which included a period of mass protected industrial action to make transport jobs more secure; the creation of the aviation campaign to rebuild jobs, pay and conditions after the pandemic; and a member-led recruitment campaign which has welcomed roughly 10,000 new members in the target areas of retail and aviation over the last two years. Most recently and most importantly, she led and won the campaign for transport reform through member-led national days of action, convoys, vigils, lobbying trips to Canberra and, of course, Senate inquiries. From my heart, and from Fiona's as well, Emily, congratulations. I look forward to continuing to work with you in your new role as the National Assistant Secretary of the mighty Transport Workers Union. We've got your back, sister.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  This Sunday, hundreds will gather at the town hall in Sydney to mark and acknowledge that it's 15 years since the brutal Mullivaikkal massacre that occurred during the closing stages of the war on Tamil Eelam in Sri Lanka. In May 2009, Mullivaikkal, an internationally declared no-fire zone, was attacked, and tens of thousands of Tamils, many civilians, many under the cover of the Red Cross, were killed by the Sri Lankan military. A hundred and seventy thousand Tamils were killed in the closing years of that brutal conflict.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people responsible for these crimes remain in senior positions of leadership within the Sri Lankan military and government. To this day Tamils are still unsafe and fear persecution, and many have sought refuge in other countries, including Australia. Our nation should open our hearts to those Tamils who are here and give them a permanent, welcoming home. We will not forget, and May 2024 marks a moment for the mourning of the dead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday I was honoured to meet with Farhad Bandesh and Piumi Kaneshan, people who came to Australia seeking to build a better life and instead have been met with cruelty by this government. The most recent round of cruelty is the Albanese Labor government's Trump-style travel ban and antirefugee bill. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can say this clearly: for Farhad Bandesh and Piumi Kaneshan and the thousands of others who are being threatened by the bill, this is their home. The Albanese government went into the last election saying they were going to be a different kind of government than the coalition. We now know that actually that means a crueller government, one that deliberately whips up fear and division against and amongst multicultural communities in a cynical attempt to hide their own failings. It won't work. Across the board, the community is saying clearly that this appalling bill and Labor's toxic politics that fester in their conflict with the coalition in this space need to end.</span>

Countless more are assaulted, hurt, raped, scared, trapped. Although black women are the most impacted by this violence, we are never seen as the experts on our own experiences. Missing from all of the recent conversations about gendered violence are the voices of black women. Without our voices being centred in this conversation, we cannot dismantle systems of violence.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that more police and prisons have never reduced violence or made women safer, especially not black women and our families. We know that this government has created deep poverty and inequality in this country, which is only growing. Poverty plus the same old colonial gendered and racial violence are a deadly mix, leaving women trapped in dangerous situations, unable to leave, as funding cuts for vital services leave them with nowhere to run.</span>

In the words of Afrida Imrose, policing is never going to fix what is essentially a public health crisis—especially when police are some of the greatest perpetrators and enablers of femicide. It is urgent and necessary to force our governments to reckon with how they are making things worse.</span>

It's now believed that 36 of those 128 still missing are dead, but their families don't know because they are held by a terror organisation who committed the most vile atrocities and who continue to call for the genocide of the Jewish people and the Israeli population, and for the destruction of Israel.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  Overnight the Prime Minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico, was shot in an attempted assassination. He's in a critical condition. On behalf of One Nation, I send our prayers to the Prime Minister and hope for his speedy recovery and return to work. Slovakia has only just returned the Fico government, on a platform that stood out against globalist influence on Slovakia from the EU and the United States.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This platform includes opposing the World Health Organization pandemic treaty, opposing the international health regulation amendments and any measure that takes away Slovakian sovereignty. Clearly, the attempt on the Prime Minister's life is the work of someone who feels the Slovakian people should not be allowed to break away from the controlled state being constructed in Europe and make their own way in the world, just as their neighbour Hungary has done under Prime Minister Orban.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">President-elect Peter Pellegrini called the shooting an 'unprecedented threat' to democracy and warned against expressing political opinions with pistols in squares instead of voting in polling stations, a sentiment true for our divided country. As Churchill said, 'The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.' Prime Minister Fico displayed such vigilance in standing against unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats in Brussels, Geneva, London, Europe and New York. Australia must be vigilant against the continued subversion of our democracy by these same people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Prime Minister Albanese, Australia has seen a procession of bills designed to subvert Australian democracy. Today we see yet another guillotine. Thursdays have become 'guillotine Thursday' as the government rams one freedom-destroying bill through after another to avoid oversight. Indeed, as we speak, the government is doing exactly that with the Digital ID Bill in the House of Reps. The Senate is the house of review. This government, the Greens and some crossbench senators are making a mockery of our solemn duty. One Nation wants to know who's pulling this government's strings. It's clearly not the Australian people.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  Labor's budget betrays all of those in Australia who are doing it tough. Instead of tackling the housing crisis in affordability, increasing JobSeeker and fully funding the frontline services women need to escape violence, this government is giving property investors $175 billion in tax concessions, locking young people out of the housing market. They're giving fossil fuel corporations $50 billion in subsidies, literally paying to further fuel a climate catastrophe. They're giving wealthy people a $4½ thousand tax cut while keeping the unemployed in poverty. Their cost-of-living solutions are window-dressing for the millions who can't cover the increasing costs of rent, food, fuel and debt right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of this, Labor's budget offers too little to women. Instead of fully funding frontline services for women fleeing violence, they've just rebadged an existing program. Their budget betrays renters and ignores the housing crisis. Labor's offering an extra $9 a week to around 20 per cent of renters, while rents are expected to go up by an average of $46 a week over the next 12 months. Renters in Adelaide have just experienced the biggest rent increase across our nation. They were looking for more help in this budget. If the government had introduced a rent freeze in 2022, when it was first proposed by the Greens, Australian renters would have saved an average of $3,067 by now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget betrays students. The government has promised to shave some indexation off the top of student debts, but this still leaves millions of young people with a lifetime of repayments. Labor has to stop rewarding the big end of town with fuel subsidies and tax breaks that are only making the climate crisis, the housing crisis and the crisis facing women in violent households worse. There is, indeed, a hole at the centre of this budget, and a few bandaids are nowhere near what's needed to fix it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  As most, if not all, senators in here will know, I have an abiding interest in national security. One of our greatest vulnerabilities with regard to our national security is fuel security. Australia has only 30 days of liquid fuels onshore. In the event of an outbreak of war, we wouldn't even need to be involved to be brought to our knees. That's why I was pleased to see money being made available for low-carbon fuels in the Future Made in Australia program in the budget the other night—that is, sustainable aviation fuels as well as biodiesel. This is an important initiative and one that needs to be taken as seriously as the production of renewable energy via solar panels or wind, or through the production of hydrogen. This is a vulnerability that Australia cannot live with and we should not be looking at doing anything but accelerating how we address it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the RAAF's target is to have 65 per cent SAF by 2050. Surely the ADF can be more ambitious in having a target for all its fuel use much faster? I call on them to be able to do it by 2030. This not only is going to increase our security as a nation but also will bring about the ability for our farmers to have another industry to sell their produce into. The resilience that we build in our farm sector is equally as important as our ability to protect our nation from this vulnerability.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  Over the last two years I've had the privilege of travelling across the regions in my home state of Victoria and talking to our diverse communities. In the Mallee I've met passionate people who are working hard to build a bright and prosperous future for their families. Having grown up in the Mallee, I personally know the value of an honest day's work and the can-do attitude of our regions.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government values hard work and we invest in it. We're delivering targeted cost-of-living relief to ease the immediate pressures faced by regional families and businesses. On 1 July this year the Albanese Labor government will deliver a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer, not just some. This includes 67,000 people in the Mallee. The average tax cut for taxpayers in the Mallee will be $1,283. And on 1 July 2024 more than 10 million households will receive a total rebate of $300 and eligible small businesses will receive $325 for their electricity bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're putting regional Victoria at the centre of our budget by supporting thriving regions through our investments in infrastructure, jobs and skills. The Albanese government is funding infrastructure in the Mallee, including an additional $8.3 million for the Horsham Junction upgrade; $1 million for the Ballarat to Ouyen intersection upgrade; and $1.2 million for the upgrade of the intersection between Stawell and the South Australian border. This brings our total five-year investment in local roads in the Mallee to $153 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People will also hear very soon about the Growing Regions Program, and I hope there will be good news for locals in the Mallee. Labor governments have a strong record of boosting local manufacturing, harnessing economic opportunities and making our regions more productive. Our $22.7 billion plan for a Future Made in Australia will secure a future of well-paid jobs in the Mallee.</span>

This is the Attorney-General who is spending a billion dollars to change one letter—to go from the AAT to the ART: $1 billion! The letter 'R' has become the most expensive letter in the alphabet! But of course this is the Attorney-General who has the odious honour of being the first law officer, the first person, to be referred to the NACC for allegations of corruption. Shame on the Attorney-General! He's the first law officer and the worst law officer of this country.</span>

I thank our consul-general and all of the staff at the Australian Consulate-General in Noumea for their work supporting Australians in New Caledonia. I take this opportunity to repeat Australia's call for calm. We respect and support the referendum process under the Noumea Accord and the discussions underway between all parties.

Australians needed a budget that addressed the causes and not the symptoms of Labor's homegrown inflation by increasing the supply of energy and housing. Instead, Australians got a budget that, in the words of independent economists, was 'extremely expansionary', 'smoke and mirrors' and 'a political trick'. Minister, isn't your budget simply a political sugar hit, rather than addressing inflation at the source—a bandaid on a bullet wound?</span>

I think yesterday I used the word 'audacious' for one of the questions I got asked by the opposition. But, really, honestly, to come in here and ask that after everything this government, in two years, has done on stabilising the energy system in this country, driving renewable energies after decades and—how many policies was it; 22 policies? You had 22 policies and not one of them landed. You wasted a decade fighting amongst yourselves rather than putting the nation's interest at heart and front of mind. That is what we have done, since the moment we came to government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If there are two stark areas where we have been the opposite of how you behaved in government, wasting a decade, it is energy and housing. In two years, what we have done in terms of energy policy, in terms of energy bill relief, in terms of the caps—all of that you voted against. On the Housing Australia Future Fund, how did you vote on that? You opposed it. Everything we have done to increase housing supply in this country after a decade of no interest from the Commonwealth other than a suggestion—which we might see again tonight—to ransack super so that young people don't leave with any retirement savings and so that you inflate housing prices across Australia. We'll see that rejigged tonight, no doubt.</span>

That energy bill relief will put downward pressure on inflation, as will the assistance we're providing through Commonwealth rent assistance, which was overlooked by those opposite. You didn't really care about the people who rely on Commonwealth rent assistance when you were in government. We have increased it twice in two years, the first time that that's been done in 30 years. That provides much-needed assistance to those households and puts downward pressure on inflation. We're also capping the price of medicines so those who rely on medicines won't have any increased costs there.

So all this rubbish that they go over about how we are exacerbating inflation—we have halved it! The quarter with the highest inflation was under your government. We have been dealing with this every single day since we came to government. We have found savings in the budget. We have delivered two surpluses—well, one and we have another one in sight.

He, like every senator on our side, understands the importance of Medicare. We are the party of Medicare, and Labor is the party of stronger Medicare. That is who we are. Tuesday's budget only reinforces that fact. We on this side understand that Medicare goes to the heart of who we are as Australians. We understand that everyone deserves access to affordable health care, to accessible health care, to quality health care. This is why we have announced we will be funding 29 more Medicare urgent care clinics across the country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, in South Australia, I visited the Marion urgent care clinic with the fantastic member for Boothby from the other place. I saw firsthand the role of these clinics in taking pressure off our emergency departments and in making care more affordable and more accessible to more Australians. This is a good thing. This is another good policy those opposite don't support. Not only have we established more than 50 of these clinics; there are more on the way. In this budget and in previous budgets you've seen Labor's commitment to stronger Medicare, tripling the bulk-billing incentive. We've made medicines cheaper, also opposed by those opposite, and we are freezing the cost of PBS medicines.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite might remember that Tuesday's budget was 10 years on from the infamous 2014 budget—10 years on from what might have been Mr Dutton's only real idea when it comes to health care. His one idea as health minister? Make Australians pay more, tax medicines, tax patients going to hospitals and impose a GP tax. That's what Mr Dutton really thinks about Medicare. No surprise that this bloke was voted by Australia's doctors as the worst health minister in a decade. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Aspiring homeowners were the biggest losers in Tuesday night's budget. There is no support for first home buyers or any initiatives to address the drain on supply. Labor remains blind to the impact of record levels of migration and booming construction costs, which are locking Australians out of the housing market. IFM Investors's chief economist, Alex Joiner, says 'the overwhelming consensus' of economists is that the budget drives inflation, which will hurt aspiring and current homebuyers by keeping interest rates higher for longer. Why did Labor have no policies at all that support homeownership in this budget?</span>

                  </a>  I welcome the question. I thank Senator Bragg for giving me the opportunity to talk about the Homes for Australia Plan. It may have passed him by as he was developing, hand in hand with the Leader of the Opposition, a rehash of the super raid that he'd like to see young people forced to do to get into homeownership, which we expect we will see tonight—a rehash of an old idea that will do nothing to enable younger Australians to get into homeownership. I can talk to you about all of the initiatives.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the next six years, we will be investing around $32 billion in a range of programs, including programs that support people into homeownership, like the shared equity Help to Buy scheme, like the regional homeownership scheme—which I think has been so successful. In addition to that, we're driving supply of new housing across the country, working with states and territories. Maybe Senator Bragg didn't see that we put more money in to get more homes built sooner, working with states and territories. I know it's something that those opposite never did in government. They always liked to divide and have fights with states and territories, but we find that it's much more productive for the Australian people if we are able to work with those that make decisions about planning to build more houses.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no government in the history of the Federation that has done more and is doing more to drive housing supply in this country. We have our eye on this—this is a major challenge, one that we inherited after a decade of absolutely no action from those opposite—whether it be supportive accommodation, whether it be accommodation for women, whether it be looking at ways to support the provision of rental accommodation, whether it be assistance through Commonwealth Rent Assistance and more. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

There is housing being opened almost every week, across this country, thanks to some of the programs that the Commonwealth has supported, including that we're helping more than 110,000 people into their own homes through the expanded Home Guarantee Scheme. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired )</span></span>

Minister, Labor's budget entrenches economic inequality and exacerbates the climate crisis. It does little to help people getting smashed by cost-of-living pressures but lines the pockets of Labor's corporate donors—property developers, banks, coal and gas corporations and supermarket giants. Why have you locked in obscene levels of expenditure on things like AUKUS, tax cuts for the rich and subsidies for burning fossil fuels, rather than raising the rate of JobSeeker and youth allowance, capping rents, wiping student debt or putting dental and mental health into Medicare? How can you justify a budget that so clearly prioritises corporate greed over people doing it tough and the health of our planet's climate and ecosystems?</span>

I think it's not an unexpected question from the Greens political party, who see things in such black-and-white ways.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have, in this budget, focused our priority on cost-of-living relief. We have done, over three budgets, more than, I think, any government—certainly in recent times—around improving payments, responding on rent assistance, making child care cheaper and expanding Medicare so that more people can see a doctor without paying. Our urgent care clinics have been used, with around 400,000 presentations to those clinics, where people don't have to pay. The work we have done in medicines, to keep medicines low, and the work we're doing in housing, to generate crisis, affordable and social housing, is all aimed at people doing it tough.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the shift to renewable energy, I would have thought that there were things in this budget that would have got a bit of an applause from the Greens political party—the shifting of focus with the Future Made in Australia, under the 'renewable energy superpower', to try and promote new industries, new jobs and new opportunities in clean energy, with hydrogen and critical minerals. This is the first budget that puts a serious investment in those new energy sources, and we have not changed any arrangements. Listening to your question, it's like we've found new money to put into older industries or new areas. That's not true. There are areas under the tax system which remain in place. But, at the same time, we are trying to incentivise new jobs and seize the opportunities that come with a shift to a net zero economy. I would have thought that, even if you named all the other areas, you would support at least that area in this budget.</span>

I'm sure that those here would have to recognise that, in the two years that we have been here, we have done more not only to support the transition to net zero but to address climate change and to deal with some of the challenges that we've inherited in the environment department and in the environment policy space that had, again, been left unattended after a decade of wasted time; it was not addressing the issues that the Australian people face. We are doing this. Every single budget we tried to shift the dial— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We have outlined our plans in relation to tax reform. There are a number of those bills that currently sit before the Senate. That is our focus. Of course, the main priority was to get the tax cut legislation, with every Australian getting a tax cut on 1 July this year. That has been our focus. It remains our focus with the bills that are before the parliament. In relation to some of the work that has been happening on the supermarket front, which I think is the other part of Senator McKim's question, there are a number of pieces of work underway, including the work that the consumer group CHOICE is doing around providing transparency and comparison reports on a quarterly basis for the next three years. There's the work that Dr Craig Emerson has done, the work that the ACCC is doing and the work that the Senate is doing as well.</span>

The Treasurer has said that this is a budget designed to help people while also setting Australians up for the future. We just heard from Minister Wong earlier about the important cost-of-living measures contained in the budget. Can you update the Senate on how the Albanese Labor government is setting Australians up for the future? And, Minister, how will the government's Future Made in Australia policy gear up the Australian economy to grow into the future?</span>

I know that people in Western Australia will be looking closely at the plans that the government has outlined in the budget. The Albanese government believes in planning for the future and creating opportunities for all Australians to benefit from the huge economic and energy transformation that the world is currently undertaking. The government's Future Made in Australia package is all about encouraging and facilitating the private sector investment required for Australia to succeed and become an indispensable part of that future global economy. A Future Made in Australia, as the Treasurer said yesterday, will maximise our geological, meteorological, geographical and geopolitical advantages, making more things here, creating secure, well-paid jobs and responding to the net zero transition that offers so many opportunities for all Australians. A Future Made in Australia will attract investment in renewable hydrogen, green metals, critical minerals, solar and batteries. It will make Australia a renewable energy superpower, it will strengthen economic resilience and security, it will back Australian innovation and science and it will invest in people and places where this transition will take place.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our policy includes production tax credits for renewable hydrogen and processed critical minerals. It involves investment in the Australian Renewable Energy Agency that's been so successful despite the attempts to shut it down from those opposite. The Future Made in Australia innovation fund, the $1 billion Solar Sunshot and $500 million Battery Breakthrough Initiative, the quantum computing investment and a range of other reforms will accelerate approvals. We know that this country can be a renewable energy superpower—solar, wind, green hydrogen—and harness the cleaner and cheaper energy that can come from the power of a new generation of manufacturing. </span>

Where are all those nuclear reactors going to go? Whose electorate are those nuclear reactors going to go in? While the pressure is on, while we're planning for a future as part of the global transition to net zero, we've got the opposition I think working on their 23rd or 24th energy policy, and they still haven't even been able to land that.

This week's budget announced payments for students doing mandatory practical placements in teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work courses. Students have told me how hard it is for them to take on these mandatory placements, which can see them do months of work for no money. They're forced to choose between finishing their degree and paying their rent. But this policy doesn't do anything to trim the amount of government money going to universities for placement units. Minister, why does your paid placement policy ask taxpayers to pay for student training yet doesn't put any of the responsibility on the universities?</span>

I'm glad you asked this, because this is an issue that so many younger Australians are facing when undertaking their university studies. We know that many university courses do require students to undertake a placement as part of their degree. The types of courses I'm particularly thinking about are nursing, teaching, social work and like courses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Universities Accord review that the government commissioned—which Minister Clare commissioned—made recommendations that we fund students to undertake those practice placements. That's exactly the recommendation we followed. I'm not aware of the accord review having recommended that the responsibility be put on universities in the way that you're suggesting. Really, in the end, the reason we have followed this recommendation is that what happens in practice is that students who, for instance, give up their part-time job or their full-time job in order to undertake that practice placement end up out of pocket. In many cases, that's  deterring them from undertaking those courses. I'm sure you'll agree with us on this, Senator Tyrrell: Australia needs more people with more qualifications. We need more people with university degrees and we need more people with TAFE qualifications, because the jobs of the future, increasingly, are going to require formal qualifications like those. And we don't want to see a system going on that actually deters students from undertaking really important courses like nursing, teaching, social work et cetera simply because they can't afford to undertake that practical component.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this is a really great measure contained in this year's budget, and I commend Minister Clare for acting on that recommendation. I'm very confident that it will encourage more of those students to pursue those careers into the future.</span>

As I said, I'm not aware, as the representing minister, of whether the accord review had anything specific to say on that point. But I would surmise that the reality is that, while students do undertake that kind of practical training outside the university environment—it might be in a classroom, it might be in a hospital or it might be in another environment—there's still a requirement on universities to supervise. That's not on a day-to-day basis but to check in, to moderate the course and to assess the student's performance. So there is still a requirement on universities to deliver some kind of service to the students and to the employer who is hosting that student in a practical environment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise the point you're making, but it's not without cost to universities. Of course, you would have seen in our announcements this week that we do expect universities to provide a high-quality education to students at an affordable price. Some of the measures that we've undertaken will help to deliver that.</span>

As I may have said in my answer to your primary question, the Universities Accord review did recommend that government should fund support for students undertaking nursing, care and teaching professions courses, and employers—public and private—should provide funding for other fields. We do expect employers to be able to provide funding towards students who are undertaking other courses, but, really, this comes back to the recommendations of the Universities Accord review. As I understand it, the reason for their recommendation was that training to enter care and teaching professions needs to be accessible. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Earlier today, you voted to agree that the slogan 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free' opposes Israel's right to exist, is a call for the abolition of the State of Israel and is frequently used by those who seek to intimidate Jewish Australians via acts of antisemitism. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tragically, this phrase is increasingly being used in Australia and elsewhere as part of an unprecedented wave of antisemitism. The Prime Minster has agreed that this is a very violent statement and that it doesn't have a place in our political debate. However, yesterday, Senator Payman, a Labor senator, proudly repeated this very phrase in front of assembled media. Has the Prime Minister now spoken with Senator Payman about her use of the phrase and asked, or demanded, that she retract it? What apology and other action has he demanded of her? </span>

The First Nations legal sector, which is under hugely increased demand, as you know, needed $229 million in the budget to ensure they can continue to deliver their critical services, including assisting women and children escaping domestic violence. The $15 million in your budget is shamefully inadequate and is an insult to our people and the sector. Will the federal government increase funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services this year beyond the measly $15 million in the budget?</span>

I'll answer this question in a couple of ways. The legal services that you're talking about are, of course, covered by the broader National Legal Assistance Partnership agreement that the government has. We do as a government recognise the pressures that legal assistance services are under, whether it be Aboriginal legal services or more broadly. We definitely support and note the importance of strengthening this sector because, of course, legal assistance is essential to ensuring access to justice and equality before the law. That is exactly why the Albanese government announced in this budget $44.1 million of urgent funding for 2024-25 to help legal assistance providers address current resource and workforce issues until the new National Legal Assistance Partnership agreement commences on 1 July 2025.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Legal Assistance Partnership between the Commonwealth and all states and territories is a five-year agreement to fund vital legal assistance services for the most vulnerable Australians. As I understand it, one of the ways in which that funding will be used will be to index the wages of the very hardworking staff in those legal services, many of whom I know personally. That's the first way in which we're dealing with the issues that you've raised, Senator Thorpe. The second way, of course, is through the ongoing funding that we're providing for Indigenous justice initiatives. Achieving justice targets under the National Agreement on Closing the Gap is a key priority for the Albanese government, and it is vital—</span>

They're exactly the kinds of services that you're asking about, Senator Thorpe. That funding includes $16.9 million to provide an indexation boost to legal aid commissions, community legal centres and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services for the last year of the Legal Assistance Partnership, in addition to $27.2 million for crisis funding. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Prime Minister has said that helping Australians with cost-of-living relief is the government's No. 1 priority. I note that Tuesday's budget included tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer, provided new energy relief, invested in affordable housing, delivered cuts to student debt, strengthened Medicare and delivered cheaper medicines to Australians. How does the Albanese Labor government's budget help Australians earn more and keep more of what they earn, and why is it important that Australians receive the cost-of-living support that was outlined in the budget?</span>

There have been some other good questions, but that's an absolute cracker. This budget is responsible and restrained, which eases cost-of-living pressures, puts downward pressure on inflation and invests in a future made in Australia. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight, of course, it is the opposition's turn to set out their plan for Australia. We've seen a lot of noes from Mr Dutton and the opposition, but Australians now want to know what he will say yes to. We know what the Albanese government is for. We're for more cost-of-living help, including energy bill relief for every household and a tax cut for every taxpayer. But where does Mr Dutton stand on that? Will he back that in tonight? It is really hard to know where Mr Dutton and the coalition stand on these issues, given the reactions of their colleagues over the last few days.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of days ago on <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span>, Mr Taylor, the shadow Treasurer, was asked if he will support the government's cost-of-living relief going to Australian households. Mr Taylor said, 'Sure.' But the next morning, on ABC NewsRadio, Mr Littleproud, the temporary Leader of the Nationals, was asked about energy price relief, and he said, 'No, I think it should have been means-tested.' So we're yes one day and we're no the next. We're yes when we're a Liberal; we're no when we're a National.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hume, the shadow finance minister, backed him in the same day when she said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, unfortunately, Senator Hume couldn't even last 24 hours before contradicting herself, because the next day she was on TV, saying:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Well, everybody needs $300 off their power bill. In fact, we'd like to see more.</span>

For starters, under Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, all 13.6 million Australian taxpayers will get a tax cut. But we know that, under Mr Dutton and the Liberals, those tax cuts would be taken away. It wasn't that long ago that Senator Hume, as the shadow finance minister, was saying about the tax cuts, 'We'll have to go back to the drawing board.' Well, tonight's the night for the drawing board to come out of the closet! Tonight's the night. Under Labor, wages growth is up, which is helping Australians earn more and keep more of what they earn. We know Mr Dutton wants to strip back workers' rights and force Australians to work longer for less.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our cost-of-living plan has been widely endorsed, even on radio station 2GB, where Chris O'Keefe this week said: 'I reckon it is pretty good. I don't see what the issue is with giving every household $300 off their power bills. It's one of the great misnomers that the coalition are better economic managers.' Imagine being Mr Dutton, turning up for a weekly cuddle with Ray Hadley on 2GB, and then his own announcers turn around and stab him in the back.</span>

We still don't. Another six months have passed—no laws. It sounds like we won't be having those laws in parliament this term either. A broken promise—but, hey, let's not worry about it. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A National Environmental Standard for First Nations engagement and participation in decision-making will be developed as a priority. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's such a priority that nearly two years can pass and we have nothing. Senator Thorpe is rightly angered by this, and I support her in that. It goes on:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will ensure that First Nations interests and cultural heritage are identified early and can be protected as projects are designed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I emphasise the word 'early'. That's not happening. It says, 'These will ensure that cultural heritage is identified and protected early,' providing certainty to traditional owners. Well, there is no certainty because there are no standards. No work has been done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In estimates in October last year I was wondering what was going on, giving the government the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they were getting some work done. I asked a senior official from the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water where things were at. I said, 'Is there a chance that what we are talking about here, the standards that were so critically important to have out the door and in place, will be done before the next election?' The official, a deputy secretary in the department, said, 'It's unclear.' Not even those who are notionally doing this work on this critically important piece of policy could tell us when work would be done. It won't be done before the election, in much the same way that the national environmental laws won't before the election. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I go to this ridiculous claim of public interest immunity, the suggestion in the letter that has been provided by the minister that this would pre-empt cabinet deliberations—that the documents relating to this order, the order that Senator Thorpe sought, would both disclose and pre-empt deliberations of cabinet. If those who make these claims would read <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span>, they would understand that this claim does not stack up, which is why we reject it. To claim loosely that cabinet documents are immune from production in the courts or at least orders by this place is not supported. Only documents which record or reveal the deliberations of cabinet are immune. The documents we're talking about here don't fit into that category. That's supported by case law, the case of the Commonwealth and the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union. The government hasn't got a leg to stand on here. They haven't done any work. It's an embarrassment. I applaud Senator Thorpe for moving this motion.</span>

                    <a href="263528" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator NAMPIJINPA PRICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:13</span>):  Twelve months ago, this government was advocating a voice to parliament for Indigenous Australians. Of course they talk a big talk in terms of their attempt, their suggestion, that they would act with transparency, accountability—all of these big words that they like to throw around, particularly when it comes to engaging with Indigenous Australians and planning for the betterment of the lives of Indigenous Australians. However, they have a terrible record. We know that this government was funding the EDO, which was found by the Federal Court to have been exploiting traditional owners. However, despite this, they continued to think that clearly this sort of conduct, this sort of behaviour, is perfectly acceptable and would continue to fund the EDO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Justice Charlesworth broadly criticised Dr O'Leary for having lied to the Tiwi Island witnesses, because he wanted his cultural-mapping exercise to be used in a way that would, of course, stop the pipeline. The problem with this Albanese government is that they are not actually interested in any level of transparency, accountability or consultation with Indigenous Australians on matters that relate to Indigenous Australians. We've heard all kinds of rhetoric around this. We have heard the Prime Minister himself say, in his passionate speech about the Indigenous Voice to Parliament, that once you start to listen to Indigenous Australians then that is when we will get the results that are needed. Well, they've clearly demonstrated that they're not actually interested or prepared to listen and properly consult or be accountable for lack of consultation with Indigenous Australians right across the issues that concern us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In their review of the EDO's conduct, this government didn't even know if traditional owners could make a submission to their review. It would be funny if it weren't so insulting and so ridiculous. They wax lyrical about their responsibilities, which, again, goes back to that issue of transparency. The reality that we know and that we've come to learn over and over again is that this simply is not true.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's time for the minister to show what responsibility looks like and what transparency looks like and to fess up about how serious they are about engaging Indigenous Australians. As the shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, I'm acutely aware of their lack of responsibility in this space from moment to moment, from the action on the ground in my own home community of Alice Springs, and aware of those that they failed to be honest with about conversations that they're having with regard to issues like the rollout of the $250 million that's supposedly to help in Central Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You've got a prime minister who flies in and flies out for photo opportunities in Indigenous communities such as the Binjari community to have the lovely backdrop of the community and of the housing to announce a new housing policy, while the Binjari Community Aboriginal Corporation stands there, waiting for their moment to have a conversation with the Prime Minister, who actually showed up in their community, only to be shoved to the side once the conference is done and dusted. Then, of course, the Prime Minister jumps in the car and runs away. Not good enough. More transparency is what needs to occur. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUGHES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  We all know that this Prime Minister is all hat and no cattle. That was on display at beef week just recently. We know he's all talk and no action. He's all promise with no follow-through. I just want to share with you some quotes that the now Prime Minister was wont to say, almost on repetition. 'Transparency is always a good idea,' he told ABC Drive. On <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunrise</span> in July 2022, he said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Well, what we need is transparency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And I want politics to be cleaned up. That's why my Government will establish an anti-corruption commission. And that's why we will have strict adherence to the code of conduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Code of conduct? I mean, we know that doesn't really apply, because when we last had estimates Minister Ayres was in so many breaches of it. It was so blatant, yet not even an eyebrow was raised by those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government is committed to integrity, honesty and accountability and Ministers in my Government (including Assistant Ministers) will observe standards of probity, governance and behaviour worthy of the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's part of the code of conduct. Behaviour worthy of the Australian people? I think today showed that, no, they're not—certainly not their backbench, when they call for genocide and the destruction of Israel. But there we are. Mr Albanese tweeted: 'We do need to restore faith in our political system. We need to make sure that there's transparency, accountability and integrity.' This is a government that is incapable of any of these things, and that's why we're here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To Senator Price's point, last year $456 million was spent on the Voice to Parliament—the Voice to Parliament that was going to be so important because we cared so much about Indigenous Australians. We were so wanting to make sure that Indigenous Australians had a direct voice into government, affecting decisions and having an impact on decisions that were going to have significance in their lives, yet here we are again. That was just part of an ideology. It was part of something Mr Albanese thought was a good idea. Again, once it failed, and spectacularly so—another great waste of money. To be fair, though, $456 million on the Voice now seems just like a little flurry, a bit of a flush, when you compare it to the billion dollars they're going to spend on the rebranding of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. These guys have just got absolutely no clue. Fiscal responsibility be damned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there is no accountability, no transparency and no honesty when it comes to the Australian people. Senator Thorpe has just made a request for some documents. She just wants to know what consultations happened, who's been spoken to and what the impacts are going to be, but we get arrogance and hubris from this government. We see it every Monday when we come back to parliament, on NDIS Monday, when we ask for documents that underpin the modelling of the NDIS and the assumptions that are made there. This is a program that's now going to cost more than Medicare, but these guys are unable to provide any modelling to show how they're going to dramatically impact the budget changes in that area, so why would they tell anyone what they're going to do around the national Indigenous heritage sites? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm in New South Wales, but I used to live in Perth, so I do pay a little bit of attention to what's happening over in WA and WA politics. They had an absolute disaster over in Western Australia because the state Labor government brought in legislation that meant that, in effect, if you wanted to trim the hydrangeas or dig a little hole to put a new tree in, you had to pay to get an Indigenous heritage assessment. It took away the limits of what you could do on your land. It was increasing costs and it was completely disastrous, and it had to be revoked.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">
                    </span>For some reason, the federal Labor government is determined to push on with these sorts of legislative programs. Because they're so arrogant, because they are so carried away by their own importance and significance, and their belief in their own belief, they're not even going to tell you about it before the next election. They assume they'll be re-elected and they can just do it without your imprimatur, without the Australian people knowing what they're even trying to push through. Shame on you all.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As all of us in this place know, Australians are getting totally dudded when it comes to the export of our gas. We're a gas powerhouse, exporting 75 per cent of the gas that we produce. In 2022 export revenue for LNG was close to $93 billion. That's more than double the federal government education budget for the same period. Yet not a single cent of petroleum resource rent tax was collected. Four major foreign gas producers—Exxon, Shell, INPEX and Chevron—have not paid a single cent of petroleum resource rent tax on the combined income of the nearly $300 billion that they've received from exporting our gas over the nine years to 2021-22.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of this failure in our tax system is huge. Every dollar of tax avoided by the gas industry is a dollar not available to fund our understaffed and underpaid frontline services. It's a dollar that we can't put into having more GPs for Australians to access through Medicare. It's a dollar that doesn't go to nurses and teachers. Every dollar of tax avoided is a dollar not available to invest in decarbonising the economy with the urgency that is required. Every dollar of tax avoided is a dollar not available to adapt our homes, our food systems and our ecosystems, in a budget that had nothing for nature—absolutely nothing for the places that Australians love and want to see protected. We're told that the budget is tight and that we can't afford to look after the environment, yet we're willing to let these multinationals export our gas for free. It makes no sense, and I think most Australians would ask: What are our politicians doing about it? How do they change this? And then they find out that we've got this petroleum resource rent tax bill before the Senate. They think, 'Maybe that could get us more tax, as we've seen other countries do.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Qatar exports about the same amount of gas as we do but collects 20 times more tax on gas than Australia. Norway has a taxation rate on gas of 78 per cent, nearly double the petroleum resource rent tax. The result is that they're now sitting on a sovereign wealth fund of $2.4 trillion. In 2023 the fund made a profit of $320 billion. We could be doing that for our resources; we could be getting a fair return for them. But we've got the major parties and now the Greens stitching up a deal to just move on with things: 'We don't care.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 90 per cent cap in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Accountability and Fairness) Bill does not even bring in additional revenue. It just brings forward payments that would have happened anyway. And it will bring forward only around $500 million a year. In 2022 that would have been around half a percent of the revenue earned on Australian gas. That seems really pitiful to me. That seems inadequate. I'm certainly hearing from the people I represent in the ACT that they want a better deal. We have huge challenges in front of us as a country, and this is revenue we could put to work to make Australians' lives better and set us up for the future. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">PRRT receipts since the policy was announced have been revised down by $500 million. So you basically wipe out these really weak changes that are being proposed by the government. We in this place should have a duty of care for young people and future generations. We should be making decisions that are good for young people and future generations. And this change to the petroleum resource rent tax bill is not that. It doesn't uphold that duty to ensure that we are benefiting young people from our resources and from the burning of gas that we know will saddle them with many challenges through their lifetime.</span>

I'm sorry to say, Senator, that you have been wildly misled and are misleading in your comments, because, in the 2022-23 year, $1.85 billion was paid in PRRT. That's with a 'b', not an 'm'—$1.85 billion. That's still at a time when that is a lot of money. That's from the PRRT around the country. That's because the PRRT, if you understand it, is a delayed depreciation mechanism. If you don't explain the full tax system, then you are potentially leaving Australians not fully informed, and that has got to be one of our singular roles in this place.</span>

What has happened is that Prime Minister Albanese has appointed Mr Bandt, from the other house, into the Labor cabinet as the resources minister. Just to clarify that again, Minister King is no longer the Labor Minister for Resources. It is Mr Adam Bandt, a member of the other place, the Greens political party leader, who is now the Labor cabinet Minister for Resources, it seems. This is terrible for the gas industry, it is terrible for energy policy and it is terrible for the cost of living for Australians, because what Labor are doing today, by the dirty deal they have done with the Greens political party, means they will be voting for higher taxes, for more red tape, for slower approvals and for gas shortfalls. </span>

Imagine the moment that we say to our close allies, 'Good news: we're going to turn your lights off because we can't keep ours on. Good news: those contracts that you were relying on are now not worth the paper they're written on.' Won't that be fantastic for our relationships in this geopolitical region that relies on Australia being a reliable source of gas, energy and minerals more broadly.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's just one more nail in the coffin for investor confidence in this country. Over the last two years we've seen interventions in the gas market, price caps, the introduction of unreliable renewables with no firming plans, additional green tape, cultural heritage expansion and the introduction of a new EPA. We're seeing further delays on the very things that will see Australians have lower electricity prices, more jobs in this country—to keep some manufacturing jobs. You know when Sorbent, when toilet paper manufacturers, leave Australia, as they have—they have moved to Indonesia—that it is a bad day for Australians. That is exactly what is happening right now, unless we wake up and take control of our resources and bring more gas to the market. </span>

The PRRT is what happens when Labor and Liberal governments over many decades allow fossil fuel corporations to write their own tax codes. That's what happens. They make out like bandits, and all the while they are cooking our planet, rendering this planet uninhabitable for human life and destroying the ecological systems that ultimately sustain all life on this planet, including human life. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear about what has happened. Santos, the big gas corporations, Labor and the Liberals wanted to collude to bypass First Nations voices and environmental protections so that they could fast-track more gas mines in the middle of a climate crisis and in the middle of ecological collapse. First Nations people, the environment movement and the climate movement, supported by the Greens in this place, fought back, and today we have had a great victory, because Labor's fast-tracked gas bill is now dead. It has been killed off by the Greens working together with so many Australians who do not support gas corporations having so much influence in this place and who do not support gas and other fossil fuel corporations—who are obscenely profiting while they are cooking the planet—being able to write their own laws in this parliament. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's fast-tracked gas laws were designed by the gas corporations for the gas corporations. They gave the resources minister the power to approve more gas mines with the flick of a pen—right in the middle of a climate crisis. Labor not only tried to deliver that; they tried to hide that provision in the middle of laws that are otherwise very beneficial to workers in fossil fuel corporations. </span>

Our message today to the big gas corporations is we see you, we know what you're up to and you are on notice. You might control the Labor and Liberal parties, but you do not control the Australian Greens, you do not control First Nations people in Australia and you do not control the millions of Australians who form part of the environment movement and the conservation movement and who want to see genuine and real action on climate change. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we have used our leverage, our power, in this parliament. This is what happens when you put the Greens in the balance of power. When you elect Greens MPs into the House of Representatives, into lower house seats, and when you elect Greens into the Senate, we will fight for you. We will fight for the environment, we will fight for climate action and we will fight the big corporations who are cooking the planet and rampantly profiteering and price gouging. We will fight for you by creating leverage, like we did by blocking Labor's PRRT legislation right up until today, and using the leverage to kill off Labor's fast-tracked gas bill. We make no apology for using our power in this place. We make no apology for using the leverage that the Australian people gave to us when they elected us into the Senate and the House of Representatives. We make no apology for using that leverage provided to us by the millions of Australians who voted Green to deliver outcomes like the one we have today, which has killed off Labor's fast-track gas bill.</span>

                  </a>  I thought you meant, 'Unfortunately, the minister has priority.' I certainly won't take up the Senate's time, so Senator Bragg can make his contribution. I did want to stand and briefly put the government's position, which is that we don't support the suspension of standing orders and don't support the motion as a whole, which is being moved by Senator David Pocock. The Senate has already determined its program for this afternoon, with a number of votes having been held. I would say to Senator Pocock that, if he wants to see money come to the budget sooner than it otherwise would have, he should support the sensible and modest changes to the PRRT that are being brought forward. I accept there's a difference in view about whether it's too much or not enough and whether the arrangements are right, but the passage of this bill is a better way of raising more revenue to come to the budget to assist with budget repair and all the priorities that Senator Pocock outlined.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="256063" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:41</span>):  I want to take the opportunity to speak to the bizarre situation we have, where this PRRT measure is bundled in with significant corporate governance reforms that have been flagged after the PwC scandal. This is a very consistent pattern. Minister Jones, who is notionally the minister for corporate governance in the government, seems to have some role in this particular bill. Often his bills, which are tax bills or bills on matters related to corporate governance, are introduced by Dr Leigh, though sometimes they are not. It is a bizarre way to treat a very serious reform package that I think everyone accepts is important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's been good work done on the PwC matter by Senators Pocock, O'Neill and Colbeck. To bundle it up with a PRRT measure seems very strange and is quite poor governance in and of itself. But the Labor government's commitment here to parliamentary scrutiny and governance of all these matters is strange. Either there is a deliberate judgement made in the executive to have a covering-up of information that should be publicly available, or there is a Treasury official drafting all the bills and the ministers are not paying any attention to detail. This is another of three or four attempts in the past few months in which corporate governance and financial services bills have had major deficiencies. We know this because of the detailed scrutiny that the Senate Standing Committees on Economics undertake, where the non-government senators work to look at the government's efforts on legislation. I have to say that it's been pretty ordinary. Only in the last few weeks the coalition and the Greens had to issue dissenting reports to tell the government its judgement to remove the parliamentary scrutiny in proposed changes to ASX ownership are to be rejected. That's because we believe that parliamentary oversight is a good thing. If there is to be a change in the ownership of something like the Australian Securities Exchange, then it should be subject to a disallowance. Similarly, the government is proposing to issue the Reserve Bank with enormous payments powers. I believe that, from a geopolitical and an economic perspective, payments policies will be very significant judgements in the coming years. The government's view is: 'We're not going to give any of these things to the parliament. This is all going to be outsourced and delegated to the central bank.' The central bank can effectively make laws without any parliamentary oversight or any capacity for the parliament to disallow an instrument.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All you have to do is read the <span style="font-style:italic;">Economist</span> from the last few weeks and you'll see there is a massive proliferation of payments systems around the globe. The Labor government's position is: 'That is not a matter for us. That is going to be a matter for the central bank.' It is the delegation of authority to agencies which is fundamentally undemocratic. That's why I want to put on the record the work that the coalition has done with the Greens, particularly Senator McKim, to highlight the government's commitment to covering up and neutering this parliament from having its proper role as a house of review.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ASX ownership, this bizarre meshing of issues in this bill and the payments policy matter are all instances of poor governance and either appalling drafting or a deliberate judgement made by the Treasury ministers. We imagine it's Minister Jones; we're not sure what he's doing. It is to be called out, and I appreciate the opportunity to put these remarks on the record.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Gallagher) to questions without notice asked by Senators Hume and Bragg today relating to the 2024-25 Budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know question time was some time ago. The main point I want to make in taking note of these answers is that the budget this week is a budget which has paid off the big unions and the major donors and favourite fellow travellers of the government. When I say that this is a government for vested interests, this is perhaps the best example of it. You see nothing for small business. You see efforts to reintroduce unionisation at universities, and, of course, you see the endless gravy train of more and more super for their best friends at the super funds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is part of a classic Labor approach to budget management. You've seen the essential desire of the government to increase taxation because spending is so high. While we see a surplus this year, we see deficits as far as the eye can see in the out years of the budget. So the government has made a conscious decision to spend up big over the course of these forward estimates. Of course, the people who will pay the bill are the people of Australia because the government has no money of its own. The only money the government has is the taxation it levies on its citizens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've already seen new taxes on superannuation and franking credits. We've also seen higher taxes in the personal income tax space. Who would have thought when we started this parliament almost two years ago that we would reinsert a tax bracket of 37c? We've gone back to the future. Who could have believed that? The reality is that the reinsertion of the 37c threshold means that bracket creep is back. Bracket creep is now a permanent feature of the Australian tax system. That is going to be one of the legacies of this bad government. We have gone back to the future, in a DeLorean perhaps, to a system where you have a 37c threshold and, if you do an extra shift or if you do a second job, you are on the hook for more tax. Bracket creep is back. That is going to be one of the shocking economic legacies of this government, which has unwound one of the very few reforms of the past few years. We are living in an era where governments have very low ambition. One of the only reforms to the tax system in recent years was the removal of that tax threshold, and now it is back. So you see more taxes to pay for the big spending. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You also see an obsession with these boondoggle schemes and funds: the National Reconstruction Fund, the Housing Australia Future Fund and now the made in Australia fund. All of these funds are chock full of union people—on their boards—so they can pay off, in financial terms, their favoured vested interests. It's a government for vested interests in terms of policy, and a government for vested interests in terms of the payment of taxpayer funds to special interests. That is the reality of this budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other big failure is housing. It's hugely disappointing. We see pages and pages in Budget Paper No. 1 on Labor's housing policy. What is the centrepiece of Labor's housing policy? The centrepiece is this hilarious commitment to 1.2 million new houses, a commitment which has been laughed at by the Premier of New South Wales, Chris Minns, who says that New South Wales will never meet its allocation of houses. Furthermore, Budget Paper No. 1 says clearly that the government will never meet the target of 1.2 million new houses. This is a huge fail on supply, and their only policy on the demand side is a policy called Help to Buy, a friendless scheme already run by the states and territories that no-one wants. The reason no-one wants it is that people don't want the government to own their house. No-one wants to co-own their house with the government. That is not the Australian way. That is not the Australian dream. The Labor Party is putting the Australian dream to death, as it governs for its special interests. It is a government for vested interests, which is killing the Australian dream. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="259819" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  Isn't it interesting when those opposite get the chance to talk about our budget, because we start to learn a little bit about what they have planned for Australians. Our budget, as you are aware, Madam Acting Deputy President Polley, and as many Australians are aware, was focused squarely on cost of living as a priority for the economic times but also on delivering an economy for the future. That's why we are delivering a tax cut for every Australian. We made sure that we were able to deliver a tax cut for every taxpayer out there. On top of the tax cuts that were already committed to, we made sure that there would be tax cuts for the lowest-paid workers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting when you hear those opposite talk about these tax cuts or about changes to the tax system that they're not quite able to say—they don't quite have the guts to—whether they would change these tax cuts if they were elected. They're not able to say that because we know that they will. We know that they want to rip those tax cuts away from low-paid workers, and they would if they had the chance. But our government is delivering those tax cuts on 1 July, and we're very excited to make sure that every taxpayer in regional Queensland, across Queensland, gets the tax cut that they deserve. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also making sure that we can deliver an economy for the future. That means delivering a future made in Australia—more manufacturing jobs all over Australia, particularly in our regions. When we talked about this commitment, when we talked about manufacturing, those opposite were very quick to say that they wouldn't be supporting a future made in Australia. Imagine saying you don't want to support more things being made here by Aussie workers! We know that this is an important policy for the future, and that's why we're delivering it. We know that it's important for manufacturing workers right now, but we also know that it's important for those manufacturing workers of the future that we are skilling up. Those opposite would tell those workers that they don't have a job here in Australia, that they would send their job overseas, because they don't support our plan to make more things here in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, you've heard those opposite talk about housing and our housing plan. What Senator Bragg did not mention in his criticisms of our plan is the $32 billion of investment that we are putting behind our commitment to build more homes in Australia. We are making sure that we're doing that in conjunction with the states. It is ludicrous to hear from those opposite any criticism of our plan to build housing when, after 10 years, they refused to hand over any money for social housing, any money for homelessness or any money to support the building of homes that are so drastically needed, particularly in regional areas. It's interesting: I want to know which parts of this housing plan those opposite oppose. Do they oppose the $1 billion that we are setting aside to build more homes for women and children fleeing domestic violence? Is that the bit that they would cut? Do they oppose programs like the regional first home buyers grant, a program that is rolling out homes in regional Queensland right now? Is that what they are against? Do they oppose us skilling up construction workers to make sure that we have people out there who are able to build homes right now and into the future? Are those the jobs that they would cut? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the most important issues facing Australians right now, we know that energy prices are putting pressure on households, so we are delivering relief through our energy relief package—$300 for every household. If you're in Queensland, we've managed to keep those assets in public hands, so you will get an even bigger package because the state government is delivering relief and the Australian government is too. When it comes to energy prices, we know that those opposite voted against our package the last time we put it through this place. We know that, given the chance, they'll probably vote against it again. We know that they've criticised it one day and flip-flopped and supported it the other. They want higher electricity prices. They literally voted in this chamber to have higher electricity prices—to make prices higher for people doing it tough. And they want less electricity in the market because they oppose renewable energy. On this side of the chamber, we're for more energy into the system and lower electricity prices. Those opposite are for higher energy prices and less electricity into the market. It is clear when they come in here and criticise our budget that they don't support us delivering a tax cut for every single Australian and energy bill relief for every single household. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  I withdraw. The speech that we just heard by Senator Green was riddled with a number of factual inaccuracies. The idea that Labor has kept assets in Queensland's hands is complete and utter rubbish. We saw under the Bligh-Beattie government the reckless sale of Queensland's infrastructure. The Port of Brisbane was sold for six times earnings and the forestry plantations were sold for five times earnings. The solar and wind farms back then were sold. We should never forget that it was the great Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen who built the coal-fired power stations that are the backbone of the eastern states' energy grid. Today we have the southern interconnector that basically sends energy down to the southern states and keeps the lights on in this country. In 1989, at the end of the Nationals government, we had the cheapest energy in the world.</span>

The best that this budget could come up with was a measly $300 to offset the thousands of dollars that energy prices have risen. It's a measly $6 a week. That is the best that Albanese could come up with. What a joke.</span>

                  </a>  All Prime Minister Albanese could come up with was a measly $6 a week to deal with the cost of living that has risen by tens of thousands of dollars during his term of government. And here they are claiming credit for the tax cuts. These tax cuts were initially introduced in our first week in parliament back in July 2019, and over the long term they're actually going to cost Australians more due to bracket creep. What the Labor government don't like to talk about is the fact that they're giving a little bit back now, but it's going to cost you more later. Mark my words: this side of the chamber will be going to the next election with more income tax cuts. I've been openly critical of the fact that we didn't cut income taxes enough in the nine years we were last in government. Something that I've advocated for in every backbench meeting that I go to is lower income taxes because it is the people in this country who get out of bed every day and put their noses to the grindstone who are going to drag us out of this inflation mess that we have got into.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Green's question about what we would like to cut is accusing the coalition of wanting to cut things. We do want to cut things. We want to cut immigration because that is completely unsustainable. The growth in immigration from 200,000 people to 500,000 people has been completely unmatched by the supply of new dwellings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing we'd like to cut and get rid of is the $23 billion subsidy to wealthy billionaires for green energy. The sad reality of it is that they're going to give the hardworking Australian family $6 a week and yet they are going to turn around and give wealthy billionaires like Andrew Forrest, and his green hydrogen fantasy, billions of dollars. That is a complete and utter joke. If Labor really wanted to lower energy prices in this country, they would get on and continue to build base-load power stations—especially coal, because that's readily accessible now—and they would also abolish the nuclear prohibition in this country. We need to be adopting nuclear power as soon as possible, because we have a vast abundance of resources in this country. Why on earth would you turn your back on homegrown resources, like uranium, coal and gas, only to turn around and subsidise billionaires to import foreign-made renewables? </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a bit rich for the Labor Party to claim that somehow the coalition doesn't want to bring back manufacturing. It was the Button plan of 1985 that sent manufacturing offshore. How could we ever forget that? If you want to bring manufacturing back onshore in this country, back our base-load energy supplies of coal, gas and uranium. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="257613" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GHOSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  I, too, rise to take note of answers to questions without notice. The coalition's history of financial irresponsibility is a nightmare from which this country is still struggling to awaken. When we came to government, inflation in this country was running at 6.1 per cent. In the 12 months to March 2024, it has reduced to 3.5 per cent—that is, nearly halved in the time we've been in government. One of the main challenges that the Albanese government has had to deal with is the inflationary hangover from the Morrison government—profligate spending, underinvestment in economic infrastructure and a complete neglect of systems of social support in this country. That's despite the fact that, across nine years, there was budget deficit after budget deficit, whereas what Labor has delivered now, for a second year running, is a budget surplus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following a budget surplus of $22.1 billion in 2022-23, the budget is forecasting a surplus of $9.3 billion in 2023-24. Though, once again grasping the nettle, the Treasurer does acknowledge that fiscal pressures intensify after that and that there will be future deficits. But progress has been made in strengthening the budget over that time. That is the serious effort of budget repair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since Prime Minister Albanese has taken government, we have identified $77.4 billion in savings. This budget identifies $27.9 billion in savings and reprioritisations. It limits real spending growth to an average of 1.4 per cent per year over the period since we came to government to 2027-28. That's less than half the average of the last 30 years and around a third of our predecessors. The budget improves the position by a forecast $214.7 billion over the six years to 2027-28, compared to at the time of the election, and it reduces debt as a share of the economy, with gross debt projected to peak at 35.2 per cent of GDP—almost 10 per cent lower than at the time of the election. So we've grasped the issue of inflation, we've grasped the issue of deficits and we've engaged in the hard work of budget repair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second wicked problem that we were left with, as reflected in the questions and answers at question time today, was a cost-of-living crisis. We address that at a number of different levels, including with a tax cut for all Australians, energy prices relief and, importantly—finally—real wages increase, after a long period of stagnation under the previous government. Annual real wages rose by 0.5 per cent in the year to the March quarter of 2024, and they're forecast to grow by 0.5 per cent for the next three years. Working Australians will have more money in their pockets as a result of higher real wages under an Albanese Labor government. When the coalition was in power, low wages growth was a deliberate design feature of the economic system that they sought to advance. It was an architecture that deliberately hurt working Australians. The coalition suppressed wages growth, adding to the current cost-of-living crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard a lot about housing today in the questions and answers given, but this is a government that's committed to improving housing supply in Australia and providing demand side assistance. There are a number of policies that my colleague Senator Green referred to. Perhaps the most relevant, in terms of our future planning opportunities, is that this government is supporting investments in infrastructure around housing. So there's a billion dollars in the budget that will help get homes built sooner, because it funds states and territories to build roads, sewers, and energy, water and community infrastructure that are essential not only to assist in building new houses but to make sure that those houses are in areas that are livable and that Australians can find a true home. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUGHES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  The Minister for Climate Change and Energy has done it again. He is sometimes the truthteller of the ALP. He has gone out and admitted that the $300 off everyone's electricity bill is the ALP's attempt to buy lower inflation. It is just an extraordinary lack of understanding of economics. When people have more money in their pocket and they go out and spend it, prices go up and inflation increases. Supply and demand equals price: that is the basics of economics. I wish Senator Scarr were here because he could pass around his book so that a few people could read it. It is extraordinary that this is what this government has managed to come up with: an attempt to buy inflation reduction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we know that that's not going to happen because the $300 is going to every household. We've got a place in Queensland and a place in Canberra that we own. I stay here, and we rent our house in Sydney, so I've got three power bills. That's three households. Am I getting a $900 reduction? We don't actually know because it's not very clear. No-one knows who is getting it. Everyone is talking about the millionaires and billionaires who are getting it who don't need it, but how many times are they getting it? It might not just be $300. We know that there are senators in this place with seven houses. Jim Chalmers, the Treasurer, has got two. Is he getting 600 bucks? I think some of the Greens have got four or five houses each. Is that 1,200 or 1,500 bucks coming their way? Who knows? Like everything with this Labor government, the devil is in the detail, which doesn't exist, and the transparency with which they share their plans with the Australian people is non-existent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Guillotine Thursday happened again today, as they buddy up with their mates to make sure that they can cover up all of their bad mistakes by not putting anything to the committee stage if they can help it, and ensuring that there is no oversight, no transparency and no integrity. There is just arrogance and hubris and a constant display of incompetence, with them needing to come back in and say: 'Oops, we made a mistake on that one. We'd better fix it up.' In the most recent case, the Attorney-General had to go and make some changes before the bill was even put to the House. But don't worry! We could have had a surplus of $10.3 billion if we weren't spending a billion dollars on the AAT rebrand. Never mind that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we do know about this budget is that it has gone down with every economist around the country like a lead balloon. Yesterday I heard the Minister for Finance say that, if you put 10 economists in a room, you'll come up with 10 different opinions, and I agree with that sentiment. It's usually the case. There's usually quite a big split among economist about what's going to happen and what they think the impacts will be going forward, but at the moment, for the first time I can recall, there seems to be universal damnation of this budget by every leading economist in this country. Not one has come out and said, 'This is a great budget.' They've said it's an election budget. They've said it's a budget that's going to lead to longer and more sticky inflation. They've said it's a budget that the Labor government thinks will be short-term gain but definitely long-term pain for the Australian taxpayer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is literally universal. I applaud the Minister for Finance and the Treasurer for their ability. It has never occurred before that every economist in the country thinks the budget is a stinker. And they are 100 per cent correct, because we have $315 billion worth of spending. This is a true Labor budget. It's another moment of truth-telling: tax and spend, tax and spend, tax and spend. Your income tax receipts are going through the roof. If you look through the budget estimates into the forwards, you are giving more and more of your money to this government. But going into the future, they are spending $4 more than that for every dollar. So they are contributing to this inflation. They are contributing to the issues the country is going to face long into the future due to the structural damage that they are continuing to do. The fact that they refer to their changes to the stage 3 tax cuts as cost-of-living relief shows their complete inability to understand that stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3—remember, there were other stages—were about tax reform. Those opposite don't understand what reform means. They don't understand economics. It's an absolute embarrassment and a shambles. The sooner we see the back of this government, the better. </span>

Labor's response is a managerial, business-as-usual budget that proposes to solve those great challenges by continuing the very actions that cause them or that allow them to happen. It's a turgid, bland, chaff-ridden budget. It's a betrayal of Australians who want action on climate change, action to protect nature and relief from the cost-of-living pressures that are smashing them. It's classic modern Labor: talk up an absolute storm on climate change and cost of living, then abjectly fail to take the strong and urgent action needed to respond to those challenges. It locks in worsening economic inequality and exacerbates the breakdown of the planet's climate and ecosystems. It's a budget for the wealthy, it's a budget for corporate interests and it's a budget for the donors that line the coffers of the Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are crying out for genuine government intervention to stop price gouging, to stop corporate profiteering and to have genuine, meaningful relief from cost-of-living pressures. Yet this budget does next to nothing to support those who really need our support. It has a pittance of rent relief for a handful of renters while containing tens of billions of dollars every year in subsidies for property investors who own multiple investment properties. There's lip service to renewables but over $50 billion worth of subsidies to encourage the burning of fossil fuels. There's handwringing about the pain people are feeling at the supermarket checkout but nothing to make price gouging illegal, nothing to break up the supermarket duopoly and no new money or measures to bring down food and grocery prices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's becoming harder and harder to tell the Labor and Liberal parties apart. At the last election people voted for change. They didn't vote for a Labor treasurer to bring down a Liberal budget. This budget reflects a party doing everything it can to cement the status quo that allows corporations and the wealthy to profit to the detriment of people and the planet. Where Labor is claiming to help people, it is providing the bare minimum of relief, and it's doing that because it's not really interested in solving problems; it's interested in trying to reduce the political pressure on it to solve problems, whether it's student debt, housing, rent caps or income support payments. Remember, Labor used to be a party of free education. It used to be a party of universal health care. It used to be a party of affordable housing. Now it is a party that bows to corporate vested interests, and nowhere is that more stark than in relation to coal and gas corporations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the very same day that scientists warned we are on the edge of a climate abyss, the Labor Party announced a plan to make Australia reliant on gas expansion well beyond 2050. This is an absolute capitulation to the coal and gas corporations—enforcing the burning of our planet, watching our coral reefs bleach and die, watching our ecosystems collapse, with thousands of species marching towards extinction. This is what state capture looks like. It is unconscionable and it is shameful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To renters struggling to afford rent hikes, to mortgage holders struggling to cope with record rate rises, to students skipping meals to keep a roof over their heads or dumpster diving to put food on the table, to everyone who can no longer afford to insure their own homes because vast parts of the country are becoming uninsurable because Labor continue to approve more coal and gas mines, know this one thing: Labor could have, in this budget, acted to help you. They simply chose not to.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="ING" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLAGHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Finance, Minister for Women, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Vice-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  I thank senators Birmingham and Waters for allowing me to be the minister that attends the Senate to give this explanation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On Tuesday the government tabled its guidance to departments on responses to estimates questions on notice without requiring any order of the Senate to do so. So it is bizarre that Senator Birmingham and Senator Waters rail against what they continue to erroneously describe as a secret document. They are more interested in conspiracy theories than facts. Senator Birmingham and Senator Waters decided to take the word of a media report rather than just asking the government for the document, which we were only too happy to provide. Then, having provided it, they still went ahead with the motion requiring Senator Wong's attendance today. This is despite there being ample opportunity to ask Senator Wong about it ad nauseam at estimates in just over a week's time. This a stunt worthy of student politics, not leaders of parties in the Senate, one allegedly a party of government. I can confirm that the Prime Minister did not see or review this document, but now anyone can read it because we've tabled it in the chamber and have put it on the public record.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet distributed this document to agencies to assist in the timely and efficient response to Senate estimates questions on notice. It was then shared with ministerial officers. Consistent with the Government Guidelines for Official Witnesses Before Parliamentary Committees and Related Matters, successive governments have seen departments consult with each other as part of the drafting process, including instances where similar questions are asked of all or multiple departments. Individual ministers, departments and agencies are ultimately responsible for the answers they provide. I can also confirm that there has been no subsequent advice or revisions in response to media reporting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These guidelines exist because we've seen an extraordinary surge in the number of questions on notice tabled in the Senate in the 47th Parliament. When those opposite were in government, the median average of questions they received each estimates round was roughly 3,800. In some rounds they received fewer than 1,000 questions. By comparison, the government is now receiving twice that number of questions—7,600—including more than 9,200 questions from February's session alone. Some of these questions then contain numerous subquestions, meaning that the true number is far beyond that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government wants the Public Service focused on working for all Australians. This includes answering questions that are genuinely in the public interest. But what we are too often seeing from the opposition are questions seemingly written to waste the resources of the Public Service. This is the grand irony of the feigned outrage from those opposite. Senator Birmingham wrote an op-ed overnight, bemoaning our efforts to rebuild the Public Service and complaining about perceived waste and inefficiencies. But Senator Birmingham himself tabled a question on notice that asked the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet what temperature their office thermostats were at. Yet he must stand in awe of the efforts of Senator Hume, who has asked nearly 13,000 questions since May 2022, including over 330 questions about the use of paper alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This newfound interest in accountability is particularly galling from the coalition, given that they boast a former prime minister who secretly appointed himself to five other ministries, including Senator Birmingham's areas; a current shadow attorney-general who refused to cooperate with an AFP investigation; and a leader of the nationals in the Senate who only gave evidence to an inquiry into sports rorts after the Senate forced her to do so. They also left more than 1,000 questions on notice unanswered when they left government, including some questions they refused to answer that dated back to October 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the board, our government is delivering a higher standard of integrity, transparency and accountability than those opposite ever did. We have lifted the country's ranking on Transparency International's annual Corruption Perception Index from 18 to 13, after a decade-long slide under the coalition. The National Anti-Corruption Commission has been established. We've strengthened the ministerial code of conduct, increased funding to the ANAO, restored transparency to AAT appointments, reinstated a standalone privacy and FOI commissioner and implemented the recommendations of the Bell inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is receiving far more questions than the previous government, and we're answering them at a higher rate than the previous government. We do so because we are committed to accountability and transparency, and the vexatious use of questions on notice by the Liberals and Nationals diminishes the capacity for us to respond in substance to legitimate questions asked by other parties and Independents. We believe that the Public Service, like this government, should spend its time working for Australian people and not auditing thermostats for Senator Birmingham's amusement.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a shameful and shameless attempt at systemic cover-up and obfuscation by the Albanese Labor government. The benignly named <span style="font-style:italic;">Approaches to </span><span style="font-style:italic;">SEQoNs</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> asked of all (or multiple) agencies</span> was provided by the government—let's be clear—only after journalists had found and published extracts of it and only after every single non-government senator had indicated their support for a motion requiring that it be tabled. The tabling of this document shows the systemic approach of the government to avoid answering questions. There is no defence to the blatant attempt to subvert legitimate processes of this Senate and no defence to the contempt shown by the government in this document. We've heard Senator Gallagher try to make a virtue out of tabling the document, yet the reality is that they were pushed and forced to table the document. And credit goes to the journalist at Capital Brief for uncovering it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The hypocrisy of the government in claiming time and again that a Labor government would herald a new era of transparency is on show. The minister often tells us how much words matter, and she's right—words do matter. They mattered when, in the lead-up to the election, the opposition promised Australians greater transparency, and when the Prime Minister said, pre election, that there would be a deeper respect for the Australian people and for the integrity of our democracy and real accountability. That's what he promised. After the election, he said that transparency is always a good idea. And he was still claiming that it was a good idea in January this year, just a few months ago, even as his office and/or his department were working on this manual—a manual of opaqueness and obfuscation. His own code of conduct promises integrity, honesty and accountability and that his ministers 'will observe standards of probity, governance and behaviour worthy of the Australia people'. Yet, remarkably, when this document has been exposed for what it is the government stands by it. How does this government act? It instructs department heads and departmental officials on how to avoid answering questions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we know what the Labor government means by 'transparency'. If a departmental secretary is asked how many meetings they've had with a minister: 'Don't answer the question; just say you've had lots of meetings with ministers.' If they're asked how much money is spent on retreats and external speakers: 'Don't actually detail that; just say it would be a diversion of resources to answer that.' If they're asked whether a department is spending taxpayer dollars on training or giving advice—even advice on how to answer questions at estimates—they should just say, 'We don't know, because it's not centrally recorded.' If they're asked for data or information that is routinely provided to senators through estimates, the Labor government's advice is to tell senators to just google it: 'Go and look it up elsewhere.' If they're asked detailed questions around estimates variations by government agencies and departments, the response is, 'Go and look in the parts of the budget paper that don't actually detail those estimates variations to the same extent.' This is apparently how the Albanese Labor government demonstrates integrity, honesty and accountability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Gallagher may say the Prime Minister had not seen this statement prior to its publication, but he certainly should have heard about it by now and he should not be standing by it. The Prime Minister should have torn this document up and instead said: 'Consistent with what I promised pre election, my instructions to ministers and departments are: do the best you can to answer the questions that are asked. Do it as directly, as straightforwardly, as you possibly can.' But that's not what we get. The Labor government is remarkably standing by this document, claiming it's because they're getting too many questions, and then having the gall to claim that they are answering more questions than had been answered before. Guess what? It's not answering the questions if you respond with the rubbish that's in this document. If your responses are what is written in this document, then you are avoiding answering the questions. If the government's responses are consistent with what's in this document, then it is a deliberate contempt and obfuscation of the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government can expect more questions to be asked of this document, about how it was developed and about what it means for the government's contempt of this chamber and how it can be held accountable in the future.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  Once again, we find ourselves in the uncomfortable and very rare position where all the non-government senators have agreed that the conduct of the government is deeply underwhelming. We saw a leaked version of this document, which is effectively a cheat sheet on how to not answer senators' questions in Senate estimates—a core part of our democracy—and, after pressure from this chamber, the government, five seconds before that, coughed up the full document and then wanted to leave it at that. They thought that was enough, that the document was tabled. The reason we are here today again is we need to know who wrote that document. We want to know how the Prime Minister ticked off on that document, and we want to know who had been sent a copy of that document.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm grateful the minister representing today has answered some of those questions. She said the Prime Minister hadn't seen it or reviewed it. We will be asking in estimates how that's possible—for a document emanating from the Prime Minister's Office to somehow not have come to the attention of the Prime Minister or have his imprimatur on it. That'll be a question for estimates. We now know it was distributed to agencies and through ministerial offices. We still don't know who authored it. I would like to understand the process of how a Prime Minister's Office document doesn't have the imprimatur of the Prime Minister; that doesn't make sense to me. Maybe I'm missing something; I've never been the Prime Minister before and I never will be, but I'd like to understand the level of involvement of the Prime Minister in this document.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be pursuing this in estimates. I thank the minister for the invitation to do so; we will certainly be doing that. This is a manual on how to not answer questions, and it's deeply disappointing because we were promised a more accountable and more transparent government. That's what people voted for, and that's why it's deeply shocking when a manual like this indicates that, in fact, that's not at all the approach that this administration is taking to important issues like transparency in Senate estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I called for multiple times yesterday in my contribution, the Prime Minister needs to retract this document. This is not an appropriate level of guidance. This is not what a government that wanted to be better on transparency and accountability should be telling their officers to do. The Prime Minister must retract this document and issue a fresh edict that says, 'Answer the question to the best of your ability in the most succinct and efficient way.' I don't understand where the chain of communication is failing here. The Prime Minister should have voluntarily done that already. Perhaps it will take further questioning in estimates and further consideration of this chamber for the Prime Minister to do that. It's deeply embarrassing yet again that it has to be this chamber that requires this government to conduct itself better. You should have coughed up this document in the first place. It shouldn't have taken a joint motion of all of the non-government senators to force you to disclose it. It shouldn't now be taking another move by all of the non-government senators to disclose who drafted it and where it was sent. We still don't know who actually drafted it. It shouldn't take the rest of us to call on the Prime Minister to make good on his promise to be more accountable and more transparent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister must retract this document. There are no two ways about it. The reason for that is that the author of this document could be in contempt of the Senate. Privileges resolution No. 6 is very clear about not interfering with the free exercise by the Senate or a committee of its authority. It's also very clear about an offence by a witness to not answer a relevant question or to give evidence that's false or misleading in any material particular or not substantially true in every material particular. We have those rules for a reason. It is deeply inappropriate for a document from the Prime Minister's office to essentially be instructing officials to ignore those rules and to do everything possible to avoid answering questions. That is not a government of accountability and transparency. You're not doing what you said on the tin. People didn't want to buy that tin, and they're not going to want to buy that tin next time if you don't fix this now. For the last time, we are urging the Prime Minister, through his representative in the chamber here today, to retract this document, have some ethics and stop showing contempt for the proper processes that you said you'd stand up for.</span>

They've been consistently disregarding the democratic principles not just of this chamber but indeed of the great privilege of holding government and the executive. This chamber exists to hold executive government to account. We are known worldwide for our estimates process that other parliaments wish they had. They wish they had a process as robust and genuine as the Australian Senate estimates process. But it is being absolutely trashed by Anthony Albanese, aided and abetted by senators in senior ministerial positions, who should know better. I know that Senator Wong and Senator Gallagher are two ministers in Albanese's government who respect the Senate, but they are being expected to mop up after Albo for this shocking document. This is a cheat sheet of how to evade scrutiny and genuine, legitimate questions not just from the crossbench but from the opposition, who have a right and entitlement to ask sensible and legitimate questions. This is a training manual for government departments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have made a big deal this week about expanding the APS, with 36,000 new Australian public servants coming to serve the Australian public. Yet they trash the professionalism of those very public servants by assuming that they don't know how to do their job—that they don't know how to fulfil the government's orders and also submit themselves to legitimate public scrutiny through the estimates process. This is essentially a document that gags the APS from doing their due diligence and duty as Australian public servants. It's one thing for the CPSU to clap for this government on the tens of thousands of new public servants; meanwhile the government is trying to silence them from doing their job, as other senators have made very clear—the whole chamber, bar the Labor Party, has done this. It seems that this is just business as usual for the Labor Party under Albo. It's BAU to be shutting down debate in the Australian House of Representatives on the biggest change to our transport industry since we got rid of the horse and cart. That happened this morning.</span>

They're guillotining today, not because it's the end of the year or the end of the financial year or because there's some technical reason we have to get legislation through this afternoon by close of business because otherwise the legislation will be moot—no, it's only for political reasons. It's so that the public doesn't know what's happening here, that a new tax is being implemented. It's that it doesn't need to know what this government is doing. The government is shrouding these public chambers and our public processes in secrecy. Mr Albanese swore that he'd operate a classic cabinet process, yet we've got ministers here refusing to answer questions and refusing to respond. It's a trashing of our very institutions, day in and day out. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Each time a minister comes in here and refuses to give an answer or refuses to table any information where documents are ordered to be produced, the Senate is diminished. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, it is! And you are diminishing this Senate daily and diminishing our democracy every time you use the guillotine for political purposes. This is not a student union where you just get to walk in with your constitution, do your numbers, wham, bam, we win, you don't and you're shouting us beers at the union pub. This is the Australian Senate. This is the Australian parliament.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We talked a lot about respect today. The President was talking about respect. Respect also means giving space for opposing voices to be heard. You will still win. Your legislation will still get passed, but you would have given the millions of people who don't agree with you an opportunity for their perspective to be put. I just think this is appalling and I have nothing more to say. </span>

What are we actually taking note of today? We are taking note of the pathetic explanation that was given by Minister Gallagher, on behalf of Minister Wong, in relation to why the Albanese government prepared a document that, as we know, has been provided to public servants and sets out for them (a) how not to answer questions in Senate estimates and (b), worse than that, gives them the actual suggested draft response.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In all my years in this place—and I'm going on 16 years in this place—I don't think I have ever seen a bigger flouting of democracy by a prime minister and a government. Can you honestly imagine if a coalition government had prepared such a document? This is not a rumour. This is not a suggestion. The document is right here. We have in the Senate a document provided by the Prime Minister's office for all of the Australian public to see. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Waters is right: if it's provided on behalf of the Prime Minister's office then quite frankly it's provided by the Prime Minister himself to the apolitical public service. I say 'apolitical' with tongue in cheek, because it's anything but when you've been provided a document by the Prime Minister of Australia's office that tells you how you should and should not answer questions in Senate estimates. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Albanese talked a big game on transparency prior to the last election. Mr Albanese actually said to the Australian people, in fact, that it was one of the reasons they should vote him in. He said to the Australian people that if they elected him and the Australian Labor Party to office he and his ministers would deliver transparency, integrity and accountability in every single thing they did. This is a government that in relation to so much of what it said prior to the election came falsely to power on the promise of a new era of transparency. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since that time, since that day in May 2022, it has done everything in its power to avoid scrutiny and transparency. But did anyone in this place ever think that Mr Albanese, his office and the Australian Labor Party would draft a document and provide it to agencies, who are there to provide frank and fearless advice and to answer questions put to them in Senate estimates in an honest and responsible way, a document that says to them, 'If you are asked this particular question, under the Albanese government we don't actually believe in transparency. We certainly do not believe in providing the opposition with answers to questions they are asking on behalf of the Australian taxpayer, and we want you to say this.' </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example: 'How many meetings has the secretary or agency head had with the ministers in their portfolio since whatever date?' You would have thought the secretary could flip through their diary and say, 'I have met with the minister once a week. I have met with the minister once a month.' Instead, this is what the Albanese government says its secretaries or departmental offices should say: 'The secretary regularly meets with portfolio ministers and, at times, ministers outside the portfolio.' </span>

Seriously? <span style="font-style:italic;">Yes Minister</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">Yes, Prime Minister</span> could not have scripted this, because it doesn't happen in countries like Australia. We are proud of our democracy. Mr Albanese, with a secret document, has done everything he can to undermine it. Shame on Mr Albanese. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:52</span>):  I note the minister's statement. I thank Minister Gallagher for her attendance and explanation, her explanation about Labor's destruction of democracy. The utter disrespect and contempt shown for this Senate and for the estimates process is beyond reproach. It's not just this instruction; it's the conduct of the bureaucrats that ministers allow. As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I remind all senators that our Senate is the house of review. It is constitutionally empowered to get what it asks for. The government seems to think it can decide what we can and can't see based on what is politically convenient to them. That is contempt. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You are frustrating the ability of the Senate and its committees to receive the information it has requested. At every single round of Senate estimates hearings hundreds of questions on notice are simply ignored. This information is available, but the minister has simply decided they won't hand it over. When officials do the right thing and give the information, as they are constitutionally required to, they are intimidated and berated. Immigration minister Clare O'Neil left immigration official Stephanie Foster in tears after she produced information to an estimates committee. This is evil, anti-democratic behaviour. Quite frankly, there's no reason a question on notice needs to go to a minister. The department should simply answer to the best of its ability without the censorship. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's culture of secrecy isn't limited to what we're talking about at estimates, though. We see orders for the production of documents ignored almost every single time, often with complicity from the Labor-Greens coalition, sometimes with teal Senator Pocock and sometimes from the Jacqui Lambie Network. I'll again flag to the Senate my proposal—I've introduced it many times—for a method to confidentially review a document subject to an order for the production of documents. We acknowledge that there may be arguments for not letting information be released to the public in a very narrow set of circumstances, but it's senators who should judge that; it should not be left to a minister's whim, a minister that wants to hide, to obfuscate. This estimates manual doesn't surprise me. Even if it didn't exist, my repeated experience is that there's a deeply embedded cultural problem in all government agencies to avoid answering questions to protect the minister, so-called, above them. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's more than one contempt of this parliament happening almost every sitting day. What we need to do as a Senate is punish that contempt, to stop it. That's the only way democracy is going to work in this chamber. This disrespect will continue because it has been allowed to continue. To the opposition I say: you're more than happy to roll into this chamber and gently slap Labor over the wrist with five-minute puff pieces and then walk out, all forgotten; yet you won't move a contempt motion on the dozens of examples that have already happened, as we have repeatedly suggested. That's what we need to do: move contempt motions. As a Senate we need to hold people who have breached Senate orders in contempt—hold breachers in contempt. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate has more powers than a royal commission. It has more powers than any upper house in the world except for the United States Senate. Sadly, the senators in here refuse to enforce those powers. It would only need to be done once or twice. Start taking real action against the contempt of this Senate or it will continue as it has and democracy will die. Senators, let's hold in contempt those who treat the people's Senate with contempt, to revitalise democracy, truth and accountability, and let's see less guillotining from the government as well. I know the Greens and some of the crossbench senators are regular supporters of guillotining, but guillotines don't allow the voice of the people to operate in this chamber. You're squashing democracy with guillotines, which we'll see in another couple of minutes. How many bills are going through? Is it about 18—16? I'm losing count now. </span>

Then we saw it go through with some significant amendments, with not one word on any of them. That's what the people of this country face. We need democracy. We need to revitalise democracy, truth and accountability. Let's hold breachers in contempt.</span>

When you sit in a court of law as a witness, you're asked to take an oath. That oath is that you swear that you're going to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I think those opposite have forgotten the middle phrase: the whole truth. That means you don't deflect, you don't divert, you don't intentionally withhold information from the Senate which you would be able to provide to the Senate. That's the mal-intent behind this manual which Senator Waters from my home state of Queensland touched upon. It's the mal-intent behind that manual, where you've got the information, you've got access to the information, you've had time to get the information, but you intentionally withhold that information and deflect.

You put them all in a terrible, terrible position. It really is shameful. It's made even more shameful by the pledges and promises before the election. Before the election, we were promised openness and a new era of transparency. After the election—exhibit A, your honour—this is the manual. 'How to avoid answering a question.' It's about how to obfuscate legitimate questions in the Senate and stop them being answered. 'Deflect, divert, and refuse to respond.' It's absolutely shameful. And then they're trying to deflect with this nonsense like, 'You've asked questions about X, Y or Z.' Sorry; that isn't the point. The point is the manual, which speaks for itself.

Today they were prepared to ride roughshod over our democratic institutions to deny debate, investigation or questions to ministers—legitimate questions that still need to be asked on behalf of the Australian people. Labor has refused to release the modelling that cost Australian taxpayers $750,000. What will the cost of this tax be for everyday Australians who can't afford an electric vehicle or where there isn't an electric vehicle in production that meets their needs on a continent like ours? It is a policy that will increase the cost to families of buying a new car in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis. What a way to finish budget week!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We support a policy that will result in families actually holding onto their existing vehicles for longer. That's actually what is going to happen because they won't be able to afford what's coming to them. Under Labor only one type of road user is exempt from contributing to the maintenance and safety of our roads, and they are those Australians who can afford to purchase an electric vehicle. They are not low-income earning Australians. They are not vulnerable families. They are not people in rural and communities. Everyone else—our tradies, apprentices, teachers, nurses and retail workers who are driving regular cars and can't afford electric vehicles—is actually going to be paying fuel excise to make sure our road maintenance is funded and to make sure our roads are safe. That includes truck drivers, bus drivers and families who drive ICE or hybrid engine cars. Let's not forget that this particular policy, which is going to be slammed through this chamber in the next few hours without debate, actually taxes hybrid vehicles.</span>

It includes biofuels, hydrogen vehicles and other technologies which could be commercialised over the next decade. We are seeking to amend this bill, and we wanted to have an inquiry to get well-rounded, well-thought-out amendments to make this a better bill. We are not against a transition to net zero by 2050, but you cannot hurt and harm low-income families and rural and regional families through the bill that's going to be slammed through.</span>

We want to delete the ratchet mechanism and make sure the minister is required to give consideration to price impact on Australians. We want to know what the emissions reductions will actually be because Australians are just going to keep these cars in the garage for longer because they won't be able to afford to transition in the timeframe and with the penalties that you're going to subject them to. We want to understand vehicle choice. We have one of the greatest ranges of choice in the world. You can buy cars here that you can't buy anywhere else, and it is because we need them to be different. We have vast differences.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ramming through bad legislation in this way cannot be justified, particularly the utterly inadequate changes to the petroleum resource rent tax. It's not surprising that the government doesn't want scrutiny of this legislation. Senator Gallagher called the amendment to the PRRT 'sensible and modest changes'. I would like to point out to the chamber and to Australians that the government were offered three options by Treasury, and they went with the weakest option: the one that doesn't increase it. It simply brings forward payments for our gas that's being exported. This is a weak change, and it deserves scrutiny from this chamber, despite Senator McKim's explanation that they have done a deal to basically keep our approvals process as is—an approvals process that has approved hundreds of fossil fuel projects, multiple awful offshore gas projects that we're not getting petroleum resource rent tax from. I'm still surprised the Greens have backed them into this. We could definitely put dental into Medicare if we raised the petroleum resource rent tax.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are some quotes from the Greens' dissenting report into this omnibus bill that bundles 'sensible changes' in light of the PwC scandal with the utterly inadequate changes to the petroleum resource rent tax:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed change to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT) … co-authored by the Government and the gas industry, is so bad that it will raise less revenue after these changes than has been raised in previous financial years.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet here we are with a guillotine that prevents us from actually digging into this and asking questions, as I, Senator Whish-Wilson and many other senators did with the sea dumping bill. You could argue that was also co-authored by the gas industry.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians deserve better than a parliament that's allowing multinationals to export our gas while we get so little in return. I was up in Darwin recently with Senate colleagues for the Middle Arm inquiry. We were out on Darwin Harbour, looking at INPEX's big export facility. They export billions and billions of dollars worth of LNG every year. We heard about the issues fishers on the harbour were facing—the decline in marine life—and I asked the NT government representative, 'What do you get for hosting this big export terminal in Darwin?' Their response was sheepish. They said: 'We get payroll tax. There are about 280 employees at INPEX, and the NT government gets payroll tax, but the federal government gets petroleum resource rent tax.' They were mistaken. We haven't had a cent from them yet—not a cent. Yet, here we are, throwing our communities under the bus.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former government used to talk about us having have lifters and leaners. Here are the leaners. Here are the ones who aren't contributing. They're taking our gas, shipping it overseas and not even paying us for it. Then, to add insult to injury, they are minimising their corporate tax bill. Those big exporters, who are not paying PRRT, a couple of years ago collectively paid less than one per cent corporate tax. Here we are: 'We'll just let them keep doing it. We'll just keep the approvals process as it is.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a press conference earlier with lower house independents. I have not seen them this fired up before. Someone who I think we all probably wish was our local MP, Dr Helen Haines, had this to say: 'We are here to represent the constituents that sent us here. Every member of parliament has a right to speak on a bill. This deal, and the stitch-up between the Greens and the government, to prevent an opportunity to improve a tax that the Greens themselves say is co-sponsored by the gas industry is a disgrace.' We can do better. There are models out there; we can do better.</span>

I'm informed by the Clerk that it's correct as you describe it: Senator McKenzie moved a contingency and spoke to it. The time then moved on and we were under the guillotine, so, under those provisions, Senator Pocock was able to move a contingency but shouldn't have spoken to it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Electricity bills haven't gone down by $275 as was pledged on 97 occasions—they've skyrocketed.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Under this Prime Minister, the great Australian dream of home ownership has turned into a nightmare.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Even finding somewhere to rent is near impossible. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has brought in an additional 923,000 migrants in just two years. </span>
