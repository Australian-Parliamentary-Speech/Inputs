                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Road Vehicle Standards Act 2018</span>, and its subordinate legislation, introduced improved and simplified regulatory arrangements for importing and providing road vehicles for the first time in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new arrangements deliver on the Australian Government's commitment to apply nationally consistent vehicle safety, environmental performance and security standards while also meeting consumer expectations that they may purchase a broad variety of road vehicles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Each week around 24,000 road vehicles are being entered on the Register of Approved Vehicles so that they can be provided to the Australian market under the new regulatory arrangements. Consumers can purchase nearly 400 unique makes of road vehicles under these arrangements, and their choices continue to grow as more manufacturers and importers are approved to provide their vehicles under the new legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill does not make material changes to the new legislative requirements for importing and providing road vehicles, which received bipartisan support in late 2018 and have already been adopted by large segments of industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Instead, this bill extends the transitional period for vehicle manufacturers and importers to fully conform to the new regulatory obligations from 12 to 24 months. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognised early that many businesses would require a transitional period during which they would provide road vehicles under certain provisions of the old legislation while aligning themselves to the new regulatory requirements. The Government provided a 12-month period for this purpose in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Road Vehicle Standards (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act 2018</span>. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This period commenced when the new legislation was fully implemented on 1 July 2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">During the transitional period to date, almost all road vehicle manufacturers and importers have had to manage the severe impacts of the COVID pandemic on road vehicle inventories and global supply chains. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has determined that a 12-month extension of the transitional period is necessary and sufficient to assist businesses that have not already transitioned to the new legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill does not exempt any road vehicle manufacturer or importer from the requirement to transition to the new legislation in order to continue providing road vehicles to Australian consumers. The bill preserves the Government's intent that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Road Vehicle Standards Act 2018</span> will provide the legislative basis for ensuring fair competition across Australia's automotive industry and consumer access to a variety of high quality and affordable road vehicles. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill maintains the provisions of the new legislation, and the vehicle type approval opt-in arrangements that ceased in late 2021 are not being re-opened. Road vehicle providers that have already transitioned to the new regulatory framework will be able to continue providing their vehicles using approvals granted to them under the new legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To sum up, the bill essentially provides additional time to transition to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Road Vehicle Standards Act 2018</span> to those businesses that need it without disrupting the commercial arrangements of road vehicle providers that have already transitioned to the new legislation. The bill delivers on the Government's objective to provide a fair, responsive and flexible legislative framework to support Australia's automobile industry for the benefit of industry participants and consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Clear guidance will be provided to industry and the general public to ensure awareness of the extended transitional period, and information will be made available to support businesses to transition to the new legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:35</span>):  Labor will support Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2021-2022 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2021-2022. They represent additional estimates for the 2021-22 financial year, with a total of $15.9 billion appropriated across the two bills—$11.9 billion in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and $4 billion in Appropriation Bill (No. 4). The financial impact of these bills was incorporated into the budget bottom line as at the 2021-22 MYEFO, which was delivered last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's appropriate that we debate these bills the day after the budget was delivered. What we saw last night was a fall in real wages, a trillion dollars in debt and the risk of a second wasted decade. Under the Morrison government, the cost of living is skyrocketing, real wages are going backwards and working families are falling further behind. Nothing in this budget makes up for a decade of attacks on wages, job security and Medicare. Its defining features are pay that won't keep up with prices and almost nothing to show for a trillion dollars in debt. It's a ploy for an election, not a plan for a better future. Australians need a pay rise, not a patch job that leaves them $25 a week worse off. An economy that works for everyone starts with a government that actually delivers what it announces, and we know that this one never does. It's a budget that includes $3 billion of secret cuts that the government has hidden—$3 billion of secret cuts that the government has hidden. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people will soon have a choice, and that choice is very clear: a Labor government led by Anthony Albanese will see budgets as an opportunity to plan for the future, not just plan for an election campaign; a leader who shows up, takes responsibility and wants to bring the country together versus a Prime Minister who can claim to do none of these things. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:38</span>):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2021-2022 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2021-2022. This government pretends that it can manage the economy, but all it really does is run up debt, keep wages down and waste money on rorts to keep itself in office. They have no macroreform or microreform agenda to deliver safe and secure jobs or to grow wages. Is there a single issue that faces our country that will be resolved by another three years of this lacklustre D-team government? They failed at disaster response, they failed at wage growth, they failed to address growing skills shortages and they failed to stand up to China. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's just failure after failure with this government. Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells let us in on why that is the case. It's the fraud at the head of a decaying government—Mr Morrison. The announcement of the Chinese base in the Solomon Islands shows the abject failure of the Pacific step-up and shows to all of us that this government's posturings as being tough on defence and strong on China are utterly failing to win the hearts and minds of our neighbours in the Pacific, and that failure matters. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The economic ineptitude of this government is complete and total. We've seen wages stagnate for nine years, we've seen key industries haemorrhage jobs or shut up entirely, like the car manufacturers, and we've seen the cost-of-living burden for ordinary Australians waking up every day continue to skyrocket. They're feeling more and more vulnerable, more and more insecure, not only in their own employment but in the sense of the future for them and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The economic model of this government—if I could be so generous as to call it that—is entirely shambolic. What happened to this government's supposed gas-fired recovery announced with great fanfare in 2020? The fact is, there are now 10 per cent fewer jobs in the industry, and two of Australia's oil refineries have closed during this term of government alone. Just think about the jobs, the jobs that are lost in that industry, despite the fanfare of the government's announcement. This is the government that positioned itself in public announcements as the saviour of the coalmining industry. But their track record tells a different story, and the truth simply does not align with the impressionistic painting of this government that it's there for you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake, last night we saw an urgent response to the cost of living because the government's only woken up to it in the last couple of weeks. For three terms they have allowed the conditions to exist that eroded safety and security for Australian families, increasing insecurity in work. They do not deserve another decade. They simply do not. As with all of the other budgets brought down by Josh Frydenberg, this one is about keeping his government in office by spending our taxpayer dollars like it's their Liberal Party money to buy seats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning I heard Mr Chalmers, the opposition Treasurer, describe the reality of what happened overnight as the equivalent of this government using your dollars and attaching it to their 'how to vote'. It's a vote buyer for a short-term hit; that's all it is. This morning Mr Josh Frydenberg was completely unable and totally unwilling to answer reasonable questions about the $3 billion of cuts that lie on the other side of the upcoming election. And you can bet your bottom dollar that it will be coming out of your pocket. It won't come out of the pocket of multinationals or huge businesses that aren't paying their fair share. It will be ordinary Australians, who've paid with wage stagnation, who will pay once again if we get this government back. This government does not deserve another term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rorts under this government have reached unprecedented levels, with hardly a budget going by that doesn't overrule departmental and other expert advice in favour of their political agenda. They're not using our money to benefit the nation—putting money where it's needed on merit—they're out there with their colour coded charts figuring out how they splash money where it's best for their election. That is not a plan for the country. That's a plan for the Liberal Party and the disgraced Mr Morrison, whose own team don't even support him and are willing to put on the record that he is a man who lacks character, a man who will lie to the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The infrastructure agenda for this country for the last four years has been dictated by that set of colour coded spreadsheets, by a list of marginal seats, and by the Treasurer's desire to save his own seat, to which he allocated a great amount of money for train station parking, commuter car parks which couldn't be delivered. In the end, he's had to pull the money. That's how chaotic the government's vote-buying exercises are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The $660 million commuter car park fund was a slush fund for Liberal marginal seat holders, so badly put together, so shambolic that, like the Treasurer's own seat, several had to be cancelled due to it being completely unfeasible. Two were to be built next to stations due to close. Others have been announced and cancelled, and now we're up to the reannouncement in time for the upcoming election campaign. My dad always used to say, 'Well, you can fool the people some of the time, but you can't fool them all the time.' Australians cannot and should not be fooled into another term, a fourth term, of this government in decay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that 77 per cent of those funds, your Australian taxpayer dollars, were funnelled by the coalition into its own seats—77 per cent—despite the fact that they only have a bare majority in the House of Representatives. It's hardly representative of need, other than the need for this government to buy its way back into office. They do not have a plan for the future of the average Australian. They're merely about planning for their own futures, because for those opposite, those in government, it's not about long-term infrastructure creation, it's not about long-term jobs and secure jobs and creating jobs; it's about keeping themselves in office. They don't care how much of your money they have to spend to do it, they will do it, even if it leads to gross mismanagement of our national economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every Australian knows about the sports rorts: Mr Morrison's sports rorts, the funnelling of hundreds of millions of dollars to Liberal and National held electorates in a desperate attempt to pork-barrel their seats. Although one minister fell on her sword, the money remained spent and Labor electorates missed out again. It's an economic campaign of punishment. The only savings this government seeks to find are in not spending any money in Labor seats they don't think they can win. If you live in a seat that they don't think they can win, they don't want to give you anything, even though it's your money. They are not investing wisely; they are not investing fairly. They are investing in themselves and in a small part of our country. That's because they have a miserly and small vision. It's time to be done with the Morrison government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's analysis in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> shows that just 15 per cent of projects that were announced under the government's multibillion-dollar infrastructure budget splurge have been endorsed by Infrastructure Australia, the very agency that is there to weigh up: where do we, as Australians, invest our money in our country to get the best value for our dollar? Only 15 per cent of the projects advanced by that body, Infrastructure Australia, were supported by the government. The rest of them they made up themselves for their own advantage. That is a failure of government. It's a sign of a rotten government that does not deserve another term. Imagine how much more debt they're going to plunge us into over another three desperate years of trying to keep office, if they get back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If all of that wasn't low enough, the government even rorted the disaster relief fund. In the middle of one of the worst floods ever to hit the Northern Rivers, the government denied funding to the local government areas in the federal electorate of Richmond, which is so ably represented by my colleague Justine Elliot. She has worked so hard for her constituency, alongside Janelle Saffin at state level, and they're fighting for a bit of a fair go. People there have everything they've ever owned floating down the street and mud running through their houses, and the country has to wait for Mr Morrison not to show up—sad enough, he had COVID and we can accept that—but he could have sent someone. He could have sent someone to stand up and say: 'I see your suffering. I understand the trauma of your community and I will support you in your hour of need.' But instead of doing the right thing, he failed to exercise a moral compass. He can pretend all he likes, but when Lismore was in flood and in need not only did he not show up but he didn't even bother to send somebody to represent him and do the job that we have a right to expect of our leaders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that, when the rain falls and the fires burn, disaster doesn't discriminate—whether you're a Labor voter or a Liberal voter or whether it's a Labor seat or a Liberal seat. Disasters up-end lives and they ruin dreams. People can be powerfully resourceful and can do a great job in their communities, and they will. Australians will rise to the challenge. But there are some things that are bigger than what just a handful of people can do. That is why we collectively elect a government. That is why we pay our taxes. It's so that the government can wisely invest our money to ensure we all benefit, we're all protected and we're all looked after—not in an arbitrary, selfish way that gives them a good grab for the TV or the radio but in a way that actually supports a community in need. Every single time in the last three years of Mr Morrison's shambolic and morally bankrupt government, he has failed that test. Given that, it's no wonder that he shut down entire streets. It's because he's too cowardly now to meet locals anywhere in the Northern Rivers of New South Wales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about debt. The clarion call from former Prime Minister Tony Abbott was that Australia had to live within its means, that we had to address an alleged debt and deficit disaster. But, right now, thanks to the rorts and the many wasted programs, the Liberals and their junior partners, the Nationals, have raised Australia's debt to nearly $1 trillion. That is five times the level of debt that Labor left when we left office. Mr Abbott called it a debt and deficit disaster. Look at what this Liberal government that pretends to be a great economic manager has done to our country. What do we have to show for it? I was in the seat of Parkes, talking to people in Dubbo, Wilcannia, Cobar, Broken Hill and out at the Menindee Lakes at Sunset Strip. How did they benefit from the regional infrastructure program that funded a swimming pool in North Sydney? Those opposite laugh when I point that out to them. They know that this government has completely walked away from telling the truth to Australians. It's so twisted, bitter and cynical in its representation of what they've done to this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been so many Liberal lies, just like the ones about there being no cuts to the ABC, no cuts to education and no cuts to health. Every Australian knows that this government is unfit to govern. It certainly has no economic credentials on which to stand other than its own fanfare of a mythology about the Liberals being good with money. Australians deserve better. They deserve value for money and they deserve integrity in government.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Supply Bill (No. 1) 2022-2023, together with the Supply Bill (No. 2) 2022-2023 and the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2022-2023, seek appropriations to facilitate the continuation of normal government business for the first five months of 2022-23. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Supply Bill (No. 1) 2022-2023 provides for just over $80 billion of appropriations for proposed expenditure on the ordinary annual services of the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The appropriations proposed in this Bill are generally based on five-twelfths of the estimated 2022-23 annual appropriations. The 2022-23 estimates are broadly the 2021-22 base, adjusted for economic and program specific parameters, and the effect of decisions announced as part of the 2021-22 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook or included in the 2021-22 Additional Estimates Appropriation Bills. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The five-twelfths allocations are adjusted where necessary for programs or entities that have uneven expenditure early in the financial year: for example, administered payments under programs that are made upfront in the financial year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also includes COVID-19 response measures that have been extended since the 2021-22 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook or the Additional Estimates' processes. This ensures that funding is available over winter and that essential support can continue to be provided early in the 2022-23 financial year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I wish to emphasise that this Bill seeks only to fund government expenditure on an interim basis until 2022-23 Budget Appropriation Bills have passed, therefore no new measures for the 2022-23 Budget are included in this Bill. This arrangement allows for an annual Appropriation Bill for the ordinary annual services of government to be passed by the next Parliament, in the usual way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also contains an Advance to the Finance Minister (AFM) provision of $2.4 billion to provide the Government with the capacity to allocate additional appropriations for urgent and unforeseen expenditure: $2 billion of the AFM provision is set aside for COVID-19-related expenditure and $400 million for other urgent and unforeseen expenditure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the COVID-19 AFM provision of a higher value accommodates the ongoing response to pressures emerging from the pandemic, the general AFM provision of a lower value marks a return to standard AFM arrangements. This completes the Government's commitment to return to pre-COVID-19 AFM settings when circumstances allow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The COVID-19 related AFM remains a temporary measure and will be ceased in a future year when it has been determined that COVID-19 risks have sufficiently moderated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In light of the size of the AFM, it is proposed to continue the strong accountability and transparency arrangements that have been in place from 2019-20 through to 2021-22, including a regular media release in weeks when AFMs are issued, which reports and reconciles the use of the AFM provision, and seeking the concurrence of the Opposition for any proposed AFM greater than $1 billion.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the Schedule to the Bill, the Explanatory Memorandum, and the Portfolio Budget Statements tabled in relation to the 2022-23 Budget Appropriation Bills.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill must be passed in this session to ensure funding is available for the first months of next financial year to all entities from 1 July 2022, thereby ensuring the continuity of program and service delivery.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:56</span>):  I rise to speak on Supply Bill (No. 1) 2022-2023 and Supply Bill (No. 2) 2022-2023, as well as Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2022-2023. These bills are required to ensure continuity of government for the 2022-23 financial year, and Labor supports these bills. In supporting these bills, I'd like to make a few short remarks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have been in power for almost a decade. That's nearly ten years that they've had to act on some of the pressures that are clearly here with us now. They take their lead from their Prime Minister. Apparently, you've got to wait for a problem to become a crisis before you can act and wait until wages haven't just flatlined but actually gone backwards, leaving the average worker hundreds of dollars worse off, before you can do anything about it. It's never meaningful action once a problem has become a crisis, is it? They don't have the vision to come up with a plan that will help Australians for the long term. It's all about political management with the Morrison government: short-term fixes and one-off payments to get through the media cycle, or, in this case, the next election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that is long on politics but short on plans, and this budget is just another example of that. What are they doing about the crisis that remains in aged care? They are saying, 'Oh, there's a one-off payment for staff, that's it,' and making no real commitment to implement the findings of the royal commission, including on minimum staffing levels. On wages they've come up short 52 of the 55 times they've presented wage forecasts, but they want us to believe that this time they really mean it—and, still, wages in this financial year go backwards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What they've handed down in this document is a bandaid, not a budget for the future. All the announcements in the world can't cover up the fact that, over the course of this term in office, they have tucked billions of dollars away in slush funds that they will rort all the way to the election, and there's no reason for us to believe that this budget is anything different. With nearly $1 trillion in debt and deficits for as far as the eye can see, the only thing that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have their eyes on is how they can hide billions in the budget to pork-barrel their way through the election and save their political lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Safer Communities Fund got a top-up last night. We know that this is one of the government's favourite funds to rort. Ninety-one per cent of round 3 funding went to the coalition's target seats. We wonder how much of that $50 million top-up is going to be distributed genuinely, or is it just going to happen in the same way that we saw 77 per cent of the Commuter Car Park Fund funnelled into coalition seats, the Building Better Regions Fund rorts and the sports rorts? There are so many examples of this government using the budget as the Liberal Party's own re-election fund. Is this really a budget for everyone, or is it a budget for those who live in the electorates where Mr Morrison wants to pick up votes? No wonder they have not funded the federal anticorruption commission Mr Morrison promised over 1,200 days ago. With these kinds of statistics, I'm not surprised they're worried about what it might find. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not to mention the colossal waste we've seen at the hands of this Prime Minister and his Treasurer. Over half a billion dollars has gone out the door to major consultancy companies in just the first eight months of this financial year alone. There was $20 billion in JobKeeper that went to companies whose revenue increased during COVID: that's $20 billion. Billions of dollars went on a second-rate NBN blow-out. Billions were spent on the submarine deal with the French before it was cancelled, and damages are still to come. There was $6 million on the COVIDSafe app, which didn't work. The list goes on and on. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most concerning things in this year's budget that there hasn't been much discussion on yet, though I expect there will be, is the $3 billion of hidden cuts forecast for after the election. What we see from the government—and it sums up their approach around political fixes versus governing for everybody—is that there's a big load of expenditure this side of the election and then secret cuts to services after the election. We don't know what they are. This morning, when asked, the Treasurer didn't know what they were either—or just wasn't telling us. That's $3 billion. Is it cuts to Medicare? Is it cuts to payments? Is it cuts to the Great Barrier Reef? Who knows? We have no idea where these cuts are going to be made. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we do know is that they come in after the election. That's what this Prime Minister's done. That's what this Treasurer has done in this budget. He's said: 'Here's a bandaid to get us through the next two months, three months, four months. We're going to give you this. But, when the election's over, if we are to win, this is what we're actually really about.' These secret cuts have to be called out and the government need to explain what they are. They cannot sneak their way through an election campaign when their own budget documents show $3 billion is going to be cut from spending programs after the election. We need to know the answer now. It's not good enough to hide it in the decisions taken but not yet announced column of the budget. We saw what they did with that last time, when they hid $16 billion there: 'Oh, yes, we've made all these decisions; we're just not going to tell you until it politically suits us.' This is exactly the same thing that's happening here: 'In decisions taken but not yet announced, in the years following the election, we are going to cut services; we're just not going to tell you what they are.' It could be Medicare. It could be aged care. It could be the NDIS. Who knows? The Treasurer knows. The Prime Minister knows. The cabinet know, presumably, because they signed off on the budget. Nobody's talking about it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With a few weeks to go before the election, we need to call this out and the government need to be upfront with what they have hidden in that part of the budget. We've cottoned on to it. Australians have cottoned on to it. They know they can't trust this government. They know that this government doesn't tell the truth. They know this Prime Minister doesn't tell the truth. They know it's all about marketing, quick fixes, never taking responsibility, never planning, never preparing and only managing a crisis in a media cycle. That's what this budget is: it's a political fix; it's not a plan for the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What Australians need is a plan for a better future, and that's what the Labor Party, under the leadership of Anthony Albanese, will offer and will campaign on and will deliver if we win government. And that's our plans to get wages moving, our plans on cheaper childcare, our plans on cheaper and cleaner energy and the jobs and economic opportunities that come with that, and our plans on free TAFE and skilling the nation after years of neglect that have left us in a situation where we have low unemployment and a massive skills mismatch across the country. That's because of the failure of this government to deal with the skills crisis in this country, which has led to the skills crisis through lack of planning. And most important for many Australians is how we deal with Medicare, how we guarantee Medicare, how we protect Medicare from this mob on the other side of the chamber. Strengthening Medicare and protecting Medicare is in Labor's DNA. We created it, we've protected it and we will continue to do so. We need to know whether the $3 billion in cuts that have been outlined in this budget, after the election, are about cutting peoples' access to Medicare. Until the government comes clean on that, that's what we will presume because they have got form on that. So I would challenge the government to come clean on what the $3 billion worth of cuts are.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  I must correct Senator Gallagher. Perhaps in the interests of brevity she forgot to mention the $3.5 billion of spending on utility helicopters, which has now been cancelled as well, and the Army Battle Management System, which has been withdrawn from service. Thank you very much, Senator Gallagher, for leaving that for me; that's good.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a huge problem in the defence space. Everything the Prime Minister is doing is targeting 2040—we're going to have a submarine in 2040, we're going to have submarine bases in 2040 and we're going to have an upsized ADF in 2040. Right now we have trouble in Ukraine. That's a spark that may let off the tinder box that is Taiwan and China. We have had Chinese warships travelling through the Arafura Sea lighting up P-80 aircraft with a laser, we've had regular deployments to watch Exercise Talisman Sabre and now we'll likely have a military base set up by China in the Solomons. Yet the government focuses on 2040. Can I remind the chamber and those listening that the only way a 2040 submarine delivered to the Royal Australian Navy will be able to properly help us in defence is if it's got a time machine to be able to come back to the present moment where we need to have good ADF capability. I was disappointed in the budget last night with some of the spending commitments envisaged for the Future Submarine, and I will come back to those.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about the fuel excise cut, and I note that I do have a second reading amendment in relation to this. On 22 February, I called on the government to reduce the fuel excise. I did that because, whilst it was prior to the Ukraine crisis, we could see the Russians mounting up at the border and it was almost inevitable that the Russians were going to cross into Ukraine. So I made a call for a cut in fuel excise. Then we saw a whole bunch of ministers responding to that call. On his show on 9 March, Ben Fordham asked Angus Taylor, 'Are you absolutely ruling out any change to the fuel excise between now and election day?' Angus Taylor replied, 'What I'm saying is that we have no plans to do that, Ben; we have no plans to do that.' Scott Morrison, at a presser on 15 March, said: 'You don't go and completely recalibrate your budget based on fluctuations in oil prices. They have gone up. They have gone down.' He was asked: 'Barnaby Joyce says changes to the fuel excise are off the table. Is he right?' The Prime Minister said: 'I haven't seen those comments'. Let's go to an interview on 17 March:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Asked whether cutting the tax would help in easing cost of living, the Deputy Prime Minister said: "No it won't".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                    </span>"But what it will do is it'll take money away that we spend on roads," …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's quite an irony. When the Treasurer gave a hint, over the weekend, that the fuel excise would be cut, at the same time he announced $18 billion in infrastructure programs, including roads. The Australian public have to make sure they understand this: fuel excise is not connected to road spending. Fuel excise, by law, must go into consolidated revenue, and it is politicians who decide how much is spent on roads. So there's a fallacy there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has been dragged, kicking and screaming, yesterday, to have a reduction in fuel excise, which is desperately needed by Australians who are suffering from increased rents and increased grocery prices. We've seen fuel prices go from $1.80 to $2.20 per litre, and that's crippling. You can't ease off on your fuel expenditure: you have to go to work; you have to take the kids to school; you do need to go to a doctor. Indeed, if you're in the country that situation is worse, because all of the distances are much greater. So it was obvious we needed some form of relief. But what did we see last night? We saw a halving of the fuel excise for six months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you: the reason fuel prices are high is that there has been an unlawful invasion of Ukraine by Russia. That's driven up the fuel prices because of sanctions. If you look at what's happening in Ukraine, the Russians are bogged down. They are not—thank goodness—going to annexe Ukraine. They might get part of it, and stop, and there will be some sort of negotiated settlement, no doubt. But before that there will be an insurgency, and these fuel prices are going to remain high until that insurgency concludes, because the sanctions are going to stay. There is no way that this is going to be over in six months—no way. And the government should know that. The government should be aware of the strategic circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why has it only given six months of relief? Because that's what it takes to get through the election. That's why we've got only six months of the cut in the fuel excise, because it's about buying votes. In fact, when I look at the budget as released last night, it is a budget to buy power, with a whole bunch of short-term sugar hits. Billions and billions of dollars are being spent to buy power. And that money will be a debt for our children and grandchildren. That's what's going on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I looked at the budget last night—and particularly as a South Australian—I was very disturbed. It is clear to me that Mr Morrison has delivered a budget that is a payback budget for South Australia. It's a payback budget because South Australian electors decided to elect Premier Malinauskas as our state leader. I am sure what's happened is that the government has gone through and struck out, deleted, all the bits about South Australia and said: 'Here's our punishment to you. Here's our payback to you.' If I look at the expenditure that's taking place, it delivers so little to South Australia. The portion of infrastructure spend for South Australia has gone from 22 per cent last year to only 16 per cent this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australia has also been left out of the government's regional transformational infrastructure program, which is basically $7.1 billion targeting the Northern Territory, northern and Central Queensland, the Pilbara and the Hunter. Let's make no mistake—and I've just glanced at a Greens amendment in relation to this—that is pork-barrelling. That is pork-barrelling to win an election. Now, I just want to make sure that the chamber is really clear on this: pork-barrelling is corruption. I'll say that again: pork-barrelling is corruption. It's taking taxpayers' money and directing it at projects that are intended to buy votes to allow people to stay in power. That is using taxpayers' money for personal benefit. We really have to think about change here. I'm sick and tired of us sitting here watching time go by and, just prior to an election, suddenly a whole bunch of announcements are made. They're made depending on a red or blue square in a spreadsheet. There are people who live in safe seats—and I'm talking about safe Liberal seats and safe Labor seats—who sit back and get nothing. Do you know what? There is likely to be a need for those people that is simply not being met because of political corruption. It's wrong. I had someone say to me yesterday on Sky: 'But that's how it has always been.' That might be the case, but it's wrong. We've got to change that. We've got to stand up and act with integrity. Let's start having projects planned out, going through a proper needs analysis, a proper check for value for money, making sure that we spend our money wisely in a coherent manner that seeks to grow the economic pie, to make the economic pie much tastier. None of this corruption, please! The Australian public are over it, including people who might be the beneficiary of some of this pork-barrelling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I foreshadow that I will, at an appropriate time, circulate an amendment to future appropriations bills related to that program to include South Australia. I would think that if Senator Lambie is listening she will do the same for Tasmania. And I would think that if Zali Steggall is listening she will do the same for people in her electorate. That would be harder for people in the Labor Party or the Liberal Party because they have to stick within party lines. But we Independents don't. I can assure you that that amendment will be circulated in due course.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look at the budget spending for South Australia. The North-South Corridor—that's all we ever seem to get in our budget spending. There's so much that we need in South Australia that is just not being addressed. I look at the Eyre Peninsula. We need a desal plant there. Just as Thomas Playford brought a pipeline from Morgan to Whyalla that totally transformed regional South Australia, we need to have proper water resources on the Eyre Peninsula. We need to have rail on the Eyre Peninsula. We need to have proper power capacity on the Eyre Peninsula. We need to have an extended runway at Coober Pedy. We need to fix up the road that leads to the ferry down at Kadina, in Wallaroo. We need all of those things. This is a punishment budget for South Australians voting for the Labor Party—make no mistake.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give a wake-up call to Rowan Ramsey. Liz Habermann may run in your electorate. You've got to get off your butt and stop just getting road funding, which is just a normal share. You stand up and wave a flag and say you've done a great thing for the Eyre Peninsula and for Grey. But you simply haven't—perfunctory at best. We saw what happened with Sam Telfer in Flinders, where Liz gave him a good shake-up. Good on her. She's taken a long-term safe Liberal seat and turned it into a marginal seat. That's going to be great for the people of Port Lincoln and Ceduna and all up the west coast of the Eyre Peninsula.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I looked at the shipbuilding plan. I looked at the graphic the government put in the budget around shipbuilding. For South Australia, for jobs, they included the Air Warfare Destroyer, the Hunter project and the Collins full-cycle docking work and life-of-type extension. But there is no graphic there that shows a future submarine—and that's because it's a decade away.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government keeps promising to South Australians projects like the Future Submarine project. We are obviously the most capable state for delivering something like that. But, in actual fact, there's really nothing in the budget in relation to that. We are not going to be building a submarine in South Australia for a decade, if ever, because the government's realised the mistake of the 2040 deadline. They are trying to roll it all the way back now. As they try to crunch that schedule, they are going to try to remove risks and they are going to point to South Australia and say: 'You know what? We are not going to do that there.' It will be just as we saw with Minister Reynolds making an announcement that they were going to build an HADR ship in Australia. Then, because of changing strategic circumstances, they have decided to buy that offshore. That's just the way this government has worked. Sadly, for South Australia, there's payback in this. People should remember when they go to the election that that's exactly what's happened. We have been ignored and punished because people chose to vote in Peter Malinauskas.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COX</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  We are in a climate crisis, and the government is pouring fuel on the fire. We need to ensure that this budget doesn't fund opening up the climate bomb in the Beetaloo. That is why we will be taking the unusual but not unprecedented move to seek to move an amendment to the Supply Bill (No. 1) 2022-2023 today. We are not seeking to block supply. We will not vote against the bill. This amendment will not affect the passage of the bill. What this amendment will do is not reduce the money being provided by the government, but it will prevent the government from spending our money turbocharging massive gas projects in the Northern Territory, from the Beetaloo to Middle Arm to Barossa, just as the climate crisis has started arriving—and the levee has been breached in Lismore. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are at a time in history when every moment matters and what we do matters. Unfortunately, we are running out of time. We must keep coal, oil and gas in the ground. But what we continue to see in this place is the government's infatuation with gas projects. This continues. It means approvals are being fast-tracked left, right and centre in this country without consent, without proper processes and approvals that truly assess the damage being caused to the environment and, again, without true free, prior and informed consent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I had the privilege of chairing the environment committee hearing on the Beetaloo. I heard from traditional owners, pastoralists and other people living in the Northern Territory about how they don't want fracking on their traditional lands, how they don't want this to affect the fragile and precious ecosystem in the Northern Territory. There's no doubt the drilling will have consequences on the flora, the fauna and also the cattle. This is what I heard from those farmers. It's further compounding the impact on endangered species and savanna ecosystems. Fracking will pose a serious risk to our precious groundwater. Groundwater is especially critical in the Northern Territory because it's 90 per cent of the water that is for human purposes, including drinking water, and it's drawn from the aquifers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But here we continue to ignore the independent review of fracking in the Northern Territory, the Pepper inquiry, the climate science that has noted the environmental, social and economic risks from fracking in the Territory. It's clear from the evidence that I heard that our legislative frameworks allow big corporations to get away with the destruction of country, and the regulatory policy framework that is still on the drawing board for the Northern Territory government means there are no checks and balances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These risks are unacceptable. Despite all this, despite the significant risk, despite the wishes of the people living in the Northern Territory, this government gives the green light in this budget to fast-track those approvals and continues the destruction of country that threatens the health, the wellbeing and the livelihoods of the people in the Northern Territory—granting public money to party donors for this climate-wrecking project that no-one wants and that is unethical, wasteful and a danger to our children's future.</span>

These supply bills seek authority from the parliament for the appropriation of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the first five months of the year 2022-23. The total of the appropriation sought through these three supply bills is just over $91 billion. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills must be passed in this session to ensure funding is available to all entities from 1 July 2022, thereby ensuring the continuity of program and service delivery in the early months of the next financial year. I also wish to emphasise that these bills only seek to appropriate money to fund government expenditure on an interim basis, until the annual appropriation bills have passed. Accordingly, no new measures for the 2022-23 budget are included in these bills. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to Senator Patrick's second reading amendment that calls for petrol indexation relief for 15 months, I would say this in response: we are cutting it to six months, consistent with what the budget and the Treasury have estimated for the duration of fuel price pressure. By the time we have got to the end of September this year, they're expecting the oil prices to have fallen. In New Zealand, by way of contrast, they have done it for the next three months—not six months as we have here. We think it will take longer than three months, and that's why we have kept it over the six-month period through when the fuel price increases are forecast, at this stage, to abate. Our excise cut halves the rate, which is currently 44c. This is broadly consistent with the reduction proposed by Senator Patrick, and for these reasons the government does not support the proposed amendment. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills that are before us include an additional $690.4 million to extend the COVID vaccination program until the end of 2022. While One Nation does not oppose the extending of the period that these vaccines are being offered, we oppose any attempt to mandate these vaccines and extend the use of these vaccines to infants and toddlers. We support freedom of choice and acceptance of a person's choice. We oppose totalitarianism and we oppose control over people. Last night, Health Minister Hunt did indeed reveal that planning is underway to extend COVID vaccines to children aged zero to four—babies and newborn infants to four-year-olds. The four-year-old has been described as the height of human civilisation  won't go into the reasons why, but it's quite clear. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the precious future of our species, of our nation. Clearly, this Morrison-Joyce government—and I hope the Liberals are listening—is intending on using the cover of the election to vaccinate infants and toddlers for a disease with a 100 per cent survival rate for a child that age. The injections are known to be killers, and now the Morrison-Joyce government wants to push it into babies. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to observe these bills allocate additional funding to extend the vaccine injury compensation scheme to cover the administering of COVID vaccines to infants and toddlers aged zero to four. Clearly, if we are to inject these poisons into the arms of our youngest then compensation should be on offer when the inevitable and needless injury and death result. Those injuries and those deaths will be at the hands of this parliament and everyone who votes for these provisions. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For two years now the Liberal Party and their sellout sidekicks, the Nationals, the Labor Party and the tail that wags the dog, the Greens, have been acting as a pharmaceutical company parliamentary lobby. Vote after vote has lined the pockets of foreign multinational pharmaceutical companies that are selling products on the basis of spurious provisional approvals of untested, or partially tested, experimental gene therapy treatments. The health minister, Greg Hunt, said, 'The world is engaged in the largest clinical vaccination trial,' yet what we've seen in this country is people forced, coerced and bullied into taking experimental gene therapy treatment or else losing their livelihoods, their ability to feed their children. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The notion of 'my body, my choice'—such a stalwart of the Greens party—has been trashed, and Greens voters have noticed. People now see the Greens are about globalist control, camouflaged behind a cloak of green. The Greens pretend to talk about standing up to corporates, but they are the patsies of the corporates. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyday Australians are quite rightly asking questions around vaccine harm, prompted by the sheer volume of Australians experiencing major vaccine side effects. I met a mother last week whose 23-year-old daughter died as a direct result of a vaccine—a COVID vaccine. I've heard of many others, and I commend Senator Rennick for his work on this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These side effects were obvious right from the start, if ATAGI had bothered to look—that's why we're here protecting, because they haven't bothered to look. We know that the highly limited testing of these COVID injections was compromised, corrupted and falsified. We know the TGA and ATAGI failed to obtain de-identified clinical patient data from the trials. Had they done so, they would have seen the trials indicated an unacceptable level of harm and loss of life. The Morrison-Joyce government made the wrong decision in approving these vaccines, and it knew, or should have known, at the time the wrong decision was made. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency has been intimidating and threatening medical practitioners in order to suppress the truth and maintain their loyal service to the pharmaceutical industry. I've been to meetings with doctors who can now see their industry has been trashed, their profession has been trashed. We don't go to see doctors now; we go to see ATAGI, we go to see TGA, we go to see AHPRA. The doctor-patient relationship has been trashed in this country—a 3,000-year-old tradition that started with the Greeks, trashed. We now consult with the regulators. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we can see doctors starting to stand up. We see the rates of miscarriage increasing 50 per cent in some instances, and 75 per cent is now the rate of miscarriage amongst people at fertility clinics—75 per cent of women miscarried. The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency has been intimidating and threatening medical practitioners in order to suppress the truth and maintain their loyal service to the pharmaceutical industry. Decisions around COVID vaccinations have been made by expert committees with unacceptable, massive, open conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry. University academics sitting on TGA expert panels are often funded by pharmaceutical companies. Career progression for academics depends on subservience to big pharma. The provisional approval process was conflicted to a criminal degree. A royal commission is needed to unroll the layers of disinformation, corruption and conflicted decision-making that have harmed so many Australians, in taking at least the 800 lives that we know of and the many, many more not reported because of the suppression of reporting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The register of childhood vaccinations was recently expanded to include flu shots. Is it the intention of this government, Minister, to include COVID shots in that register? In effect, this would make the COVID shots compulsory for children under the No Jab, No Play rules. We do not oppose vaccines; we insist on freedom of choice and acceptance of that choice. Could this government and this health department be so evil as to make COVID shots compulsory for children under the No Jab, No Play rules? Could they be so evil? Could they be so inhuman? I do not want to find out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I have moved One Nation's amendment on sheet 1589 to ensure that these funding bills do not allocate funds for the extension of COVID vaccines to children under the age of five—from birth to the age of four. The 47th Parliament, of course, will be free to make that decision. It's your decision. It's your conscience. I can only hope that the debate will honour the democratic process and that the right decision will be made, and humanity will be treated with respect and reverence, as humans should be, especially infants to four-year-olds—newborns to four-year-olds, the height of civilisation. I ask the Senate to support my amendment.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="39801" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  I am in continuation on this. Labor supports this bill and knows that something needs to be done to combat the rise in insurance premiums that North Queenslanders face due to the growing threat of natural disasters through that region. We have seen between 2007 and 2019 average home insurance premiums rise in real terms by 178 per cent in northern Australia, and combined house and contents rose by 122 per cent in northern Australia but decreased by three per cent in real terms in the rest of Australia. That gives you a real sense of the challenge facing those in North Queensland. The government tasked the ACCC with looking at what can be done, and the ACCC had an inquiry into insurance in northern Australia and recommended a number of measures to improve insurance affordability. However, it's important to note that they did argue against creating a reinsurance pool. The government has taken up none of those recommendations of the ACCC report and has instead gone ahead with the reinsurance pool. Many of those ACCC recommendations would have made a difference to insurance premiums over the course of this government. The LNP government have had nine long years to do something to reduce insurance premiums and yet they have acted only in the final days of parliament and days before an election is called. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After all this time we still can't get any details from the government about the supposed savings to average insurance holders. Australians know that they just can't trust this government's claims when it comes to this. The PM said first that it would save those people in North Queensland 10 per cent on their premiums. Now you have Minister Sukkar saying people will save 46 per cent for home and contents insurance and 58 per cent for strata insurance. Although the government have been using the language that those savings would apply to people with the most acute cost pressures, they still won't detail or define how many people would fit in this category, so we have no idea how many people they're claiming would benefit from these savings. We had the Prime Minister saying first that it would be 10 per cent and we have Minister Sukkar now saying something different, and they won't actually release any modelling or detail to give proof to their claims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have been very secretive about the modelling that underpins these apparent savings claims. Despite the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into this legislation, the government continues to claim public interest immunity. The government's refusal to release this critical information has made it extremely difficult for the insurance companies to assess these claims and model the impacts on their customers in North Queensland. We heard this in the Senate economics committee inquiry into this bill. A number of witnesses raised concerns about the lack of transparency on this modelling. The RACQ submitted to the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To date, RACQ cannot assess the impact the pool will have on our member's home insurance premiums, primarily because we have not received proposed pricing rates or associated modelling from the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During hearings, representatives of the RACQ confirmed that they still hadn't heard anything regarding the modelling and said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the reality is that we cannot determine the savings at this point in time until we see more information and that includes the price from the ARPC. We need to understand what the pool is going to cover. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, the Northern Australian Insurance Lobby said it would like to see the modelling, as it was uncertain who would actually see the savings. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We would love to see the modelling and how that will impact policyholders, because it says 'up to 46 per cent'. Are 90 per cent of people going to get a five per cent saving and only 10 per cent get the 46 per cent saving? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sure Insurance, which has a lot of coverage in North Queensland, were concerned that these changes could result in their policyholders actually receiving an increase in insurance premiums. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The prospect of some policy holders being potentially handed a non-negotiable price rise because of the pool's introduction is clearly not acceptable for Sure's customers, and may potentially be viewed as a failure of government policy in its stated public commitment to insurance affordability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a business grown in North Queensland, providing affordable insurance to those people, saying that they are nervous that this could actually lead to an increase in premiums for their customers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you can see, it's not only Labor that has been calling for transparency on the modelling; it is the companies that are providing insurance to North Queenslanders, which makes it more outrageous that, while North Queenslanders are paying record prices for insurance, this government claims it is not in the public interest to release this information. How can North Queenslanders trust this government, which still hasn't acted on the findings of the ACCC report and, having has spent nine long years in power, has done nothing to ease the cost of living and is now trying to pass reinsurance legislation in the last moments of parliament and yet won't release the critical modelling underpinning this legislation?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the economics committee Labor raised concerns about the claims period. Currently the legislation has a 48-hour claims period following the downgrade of a cyclone by the Bureau of Meteorology. Many groups are saying that this is completely inadequate. These calls are represented in the report. They were made by groups like the RACQ, the Insurance Council of Australia, the National Insurance Brokers Association, the Northern Territory Chamber of Commerce, the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, the Council of Small Business Australia and the North Queensland Regional Organisation of Councils. So a wide array of organisations are concerned about the limiting nature of this legislation for insurance claims as well. This is best evidenced by the North Queensland Regional Organisation of Councils, which stated in its submission to the committee that, in its opinion, 'a claim period of 48 hours is inadequately short'. It went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, the Herbert River and the Burdekin River catchments cover 132,330 km², or about 7.6% of Queensland. In catchments this size, it takes several days for the full effect of cyclone related floods to be felt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It would be unfair for communities affected by TC-related floods to miss out on the benefits of this legislation, simply because they live in a large catchment where flood waters take more than 48 hours to reach them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For North Queensland, a 48-hour claim caveat is inadequate and needs to be extended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has called on the government to spend more on mitigation as well. Labor is committed to spending $200 million a year on disaster prevention and mitigation. The Morrison government set up a $4 billion emergency response fund. It's now got $4.7 billion in it and has accrued $750 million in interest while the government has not spent a cent on mitigation projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've seen firsthand how crucial these mitigation projects are. In April last year I travelled to Roma with Labor's shadow assistant minister for financial services, Matt Thistlethwaite, and we met with Mayor Tyson Golder, who showed us the benefits the flood levee has brought to Roma and how it has led to reductions in insurance premiums for those in town. The levee was a great example of how governments can deliver important infrastructure projects that prevent flood damage to houses and businesses and lead to ongoing savings in insurance premiums. These are the kinds of projects we need to see the government invest in to protect businesses and households and also help reduce the cost of insurance premiums in North Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, as we've seen with the reinsurance pool and the issue of the ongoing exorbitant costs of insurance in North Queensland, this is a government that has had nine years to act. It finally try to act now before parliament finishes and days from an election being called, but you can still have little confidence that this is going to lead to a reduction in insurance premiums for those people in North Queensland who need it the most.</span>

Sometimes you might have just forgotten to fill out the form, but many times it's because people hit a point where they simply cannot afford to do it anymore. They weigh up the risk and the reward. Household insurance can now cost $2,000 in a non-high-risk environment. What happens when you get to the point—as has happened in northern Queensland, and I see Senator Malarndirri McCarthy here from the Northern Territory, as well as Senator Watt. They know all too well that there has been a 300 or 400 per cent increase in insurance in the north of this country? I'm delighted to see people back in the building and here in the gallery, because you know what I'm talking about.</span>

                    </a>  I recognise the mayor of Alice Springs here; it's great that you've joined us in the Senate. I bet that you and your council and your state government know about this issue. This government knew about this issue. It's known about this issue for three terms, for nearly 10 years, and, in just a matter of weeks, they're going to line up, and they're looking for us to re-elect them to have another crack.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we are at the very last day that the Senate is sitting. So urgent is this need, which has been known to the government for a decade, that they finally get the car into gear and bring a piece of legislation in here. It's beautifully titled because, with a government that's all about marketing, the title matters. Forget about the substance; it's the con job from the top—from Mr Morrison, whose character was revealed in this chamber last night by Senator Fierravanti-Wells. She knows him. The longer that guy hangs around, the more Australians are learning about him. The ultimate con artist. The ultimate marketeer. He's not a man for leadership and not a man of integrity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what he has called it: Treasury Laws Amendment—well, it has got to come from the Treasury department—(Cyclone and Flood Damage Reinsurance Pool) Bill. Doesn't that sound good to people who can't afford their insurance? They think: 'Oh great! The government are going to come and rescue us. Because I can't afford $2,000, $4,000 $6,000 or $8,000—because I can't afford from $2,000 to $8,000 to insure my house—the government are charging in, albeit belatedly, on their white horse at the last minute and they're going to make it possible for me to insure my house.'</span>

                    </a>  They've missed the battle—absolutely. They've missed the battle for sure. But do you know what else? They're riding in on a horse that's a pretence. When you start look at the fine print in this piece of legislation, about who might be eligible to get some bit of assistance with their insurance, you see it shrink and shrink and shrink. That's the problem.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Watt made a fantastic contribution yesterday. I also acknowledge Senator Chisholm. They fight here every day for the people of Queensland. They talked about the market failure. They talked about outsourcing of government responsibility, to make policyholders pay and pay for what has been emerging in the last several years as a failed market. I believe it was Senator Watt who drew my attention to the fact that this legislation indicates that people with the most acute cost pressures might just might get something. If you're one of those lucky few who are subject to what needs to be classified as cyclone damage—not flood damage; that's not included, although that's part of what will be implied by the marketing man who is no leader—you might get something. If you're one of those few lucky ones, at the very, very best you might get 46 per cent. That's the line that goes out from the government and that's what we hear here day in, day out: the con job. 'What's the biggest way we can gild this lily and pretend we're actually caring for the people of Australia?' It's all announcement and no delivery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They're bringing this bill in at this point in time and, as little as it is and as little as it does, Labor will support it because people need something. They absolutely, desperately need something, and, if this is the best that this government can do, we're not going to stop the people of northern Australia getting the relief that they can get—that small bit. But we've got no confidence in what the government have told us. We know that, despite the press release and the numbers that they put out, the fine print reveals a different story. In fact, the claims that they make and the numbers they put out are really just pulled out of the air. They can't produce the modelling. Remember when you were at school and the kids who were fantastic at maths went on to be actuaries? They do their job for the country. They tell the truth. They write the numbers. They do the sums and they figure out what it's going to cost. That's modelling. The government claim they have it. They also claim that it's not in the public interest for you to know what's in that modelling. It's breathtaking. It's the art of a conman and trickster. That's what happens when you have a man who's leading the country by PowerPoint and marketing plan, without an ethical bone in his body and with no moral compass, integrity or ability to tell the truth to the people of Australia. The people it's going to hurt are the people who will be sold this false promise by this government—people in the north.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I tell you who else is struggling today: those people in Lismore. We all know that the Prime Minister doesn't hold a hose when the fires are burning. I will acknowledge that the Prime Minister had COVID in the time that Lismore was suffering worst in recent weeks, so we'll give him a leave pass for that. But surely he could have sent someone from the government. He has a Treasurer. He has a whole raft of ministers who could have done the job of going to Lismore, seeing what was really going on and giving people hope, heart, comfort, resources and a plan. They talk a big game for business, but they fail to deliver.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It took Mr Morrison nine days. People's houses were awash, with mud-stained walls. Three thousand houses, I believe, were declared unfit for habitation, in a community where rents are going through the roof and the market is already very small. The need was desperate on every single level. Instead of sending somebody, Mr Morrison hung on and then hung on a bit more until nine days later, when he could show up and do a photo-op. What did he actually deliver? He shut a few roads so that he wouldn't have to meet the community. He's a Prime Minister who is running from responsibility, and he should run fast and hard because he's incapable of leading us in the way that we deserve. He's incapable of leading for people who are profoundly vulnerable right now in Lismore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a contrast. We have amazing people at state level in the Labor Party. I've been waiting for the Prime Minister to come out with some sort of plan that would be digestible for the people of Lismore, to give them hope and to actually provide money, resources and targeted, planned support for businesses. Businesses in regional communities are the heart of the community—no businesses, no jobs. Labor understands that. You need great jobs that pay and businesses that are successful. All that can work together in an ecosystem when it's properly supported by a government that doesn't waste and rort money and buy seats for itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Mr Minns, the Leader of the Opposition, went up to Lismore, he had a flood response plan. We haven't heard that from the government of Australia, with all its resources. It's practical in nature, because all the weasel words, all the magic words, all the marketing words and all the pretence of the Prime Minister cannot actually meet the reality of ordinary Australians. They needed a plan, and this is what a plan might sound like. Mr Minns said: 'What do families and businesses need? They need the waiving of local and state government fees and charges for those impacted by the flood.' Mr Morrison says: 'Oh, it's not my responsibility. We're talking about local and state costs.' But where's his conversation with the state to say, 'I know that you're going to have a big financial burden there, so how can the government of Australia help you?' That hasn't happened. Mr Minns said, 'Waive or defer payroll tax for small businesses in flood affected areas'. I'm pretty sure, having grown up in a family business and continuing to have a business with my husband, that, if I were in Lismore and I were inundated, that would be good news to hear. What can Mr Morrison do about it? Hands off. Do nothing. Pretend.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps somewhere down the track, if he's elected again, at five minutes to midnight we will get another bill like the one that we're debating today: wholly inadequate, full of contradiction and unable to be verified because of a failure to release modelling. If we're lucky, that's what we might get from Mr Morrison and his climate deniers. That's where we are, Australia: at the tail end of a decade of denial of climate realities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can only pretend for so long before the game's up. Well, the game's up, the time's up and Mr Morrison's time is absolutely certainly up. It's time to elect a decent government that will stand for all Australians—a government that, when you are in need, you can count on to deliver the basic things you need to get back on your feet and have a little bit of hope. We are capable of doing that as a nation, but not with this party in government and not with the soulless, heartless, valueless Mr Morrison in charge.</span>

The climate has changed. These floods that we have experienced and witnessed—and that, sadly, many have lost their homes and their livelihoods as a result of—have been fuelled by the climate crisis.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I take the opportunity today to contribute to this debate because something extraordinary happened in this place yesterday: the Environment and Communications References Committee was forced to make an interim report about the conduct of a US company. This was part of the inquiry into the Beetaloo basin. This US company, Tamboran, has just in the last month received $7.5 million in public money from the Morrison government. This company—which has a wholly owned subsidiary, Sweetpea Petroleum, registered to a notorious tax secrecy jurisdiction in Delaware—is now involved in getting public money from the Morrison government to frack in the Beetaloo basin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the Senate inquiry into the Beetaloo drilling program, the committee wrote to this company on three occasions, inviting them to appear and to answer questions in light of receiving this public money. With the first two requests, the company replied, saying they did not want to appear. The last request invited them to reconsider, and there was a delay in the response, but they again refused and made the claim:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be very clear about this. A Senate inquiry asked a company that is in receipt of public money to appear before us at a hearing to answer questions, and this company says it doesn't have to come.

                    </a>  The conclusion, at the end of this debate on this bill—a bill that is spending public money and asking for public money to be spent on cleaning up in response to the climate crisis—is that here we have a company that refuses to comply with a summons. Let me be very clear here: this is a bad precedent for any company, for any process, for this Senate to not take seriously. I would appreciate it if the Senate were actually to give proper time to debate and discuss this matter, because it is about the powers of this place. So I will conclude my speech here, but let me say—it's a message to the government and to the opposition—please, give us some time this afternoon to make sure we can discuss this properly. Otherwise, the powers of the Senate are useless.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUME</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Superannuation, Financial Services and the Digital Economy and Minister for Women's Economic Security</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  Firstly, I would like to thank those senators who have contributed to this debate. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Cyclone and Flood Damage Reinsurance Pool) Bill 2022 will establish a reinsurance pool for cyclones and related flood damage. The pool is backed by a $10 billion annually reinstated Commonwealth guarantee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Access to affordable insurance is vital to the economic prosperity and resilience of Australians who live and work in northern Australia. This bill will deliver on the government's commitment to maximising northern Australia's potential and to ensuring that Australians in cyclone prone areas have access to affordable insurance. The bill will improve the accessibility and affordability of insurance for households and small businesses with cyclone and related flood damage risk by reducing the cost of reinsurance. This is estimated to reduce premiums by $2.9 billion and cover more than 800,000 household, strata and small business property insurance policies in northern Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The pool is also expected to increase competition by encouraging greater insurance participation, greater insurer participation in cyclone prone areas and support higher levels of insurance coverage for property owners. The savings generated by the pool will be targeted at policy holders with medium to high exposure to ensure that northern Australians facing the largest insurance affordability pressures receive the greatest benefits from the pool.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following a direction from the government, the Australian Competition and Consumer Competition, the ACCC, has begun work to monitor and collect data to ensure that savings are passed on to policy holders and that the reinsurance pool is delivering on its intended outcomes. In addition, the Treasury will undertake a 12-month review of the pool.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to thank the Senate Economics Legislation Committee for their consideration of the bill and for their recommendation that the bill be passed. I commend this bill to the Senate. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments have been circulated. I want to make it very clear that it would be more equitable for more Australians to get the benefit of cheaper insurance through a government not-for-profit reinsurance scheme, which is what these amendments propose. If passed, these amendments also mean it would be less administratively burdensome, because the amended bill wouldn't require insurers to distinguish between the risk of non-cyclone-related floods and the risk of cyclone related floods, and it wouldn't require them to seek private market insurance for non-cyclone-related floods. In other words, all reinsurance for all flood damage would be covered under this scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So these amendments expand the scope of the scheme, they make it more equitable and they mean that more Australians would benefit through lower insurance premiums, which are only going keep climbing, because of the climate emergency that we are living in—the breakdown of our planet's climate—which is being turbocharged by this government. Not least of the ways in which they have turbocharged the climate emergency is in the budget they released last night, which contains about $10 billion per year to encourage the accelerated burning and extraction of fossil fuels! Make no mistake, the budget is a budget brought down by a government that is turbocharging the climate crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I observe that every single dollar of those public subsidies to encourage the extraction and burning of fossil fuels is also supported by the Australian Labor Party. And what are we now about to see here in this chamber? Both major parties colluding to vote down these Greens amendments that would mean that more Australians get the benefit of a reduction in their insurance premiums as a result of nationalising reinsurance. As we move forward, we will see that more and more Australians need this benefit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll conclude by making a prediction. At some stage, in the not too distant future, the Senate will be here doing exactly what this amendment does: it will be increasing the scope of this scheme until, ultimately—and this will be a great thing if it happens—this country nationalises reinsurance for all climate-related so-called natural disasters. That would mean that we nationalise reinsurance with regard to floods, with regard to rising sea levels and with regard to bushfires, and that can't happen quickly enough. It will happen one day; mark my words.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:48</span>):  I want to place on the record Labor's voting position on this amendment. Labor won't be supporting this amendment, but I want to reiterate some of the views I put during the second reading debate. It is not as though this government has not been warned by insurance companies for very many years about the risks posed by climate change to the frequency and intensity of natural disasters. In fact, after our second reading debate, I went upstairs and had a bit of a look, because I remember when IAG—back in 2006!— took a national leadership role, undertook research and put a very public position about what climate change would cost, what it would mean for premiums and what it would mean for the economy. And what did the Howard government do? What did the Abbott government do? What did the Turnbull government do? What did the Morrison government do? Absolutely nothing of substance to address climate change. And here we are, 15 years later—15 years after the insurance companies first started ringing the bell about what climate change would mean for premiums, what it would mean for communities and what it would mean for the economy. Here we are, even in this term of government, with report after report having been provided to this government—privately commissioned and publicly commissioned reviews about the costs and risks, the problems of underinsurance that arise from that and the economic challenges that that presents to communities, particularly in northern Australia. Here we are, probably in the very last day of the Senate sitting before the election, and the government are finally getting around to legislating their promise, but not with any data on the public record, of course, and not with any data on the table—they just all voted against putting on the table the data that underpins their policy decision—but wanting this Senate to support their position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, we will support the legislation; we'll vote for it. We want the relief that is promised by the government to flow through to communities as quickly as possible. We don't intend to hold up this bill by supporting the Greens amendments. The Greens amendments are a very, very significant change indeed to the scope of the program that's proposed by government. They are of uncertain cost. We have no information about what the Greens' proposal would cost for the scheme, and we've got no information about what it would mean for policyholders and consumers. We're not prepared to hold up the bill. Labor would look at the inclusion of flood coverage as one of the terms in the statutory review that will already take place as a consequence of this legislation's passage, but we do not intend to vote for the amendments today. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:51</span>):  Can I just add one quick point as well? A few days ago, the Greens flagged their intention to move these amendments, and I want to put on the record that our spokesperson on these matters, the member for Kingsford Smith, Mr Thistlethwaite, wrote to the Greens, indicating that we thought that the extension of this pool to the flood areas was an idea worth considering. He wrote to the Greens, expressing that and asking them to advise us what the cost of such an amendment would be: What would be the cost to taxpayers? What would be the cost to insurance policyholders? You'll be shocked to know, Madam Chair, that the response from the Greens was: 'There won't be any cost.' Of course, that's Greens economics for you: you can do things, and they don't cost any money. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator McAllister has indicated and as I indicated in my second reading contribution, we do think that it is worth considering extending the reinsurance pool to areas that suffer from floods, but I think that, if we're going to do that, we should have some idea of what it's going to cost. It's not surprising that the Greens don't think that's worth considering. We think the responsible way to proceed is to support the reinsurance pool as it is currently proposed and to consider this possible extension as part of the statutory review, when we can understand what the cost would be to the taxpayer and to insurance policyholders. I think it's very important that people understand why Labor has taken the position that it has. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might just very quickly also note that it's disappointing that the second reading amendment that I moved was defeated by One Nation and the government. That amendment simply asked the government to come clean and release the modelling which they claim shows how much North Queenslanders will save as a result of the reinsurance pool. I asked Senator Hume to release this information at estimates, and amazingly she told the estimates hearing that it was not in the public interest for North Queenslanders to see the modelling that the government say they have about the savings that people will receive. That's why we moved the amendment, to try to get the government to release the modelling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have been making all sorts of claims in the media about how much people will save, but they refuse to release the proof that they say they have. I have to say that I'm extremely disappointed that One Nation voted with them to stop that information being released. As I have mentioned many, many times in this chamber, One Nation love to run around North Queensland pretending they're on the side of battlers in North Queensland. What they've done here today is vote with their allies in the Liberal-National coalition to stop North Queenslanders being able to see how much they will actually save from this reinsurance pool. One Nation is now in on this with the government in saying that North Queenslanders can't be trusted to see the information that the government say they have about what people will save. That is very disappointing, but it is true to form, because we know, at the end of the day, that One Nation is just another arm of the LNP. And they've rolled over and backed their LNP mates once more.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:54</span>):  I want to put on the record Labor's excuse for not voting for this bill and how their excuse is not supported by the communication and the discussion that the Greens had had with the Labor Party. In fact, Labor asked us: what would be the additional cost to government? We replied that there would be no additional cost. As was noted in the speech on the bill, the scheme has been designed to be cost neutral to the government over time because, basically, although this is government reinsurance changing who pays for the insurance, there will still be insurance purchased by people. It will reduce the cost of insurance from these massive events by, essentially, nationalising that insurance, but the cost is designed to be neutral over time. Expanding the scope of the scheme to include all flood damage wouldn't impact upon this objective. The Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation would price the additional flood damage risk on a cost-neutral basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Insurance is a really interesting representative of the issues that we are facing by living in a climate emergency, and the issues are not going to go away. The costs to Australian society and the costs globally of our climate emergency are going to continue to increase, and the reality of the floods that we have been experiencing over the past months are just an indicator of what we face in this country. It's not just flood damage from cyclones, as has been shown with the floods across Queensland and New South Wales in recent months. None of these would have been eligible for this insurance scheme because they're not cyclone related. But we know that the impact of the climate emergency is going to be increasing intensity and increasing frequency of flood events not just from cyclones but from those heavy downpours. Frankly the science shows why they are happening. It's because we have got a warmer climate and there is more moisture in the atmosphere, so there is more ability for these flood events to occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need—and this is the only way to be dealing with this—is for Australia to be playing its part globally, to be acting at emergency speed, to be safeguarding our future and to be reducing the damage from our climate emergency, and that means we've got to get out of the mining, the burning and the export of coal, gas and oil—full stop. That is what the science says. It's the only way that we're going to tackle the damage and the loss that is being felt by Australians and that is being felt around the world. Any government that is trying to delude themselves that there is any other way out is just that—deluded—and they are misrepresenting the situation to the Australian community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very clear that we do not have a carbon budget left. There is no time to waste. We need to have an emergency shift and an emergency transition to get out of the mining, the burning and the export of coal, gas and oil. That is the reality that humanity is facing, and that's what this parliament needs to face up to. We need to work out how to do it in the way that best supports workers in that shift, and the Greens have got plans on the table as to how we would support workers who are currently working in those industries to be transitioned into new industries. We need to work out how to cope with the fact that there is already that climate change which is locked in. We're going to see floods, fires and other natural disasters due to the climate emergency continuing. Hence, measures like this reinsurance pool are important, but the reality is that they're not going to be enough. The only thing that is going to be taking the required action is to be getting out of the mining, the burning and export of fossil fuel, and both parties in this government need to realise that and need to be joining the Greens in taking the action that's required, if we are going to safeguard our future.</span>

Along with the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, the government supports the passage of this bill without amendment and, therefore, will be opposing this amendment. Insurance affordability from cyclones has been a longstanding issue in the north of our country. The ACCC found that the main driver of high premiums in northern Australia was a higher natural hazard risk primarily driven by cyclones. Including all flood damage in a reinsurance pool would likely reduce the premium reductions available to residents in northern Australia, and we know that in other jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, flood reinsurance pools have required a levy to ensure financial viability. We will be opposing the amendment.</span>

Senator Patrick is right: there are about 15 bills that are being passed here. My grave concern is on one of them, the Offshore Petroleum (Laminaria and Corallina Decommissioning Cost Recovery Levy) Bill 2021. That has been stuffed up by government. The fact is that that is costing us $4 million a week, and that should actually be discussed in this parliament to see what is happening there.</span>

                  </a>  Just on the ruling, this motion was moved at the normal point in terms of the transition of debate in the Senate, immediately following the conclusion of a division. To accommodate the wishes of the crossbench to put opinions, leave was granted. However, leave was granted in the midst of a motion that had already been moved for the question to be put, and so I would ask that the question be put in accordance with the motion that had been put to the chamber.</span>

                  </a>  At the moment, because we are under the current standing order, we are actually at senators' statements. I appreciate you're attempting to move a motion. Under that part of the current program, no divisions can take place. We agreed that when we put senators' statements in. However, I understand that a division can take place if leave is granted. Because we don't currently have any amendment before the chair we are at senators' statements. You can allow for a division if a senator seeks leave and that leave is agreed to.</span>

                  </a>  Just to clarify—I understand you have taken advice and obviously the opposition will support the ruling that's based on the clerk's advice. As I understand it, the fact that this has not been voted on means we now return to the red unamended—the government will have to consider how it wishes to deal with that—which means we move to senators' statements now, unless the chamber gives Senator Birmingham leave for the division to occur. I would infer from the previous contributions that that is unlikely to occur. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  I rise this afternoon to speak about Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the need for the global community to pressure Russia to end the war and withdraw its forces. For those senators who are not aware, my surname, Bilyk, is Ukrainian. It comes from my husband, Robert, whose father emigrated decades ago from Ukraine. Not only does Robert have family ties to Ukraine, but he is an active member of Tasmania's Ukrainian community, and I'm a regular attendee and speaker at Ukrainian community events. I speak to Ukrainians on a regular basis. I hear them speak with patriotic pride about their motherland, but I also hear their anguish and their grief about what their families and close friends are going through. So the situation in Ukraine, as you might imagine, is a very personal one for me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While Ukraine used to be part of the USSR, most Ukrainians have always had a sense of their own unique identity and culture, and Ukrainian language is clearly distinguishable from Russian. Sadly, the recent invasion of Ukraine is a culmination of a long series of attacks by Russia on the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity since it gained independence in 1991. Russia was suspected to be behind the poisoning of Viktor Yushchenko before he was elected President of Ukraine in 2005. In 2010 Russian backed Viktor Yanukovych was elected President in an election fraught with allegations of fraud and voter intimidation. He was removed from power by the Maidan revolution in 2014. Millions of Ukrainians protested, and they were met with batons, tear gas and bullets. More than 100 died and over 1,000 others were injured. Shortly after the revolution, Russia illegally annexed Crimea and gave support to separatist militia in Donetsk and Luhansk. It was these Russian-backed rebels who illegally shot down Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 on its way to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam, killing 298 passengers and crew, including 38 Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the invasion of Ukraine it is estimated that over 6,000 civilians have died, according to Ukrainian authorities. The civilian death toll is so high because Russian forces have targeted areas clearly identified for use by civilians. They've destroyed apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, civilian vehicles, ambulances and shopping centres and fired on civilians trying to flee to safety. It's these actions that prompted US President Joe Biden to call Vladimir Putin a war criminal. While I understand the difficulty of gathering evidence of war crimes in the midst of war, it is vital that every effort is made to investigate these hideous crimes and to bring the perpetrators to justice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To give you an idea of the hell that Ukrainians are going through, I will share a few stories that came to me through the Tasmanian Ukrainian community. I advise anyone listening that they might want to stop now, because some of these stories are more than distressing. The first story is that of Sergei, who was staying with family in Cherkasy. Sergei and a group of friends tried to flee the Kyiv region after staying in an underground shelter for days. The group was caught by Russian soldiers and they were tortured. The soldiers had checked their mobile phones and, after finding patriotic messages on their phones, shot one of Sergei's friends in front of the rest of the group. Sergei was released, but only after having his teeth smashed with a rifle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another story is that of Olga and her seven-year-old son. After the war started they sheltered in the basement of their apartment building every day. It was dark and cold there. It's winter in Ukraine, and I'm sure everyone can appreciate, from the images of the snow covered streets on TV, exactly how cold it was. In this ordeal, Olga's seven-year-old son stopped talking; he just remained silent for the whole time. They were running low on food and supplies but couldn't find transportation to leave. Driving away was way too dangerous. What eventually prompted them to come out of the basement and to leave was the terror of a missile striking their apartment building. So they managed to get on a bus full of civilians heading for the Polish border, but the bus also came under attack by Russian forces. They changed buses six times in their journey and finally arrived at the border, thankfully uninjured, after two days of travel. During those two days, they had no food and no sleep and they stayed overnight in a tent by a fire in subzero temperatures, all the while with the constant fear of another attack. Thankfully, Olga and her son are now safe. I was also told of another family in Kherson. Kherson was captured early in the war and has been occupied by Russian forces for weeks. During the early days of the invasion, they saw Russians shooting at cars. They are now too afraid to leave their apartment, despite running low on food and medicine. Some of the locals have held rallies to protest the invasion, but Russian soldiers have used tear gas and fired bullets to disperse crowds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I actually think that a lot of these stories would horrify many ordinary Russians. But, of course, Russians don't get to hear them. Russians who rely on broadcast television as their main source of news are being fed a steady stream of propaganda, including from Russian state TV, which is a mouthpiece of the government. Television and radio broadcasters who have had the courage to report the truth have been shut down. A new law threatens journalists with jail if they report anything about the war that goes against the reporting of the official Russian sources. In fact, media outlets can go against this law simply by referring to the military operation as a war or an invasion. Russia is also censoring social media at a phenomenal expense. It begs the question: would Vladimir Putin's actions be tolerated by a truly democratic Russia with a free media?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the Russian government's efforts to control the narrative, many Russians know that what is being done in Ukraine in their name is wrong. According to human rights groups, more than 8,000 Russians have been arrested for publicly protesting the war in Ukraine. It's a small number compared to Russia's population, but, when protesters face the prospect of being imprisoned for up to 15 years, it takes a tremendous amount of courage to speak out. I commend the bravery of those protesters, and I recognise that not all Russians bear responsibility for the actions of the Russian state committed in their name. Russia is a democracy in name only, and many ordinary Russians are also victims of Vladimir Putin's despotic regime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's right and it's just that Australia has stepped up and joined its allies in not just opposing the invasion diplomatically but also putting real pressure on Vladimir Putin's regime. This conflict is happening on the other side of the world, but it's still Australia's concern for a number of reasons. Australia has a responsibility to its citizens, who include thousands of Australians of Ukrainian descent, just like my father-in-law, whose friends and family are in peril. We also have a responsibility as good global citizens to do our part to maintain peace and order in the world, not just in our region but across the globe. But those are not the only reasons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Russia's unprovoked aggression is an issue that concerns Australia for the same reasons it should concern every sovereign nation. Its actions go against the rules based order that has maintained relative peace and stability in the world since World War II. Not only does the global community need to send a strong message to Russia that their actions will not be tolerated; we need to ensure that the price they pay economically and militarily is so high that they are pressured to withdraw and they and other countries are effectively deterred from taking similar action in the future. Labor stands shoulder to shoulder with the government in applying pressure on Russia in the form of targeted economic sanctions and providing support to Ukraine through the creation of special humanitarian visas and the supply of lethal and non-lethal aid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also thank the Ukrainian diaspora. Through their representative organisations, such as the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations, the work they are doing to support their community—I have witnessed it firsthand—is just amazing. The Association of Ukrainians in Tasmania, an organisation which is entirely volunteer run, has done an excellent job providing information and updates on visa options and application processes and where to go for financial assistance, counselling and other support services. They've been raising funds to support their countrymen and holding weekly rallies on the lawn of the Tasmanian parliament and in Launceston. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>The ultimate responsibility for this war and the bloodshed and suffering that has followed and will follow rests squarely on the shoulders of Vladimir Putin and his regime. The global community have shown they will not just stand idly by while he invades a sovereign democratic nation. They will act, they will not forget and they will ensure that Mr Putin and his supporters pay the price. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="font-weight:bold;">):</span>  Last night, the Treasurer handed down the 2022-23 federal budget, which delivers Australia's plan for a stronger future: cost-of-living relief now; a long-term economic plan which creates jobs; record investments in essential services; and stronger defence and national security. This is a budget which delivers for all Australians. The government recognises households are facing cost-of-living pressures as a result of the invasion of Ukraine and ongoing global supply chain issues from COVID, so, as part of the budget, we've announced some very significant cost-of-living measures which will be delivered as temporary and practical support for households right across this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the next six months, Australians will save 22c a litre every time they fill up their car. A family with two cars that fills up once a week could save around $30 a week, or around $700 over the next six months. This cut in fuel excise, which took effect from midnight last night, will flow through to the bowser over the next two weeks. This temporary reduction in fuel excise will not come at a cost to road funding, very importantly. We will see more than $12 billion spent in the coming year on roads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a new one-off $420 cost-of-living tax offset, which will benefit more than 10 million low- and middle-income earners. Taxpayers who are already receiving the low- and middle-income tax offset will now receive up to $1,500, and couples up to $3,000, from 1 July this year. There is a one-off new $250 cost-of-living payment which will be delivered within weeks to six million Australians. Pensioners, carers, veterans, jobseekers, eligible self-funded retirees and concession card holders will all benefit. Together with existing indexation arrangements, this will see a single pensioner receive more than $500 in additional support over the next six months, just when they need it the most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Very proudly, the Morrison government is helping more Australians to own a home and to combat and deal with housing affordability. Of course, we have HomeBuilder, the First Home Super Saver Scheme and the home guarantee scheme. But now, in the budget, there is a doubling of the home guarantee scheme, which will provide 50,000 places a year. This will help single parents to buy a home with a deposit as low as two per cent and will help more homebuyers to buy a home with a deposit as low as five per cent. I know this is going to be very much welcomed in the region I represent, as patron senator for the electorates of Bendigo, Ballarat, Corangamite, Corio and Gorton, all very fast-growing areas. Many are moving to these regions, and they are looking for that additional support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a new $2.8 billion investment to increase take-up and completion rates as part of our skills investment, and we'll be providing a $5,000 payment to new apprentices and up to $15,000 in wage subsidies for employers who take them on. There will be $3.7 billion to support an additional 800,000 training places.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, small business is a massive recipient of the measures in our budget. We know small and family businesses are the absolute lifeblood of our economy right across this nation, employing nearly eight million Australians. From budget night, for every $100 spent by a small business on training, those businesses will receive a $120 tax deduction—120 per cent. Of course, this will drive more resilience and more jobs right across the nation. We're also backing small businesses which are embracing the digital revolution by providing the same tax deduction for investments in digital technologies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local manufacturing—a very big passion of mine—of course receives a huge shot in the arm, with a wide range of investments to drive collaboration between our universities and CSIRO. Of course, in Victoria we have the incredible announcement of the manufacture of mRNA vaccines. And there's a new patent box to support the agriculture and low-emissions-technology sectors. So that's going to make a huge difference in terms of innovation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The regions—I'm proudly a regional senator for Victoria—have received unprecedented regional investment. There's a new $7.4 billion investment in more dams and water projects to improve vital water security. There's a new $2 billion regional accelerator program. Of course, there are the transformational investments in other parts of the country—the Hunter, the Pilbara, the Northern Territory and North and Central Queensland—and a wonderful $1.3 billion telecommunications package. I know our incredible Liberal candidate for Corangamite, Stephanie Asher, has been advocating up hill and down dale for more funding for mobile coverage in places like Armstrong Creek and the Bellarine Peninsula in Corangamite. She's doing an incredible job. We are very hopeful that we will see more news about how that $811 million in mobile connectivity is going to be distributed across the nation. We've both been advocating for an extension of the PUMP program, the Peri-Urban Mobile Program, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed, as is Stephanie, that we're going to see some very significant funding flow into our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, massive infrastructure projects are underway in all the areas of regional Victoria that I represent as patron senator. The Waurn Ponds to South Geelong rail duplication receives another $274 million in this year's budget. Stage 1 of the Barwon Heads Road upgrade receives $105 million. There is $37 million flowing into the budget for Geelong Fast Rail, so we are going to see stage 1 construction begin next year. That's the section between Werribee and Laverton. When critics talk about pork-barrelling in Corangamite, this really does remind them what an absolute joke it is. That $2 billion has gone into western Melbourne, which has been so badly ignored by Daniel Andrews and state Labor. We are very proud of what we are doing to deliver faster, more affordable and more efficient train services, including through our massive $2 billion investment in Geelong Fast Rail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some other very significant investments. In the electorate of Gorton, $20 million is flowing to the Melbourne Intermodal Terminal's planning and development in this year's budget. In Ballarat we've got $31 million flowing to the Western Highway project for the Ballarat to Stawell duplication, which is a very significant investment as well. There's also significant money flowing into the Bendigo electorate, including to the Bendigo-Echuca rail line and the Sunraysia Highway upgrade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a budget, as I said at the start of my contribution, which is delivering for all Australians. In health, Medicare is guaranteed, with bulk-billing rates at a record high. We've now approved more than 2,800 new or amended listings on the PBS. Following on from the very significant $2.3 billion investment in mental health, we're seen more funding flow for community based treatment centres, headspace services and digital mental health support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a massive women's safety, health and economic security package, including another $1.3 billion to combat violence against women and children. There are more frontline services, more investment in emergency accommodation, and support for legal and health services. This builds on the incredible investment that we have made in many, many different ways for Australian women. We've now also included an enhanced Paid Parental Leave scheme, providing more accessibility and, in particular, standing up for sole parents—single mothers and fathers—who can now access the full 20 weeks of paid parental leave.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our commitment to the NDIS and disability continues. NDIS funding grows every year. We're making an even further massive contribution to older Australians, with more home-care packages, additional training places and personal care workers. There's record funding for education, for environment and for national security and defence, which is incredibly important, including the 10-year investment in our cybercapabilities. Only the Morrison government can be trusted to deliver a stronger economy and a safer Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="296215" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COX</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  If there's one clear message out of last night's budget, it's this: this government has been sold to the highest bidder on our watch and in our name. When Morrison's Treasurer announced the bill last night, it was not a plan. Instead, what we heard was a last-ditch plea for votes in the dying days of this shambles of a government. It doesn't take much to see through the lies and the bluster with this mob.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While last night's speech began with Morrison's Treasurer paying lip-service to the climate floods, extreme climate events like these are being fuelled by coal and gas—dirty, polluting fossil fuels that Liberal and Labor only want to increase. This budget gives $37.6 billion of taxpayer money in fossil fuel subsidies, which will go directly into the profits of the massive corporations that bankroll the Liberal Party's coffers. Instead of investing in the restoration of Australia's biodiversity, public money will instead be spent on bypassing environmental protection to fast-track environmental approval for their fossil fuel mates. Further billions will be spent on dams that will destroy critical habitats and pollute our Great Barrier Reef.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you read the budget, it's clear that they can't keep people safe and they can't manage the economy. They are selling us out. There are over three million people living in poverty. There are millions of people trapped in insecure work on low wages and in unaffordable housing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the people who are worried about bushfires, about how they're going to cope with the next heatwave or how to rebuild their homes after worsening disasters, once again, you have been abandoned because the government is spending more money on fossil fuels that are accelerating these climate catastrophes. What a joke! Are they trying to buy their way back into office? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their claims on wages are farcical. Wages growth has been below three per cent for the entire time this government has been in power. But now we're expected to believe that the wages are going to suddenly grow by five per cent over the next three months. Well, here's the real story. This budget funds and fuels the climate crisis. Morrison and his cronies are hell-bent on destroying country, the land, skies and waters that First Nations people have cared for and sustained for generations. Our environment is in crisis, and this budget is making our land sicker. It makes housing more expensive—$13 billion of public money is going into housing investors, but nothing to build more affordable homes. It won't lift wages; it will make the cost of living increase and it will lock us into tax cuts only for the wealthy. This is another budget for the billionaires and the big corporations. They are looking after their mates, after their donors, while squandering our precious resources. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The climate crisis is caused by mining and the burning of coal and gas. They don't just want us to burn more of it; they also want us to pay for it. Coal and gas corporations are not only getting huge handouts; they're offshoring their profits tax free, and it's costing every single Australian. Twenty-three gas companies who sell gas overseas together made $49 billion in revenue. Between them they didn't pay a single cent of tax. If that were you and me, this would in fact be criminal. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2020-21, Woodside donated $232,000 to the Liberal-National and Labor parties. In return, they've given them handouts to build one of the worst gas projects in the world. They're robbing teachers, nurses, childcare educators and aged-care workers to pay Woodside, Santos and Whitehaven. That's not how you manage the economy. You can't keep people safe if you keep backing more coal and gas. Right now there are 114 new coal and gas projects in the pipeline across this continent, on country. These projects will increase the amount of pollution in the atmosphere by 1.3 billion tonnes a year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, in a mere 240 years since colonisation, our people have watched in horror and dismay as the governments of this country, one after another, have acted in their own short-term interests. This government fails to see the full picture. It's failing our children and our future generations to come. For First Nations people, this budget is just more of the same. If the government is serious about justice and equality for First Nations people, there needs to be real investment for First Nations communities. Our people are dying in custody. There is no treaty with First Nations people, only bandaid solutions from a government with no real vision for the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nowhere is this felt more than in my own state of Western Australia. Western Australia is already one of the hottest places in the world. It's been identified as a climate hotspot. This year alone the Pilbara hit 50 degrees, and the number of days per year over 40 degrees in Perth has doubled. But this government isn't just fast-tracking projects like the Scarborough gas project; it's also giving them in this budget an additional $300 million to fund gas projects in the Northern Territory. Scarborough alone won't just wreck the planet, but it will do irreversible damage to the Murujuga rock art and the Seven Sisters songline. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So your taxes are paying to destroy our cultural heritage. Shame! That's why we have to kick the Liberals out and put the Greens into the balance of power. We have a plan to build one million affordable homes. We will cap rents. We will give renters more rights and we will abolish the outrageous tax breaks for people who are investing in their fourth, fifth, 20th and 30th homes, driving up prices so other people are forced to live in their cars. We will ban all new coal and gas projects and invest in the transition to a cleaner, greener economy, and we will pay for it by making billionaires and big corporations pay their fair share of tax. And that's not all. With the balance of power, the Greens will get dental health and mental health into Medicare. Where this government has let us down, the Greens will keep fighting for our communities, for our climate and for a safer future for all of us.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  I'd like to firstly commend Senator Cox for bringing to the attention of the people of Queensland, especially, what the realities will be if the Labor Party win the next election. I was listening very carefully to Senator Cox's contribution the other day, when she talked about the sharing of power in the event that Labor form the next government in this place. That's the reality, and Senator Cox pursued that theme in her contribution today. The Greens will use their numbers—and it doesn't matter what Senator Farrell thinks—to take the Labor Party to the extreme Left. That is the reality of the situation in the event there is a change in government in this place at the next election. The people of Queensland should consider their choice very, very carefully, because the only way in which the Labor Party will be able to get legislation through this place to pursue their agenda—to abolish the ABCC and do whatever else they want to do—is to do deals with the Australian Greens. And that is a potential—</span>

                  </a>  Senator Farrell, I will take that interjection: I will certainly not be voting for the abolition of the ABCC, and I believe you wouldn't, either, if you had the power not to. The reality is that, if the Labor Party wins the next election, it will be—to use Senator Cox's words—power sharing with the Australian Greens. That is the reality that faces the Australian people at the next election. So, Senator Cox, I commend you on that contribution, and I hope that the people of Queensland have listened very, very carefully. That's the reality of life in the event that the Labor Party wins the next election, and it's not pretty for the people of Queensland. It's not pretty for their jobs or their economic prosperity or for all those industries which provide so many jobs and generate so much wealth and opportunity for the people of Queensland. That is the reality in the event that the Labor Party wins the election: power sharing—I'm quoting the Greens—between the Greens and the Labor Party, in the event that Mr Albanese becomes the next Prime Minister of this country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to make a contribution in relation to the situation in Myanmar, which I'm sure all senators in this place are deeply concerned about. In the last week I've had the opportunity to attend a roundtable discussion with members of the Australian Myanmar community in Queensland. Firstly, I'd like to sincerely thank them for taking the time to meet with me and to convey personally their concerns in relation to what is a deteriorating situation in Myanmar. In this context, I'd also like to associate my remarks with the comments of Senator Bilyk in relation to the situation in Ukraine. I think Senator Bilyk has very effectively conveyed the concerns many of us have with respect to that awful, awful situation in a region that has borne so much tragedy over the last hundred years.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the situation in Myanmar I commend to all senators a report recently released by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The report is dated 15 March 2022, and the summary says:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Myanmar is caught in a downward spiral of violence characterized by the increasingly brutal repression of individuals actually or seemingly opposed to military rule, by violent resistance to the coup and by several active non-international armed conflicts. Action must be taken to stem the pace at which individuals are being targeted by the military authorities and stripped of their rights, their lives and their livelihoods.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will emphasise that point: 'Myanmar is caught in a downward spiral of violence.' In this report, there is a shocking amount of evidence of the human rights abuses and violations which are occurring in Myanmar.

The Australian government is providing 2,000 additional visas, under Australia's humanitarian program, for Myanmar refugees. It is fit and proper that we do so, because our Myanmar diaspora—our Myanmar community in Australia—make such a wonderful contribution to Australia in so many ways. In addition, there is going to be an increase in targeted aid for Burmese in refugee camps in border regions. Indeed, this financial year, Australia will deliver over $95 million of assistance to the people of Myanmar.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WALSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  Last night's budget was nothing less than sugar and spin. It contained nothing but short-term, one-off sugar hits which do absolutely nothing to fix the real challenges that Australians are facing every single day under this government. The Morrison government has said they want the Australian people to give them another 10 years. They say it's time to stick to the plan and that now is not the time to change course. But Australians cannot afford another 10 years of this government. They literally can't afford it because, for the last decade, this government has done nothing to address the challenges that real Australians face, nothing to help them live better, nothing to deal with the rising costs of living, nothing to get wages moving and nothing to deal with rising job insecurity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night, while the Treasurer and the Prime Minister congratulated themselves on their budget full of short-term pay-offs and no long-term plan, I sat with five aged-care workers—Theresa, Curtis, Xin, Karen and Marina—and I got their response firsthand. Aged-care workers were once again completely ignored in last night's budget. I was with them as they waited for any sign from this government that they had any plan to fix aged care, any sign that this government finally recognised the sacrifices that aged-care workers have made over the last two years or any sign that this government understood that at the heart of the aged-care crisis is a workforce crisis. I was with them when they heard promises of further one-off pay-offs in this budget, when they still haven't received the last pay-off that they were promised by the Morrison government. I was with them when they realised that, once again, this government refused to acknowledge their value, their skill and their sacrifice, and they were angry. They were angry that once again they have been neglected, that once again they have been undervalued and that once again they have been left behind by this government. They were angry, but they were not surprised. This is exactly what they have come to expect after 10 years under this government. It's what they've had for the last 10 years: no respect, no action and no plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aged-care workers can't afford to wait for the Morrison government to find a plan, when they are still waiting for bonuses that they were promised back in February and when they are literally sleeping on couches and living in caravans because, on their wages, they can't even afford to pay rent. Aged-care workers can't wait for the Morrison government to fix their problems, when they are spending their days feeding our loved ones but can't afford to feed their own. That's why aged-care workers across the country are taking matters into their own hands. They are standing up and demanding real action to fix the aged-care crisis and to fix aged-care wages, because they are done working without enough staff, they are done being exhausted and burnt out, and they are done being undervalued. They are taking action. They are taking to the streets. They are standing up and they are speaking out. They are taking action because this government refuses to. These dedicated aged-care workers are standing up not just for themselves but for the residents and the families who rely on them. They know that the only way to change aged care is to change the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand with the aged-care workers who are standing up and speaking out today. Aged-care workers are not alone in their anger and their frustration with this budget. Australians need more than one-off pay-offs from this government. Is this all the government really has after nearly 10 years in office—one-off pay-offs? That is it? What Australians really need is a pay rise, because everything is going up under this government while wages continue to go backwards. People are struggling to even afford the basics. Under this government more people than ever before on record are having to work two, three and even four jobs just to make ends meet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the last almost 10 years of this government we have had the lowest wage growth on record, and it is set to continue under this government and under its budget. On top of that, on top of the low wages, there are three million Australians in insecure jobs and the government has nothing for them, nothing. It is a complete disgrace. It is a disgrace, because after almost a decade the Morrison government still has no plan to get wages moving. Last night's budget literally had nothing on wages except a sentence in the beginning. Sitting back and waiting for wages to move on their own is not a plan. It is not enough. The short-term bandaid responses by the Morrison government are simply not enough. One-off pay-offs instead of real pay rises will not cut it. But offering short-term pay-offs is the only plan that this government has. It's all they can offer Australians. Last night's budget was full of them: one-off, short-term, vote-buying pay-offs. This is not the plan Australians need to ease the cost of living. This is not a plan to deliver good, secure jobs. This is not a plan to get wages moving. This is not a plan for the next 10 years. It is barely a plan for the next eight weeks. Australians do not buy it. They do not buy it. Australians cannot afford these quick political fixes from the Morrison government when what they need are long-term plans to get their wages moving.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is all the Morrison government has to offer for the next 10 years. This is a government that is ready for opposition. I asked Australians what they thought of the prospect of another 10 years of the Morrison government: Jane, an early childhood educator, and Cooper, a hospo worker. Jane and Cooper were very clear. Cooper said, 'I am terrified of the prospect of living any more of my life under a Morrison government.' Jane said: 'We can't afford another three years. It's a frightening prospect. It would be a catastrophe.' Terrifying, frightening and a catastrophe—this is Prime Minister Morrison's Australia. This is it. This is what Australian workers are saying about their government. They quite literally fear another term of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government says they've done a good job with the economy and that we should stay the course. The lived experience of millions of Australians proves otherwise. Australians have gone backwards over the last almost decade of this do-nothing government. Only Labor will stand with essential workers, essential workers like Jane, Cooper and Grace. Grace is an aged-care worker who I spoke to who is also terrified of the prospect of another 10 years of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is only Labor that will stand with these workers. It is only Labor that will fight to end job insecurity. It is only Labor that will lower the cost of living for Australians. Only an Albanese Labor government will get wages moving in the right direction. Labor knows how difficult the last few years have been for Australians, because we have been out there listening to Australians. We know that Australians simply cannot afford the Morrison government. They literally can't afford it—not for another day, not for another three years, let alone the decade that this government wants Australians to give them. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  It's been over a year since the royal commission into aged care handed down their report. One of the recommendations of that report was that we should have nurses in aged-care facilities 24/7. It's a very simple idea, and most people can absolutely understand the necessity of such a recommendation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, since October, the government has simply not dealt with this at all. In October I introduced an amendment to the government's Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 2) Bill to get this crucial recommendation actioned immediately. And what happened? The government stopped the progression of their own bill because they were of the view that I had the numbers in the Senate to pass my amendment to finally help people in aged care by having a nurse available 24/7. That is an absolute disgrace—the government holding up its own bill to avoid implementing a very sensible recommendation of the royal commission. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the aged-care system is in crisis. You don't have to listen to me; the Prime Minister has conceded that. Only recently, we had to send the Australian Defence Force into our aged-care facilities to deal with part of that crisis. Because the government hasn't pushed this legislation, I've tried to work constructively with the minister. I've had a conversation with the minister and I've even conceded to him that, whilst my bill seeks an immediate introduction of the requirement to have nurses in aged-care facilities 24/7, I'm quite happy if we roll it back to the exact recommendation of the royal commission. I offered him that. I said: 'Your bill going through the Senate is an important bill. It makes important changes and it has the support of the Senate. I'd like to help you get that through, and all I'm asking you to do is put in exactly what the royal commission recommended.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The response from my negotiations with the minister was to offer me a review. A review! We've just had a royal commission into aged care and the minister wants to do another review, looking into one of the recommendations. That is a slap in the face for every person in aged care and every person who has a loved one in aged care. Any suggestion that my amendment is at odds with the recommendations of the royal commissioners is just simply wrong. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we're going to have a guillotine motion. That's foreshadowed by the debacle that happened in the chamber just before senators' statements. I foreshadow that, when we next rise to deal with a time motion with a list of 20 bills, I am going to seek to amend that to put the Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response No. 2) Bill on the list. This is too important. We cannot ignore what is happening in our aged-care facilities. Aging is a privilege; it shouldn't be a punishment, but that's exactly what is happening right now. The government could be acting, but they're refusing to. This parliament is about to come to its end without having taken any serious action in relation to the aged-care royal commission recommendations. It's a disgrace and it's a great disservice to all of our loved ones in aged-care facilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to switch to another topic, which is the Murray-Darling Basin. I was up at Tolarno Station a few weeks ago, seeing the wonderful water flowing down the Darling River, but I don't want all of that water to drown out the failure that is the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. The history of this, very simply, is that we get something like 32,000 gigalitres of flow into the Murray and, on average, we're taking out 13,600. That number is decreasing because of climate change. Everyone recognised that we needed to do something about this, and so we started off on a journey to come up with what is now known as the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. The whole purpose of the plan was to return some of that diversion to the river. Originally, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority came up with a scientific range of 3,900 to 7,600 gigalitres, except that was politically wound back to a lesser recovery of 2,750 gigalitres. South Australia weren't having any of it, so they negotiated a change to the Water Act's section 86AA, which returned an additional 450 gigalitres to the river.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What were the key measures? Buybacks were one of the key measures to get water back. We also had supply measures, or SDL projects, and we had the efficiency project. These were supposed to get us the 450. Where are we at? In buybacks, we've actually bought back 2,106 gigalitres, and that's the most efficient way to get recovery. We've got 36 SDL projects, of which only 15 are completed. Of the 605 gigalitres we expected from that part of the plan, we've only recovered 280 gigalitres. The Productivity Commission reported in 2018 that there was huge risk in these projects, and they're absolutely right. Now even the government concedes that six of those projects are likely not to render any return. One of those is the big one at Menindee Lakes. With regard to the efficiency measures—the 450 gigalitres—guess how much water of the 450 has returned for South Australia. It is two gigalitres. Nine years into the plan, two gigalitres is all we have managed to find. It's a mess, and I haven't even started talking about things like the flood plain harvesting that's occurring in northern New South Wales and Queensland and the cotton that's now sprouting on the Murrumbidgee.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the plan comes to its proper conclusion in 2024 and we have to deal with a failed plan that hasn't recovered even the politically manipulated number, we're going to need strong advocates. South Australia's going to need strong advocates in this place. Sadly, we look at what happened with the South Australian election. Although no-one knows who she is, we now have a One Nation representative in the Legislative Council in South Australia. My really big concern is that at the next election One Nation may well have a South Australian representative in the Senate. I can tell you that, when that happens and we have to deal with the closure of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which is a failure, this Queensland-led party will be backing big cotton and big irrigators from Queensland all the way. That's a huge danger to South Australia, and South Australians need to understand that that's what they're staring down the barrel of if indeed One Nation gets someone up in the Senate representing South Australia.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McGRATH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:25</span>):  For many, 'juvenile granulosa cell tumour', or JCT, would be a foreign term. On the other hand, ovarian cancer is something we've all come to know a lot more about in recent years, thanks to advances in research and general awareness. JCT happens to be a rare form of ovarian cancer that accounts for approximately eight to 10 per cent of all ovarian cancers, affecting females as young as infants through to post-menopausal women. This is why volunteers, led by Peter Reaburn, will be riding from Canberra to Melbourne over the course of nine straight days to raise funds for vital ovarian cancer research.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Peter's wife, Claire, was diagnosed with JCT at the age of 53. Claire is the oldest female in the world to have JCT. The youngest was diagnosed in Australia at the age of 11 months. Overall, 94 per cent of patients with JCT are under 30 years of age. Currently, there is no cure for JCT, nor is there significant research to help understand the disease further. At present, clinicians are prescribing treatment methods based on best guess rather than on facts. However, there are strong and amazing people, like Claire, her family and her supporters, who are working tirelessly to raise awareness of JCT. Research is desperately needed, and that is why the team is riding to raise much-needed funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give a special mention to Bec—Claire and Peter's daughter—who wants to emphasise the sheer courage and determination shown by her parents in this fight and their continued efforts to bring awareness to such an important issue. For those who are listening or watching, please head to rocinc.org.au to find out more about this great cause and to donate. Best of luck to Peter, Claire, Bec and the rest of the team in this great endeavour.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be remiss of me not to talk about dams in Queensland, today being the final sitting day of this parliament. Every sitting week, I have risen to talk about Paradise Dam. I welcome the $600 million contribution by the federal government to help fix Labor's mistake in Paradise Dam. Paradise Dam is Australia's worst infrastructure fail. I particularly welcome the funding for the Urannah Dam, a private project in conjunction with government in North Queensland. 'Urannah' is Queensland for 'water' and Urannah is a dam that is going to help grow Queensland. Andrew Wilcox, our new candidate for Dawson, will continue to fight for Urannah, taking on the fight led by George Christensen.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, in Queensland recently we've seen the unedifying spectacle of the Premier sending in goons to the Integrity Commissioner's office to seize a laptop and then have that laptop wiped. This is something out of Putin's Russia. People wonder, 'What is on this laptop?' so I thought I would do a countdown with the one minute that remains to me. This is what people are saying. There are seven reasons: No. 7, there are photos of the former Labor lord mayor accepting bundles of cash in a car park; No. 6 is a list of COVID breaches by members of Labor's cabinet in Queensland; No. 5 is a spreadsheet of all the secret and dodgy donations that the Labor Party has received in Queensland; No. 4 is details of hospital ramping, particularly on a Saturday morning after Labor aligned lobbyists have long lunches at the Port Office with Labor ministers and staffers; No. 3 is Steven Miles and his lack of conscience; No. 2 is Labor's secret plans to raise taxes; and No. 1 is the real Anthony Albanese—the Scarlet Pimpernel of Australian politics! Will the real Anthony Albanese please stand up? Please stand up, Anthony Albanese.</span>

That is of little comfort to people in regional and remote areas of Australia. In Ramingining right now, petrol prices are over $3. Remote middle-eastern Arnhem Land is paying $3. In your budget statement last night, for those covered by CDP—which covers over 40,000 participants across Australia, most of whom are in the Northern Territory and many of whom would be in places like Ramingining—there was no sense of future. You talk about unemployment, but you do not talk about the underemployment. You do not talk about the people that you're leaving behind under failed programs like the Community Development Program. There is no vision and no hope. There are skirmishes and prevention against what has been challenged against this government around the unfairness and the discrimination of CDP. There is nothing in the budget books that says, 'This is what we're going to do.'</span>

Of five trial sites across Australia, one went to the Northern Territory, yet we are the deepest in need with this underfunded, no-hope future program that shows no way out of the disadvantage that we're experiencing in a lot of these communities. The Prime Minister will do and say anything before an election, and even his own side don't trust him to deliver what he promises.</span>

Mr Chau is an Australian citizen who was born in Vietnam and migrated to Sydney after the fall of Saigon. The retired banker was arrested within hours of his arrival in his former country and faced charges of being involved with a 'terrorist activity'. For context, Mr Chau is a member of Viet Tan, a pro-democracy and human rights organisation that Vietnam, curiously, designates as a terrorist organisation. According to his wife, Mr Chau was only in Vietnam to monitor the human rights situations on the ground, to see for himself. But now he faces what Human Rights Watch have likened to a death sentence for someone of his health and age.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who fought communism in the Vietnam War and endured years in a forced labour camp, why would Mr Chau return? According to those close to him, he often expressed a dream of seeing the country he still loves become free and democratic. Amnesty International and others consider Mr Chau to be a prisoner of conscience, targeted and jailed solely for expressing his peaceful political beliefs. It's a frightening reminder that the world can still be a hostile place for those seeking liberty and democracy for others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As you might imagine, Mr Chau's family are very deeply concerned and are tirelessly campaigning for his release and return to his home here in Australia. This cause is firmly supported by the Vietnamese community in Western Australia and, in particular, Mr Dai Nguyen. So I offer my voice in this place in the hope it might highlight and even assist these efforts and to sincerely thank all those who are doing everything they can to see justice.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  The budget that we saw handed down last night is not a serious plan for the future; it's just a six-month sugar hit, followed by continuing wage stagnation, $3 billion in hidden cuts, and a series of diluted projects and extended delivery times buried deep in those papers. Wages are going backwards. The government should be ashamed of the smoke and mirrors that have been put forward in this budget and the rhetoric told to the people without an understanding or clarity that the sugar hits are going to end. It is short-term. It is short-sighted. This is not going to help people in this country. This is not going to provide the structural change and support that we need to bolster wages and to let people build for the future. These challenging sugar hits are bribery of the Australian public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's be really clear: Australians are not stupid. They are very, very aware of what is going on here. They know they cannot trust the hollow promises of this government. You only have to look over the last nine years to see that. They said wages would grow; they didn't. They said they would introduce a national anticorruption commission; that didn't happen, and we are 1,200 days on from that promise. In the budget papers last night, there was a big zero, in black and white, for the anticorruption commission. And if there's anyone that needs an anticorruption commission, it is this government.</span>

Of course it upset the Liberal Party, and of course it upset the Prime Minister. Hence he came out and said, 'It's from a scorned woman.' I can say: it's not. It's from a woman who has given a lot to this parliament and who has represented the people of New South Wales to the best of her ability. It's about talking about a prime minister who is not in touch with the Liberal Party or the people of this nation, who has lost the values of conservatism, and that's exactly what has upset Senator Fierravanti-Wells. The Liberal Party is not the Liberal Party that should be there to represent the views and values of this nation on the conservative side. It's a party that has been taken over by the moderates and those on the left. It's a party full of factions. It's a party that is trying to get rid of the true conservatives, and that's why a lot of their voters are coming across to One Nation and supporting us.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It wasn't the Prime Minister who wanted the apprenticeship scheme, though he stands there talking about it. It was One Nation's apprenticeship scheme. We have over 100,000 apprentices out there because of One Nation. It wasn't the Liberal Party that stood up for many issues that have been supported by One Nation. The Prime Minister stands up and says he's against vaccine mandates, but in the supply budget he wants to give money to vaccinate children from birth to four years of age. Yet he does absolutely nothing to listen to the Australian people who do not want to be forced, coerced or blackmailed into getting a vaccine into their bodies against their will. This is not a prime minister for the people.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  In these uncertain times, with Russia brutally invading Ukraine and with China's communist dictatorship threatening democratic Taiwan and buying favour with the Solomon Islands, we need people of substance, stability and strength in the leadership of our country. The superficial headline-seekers never cut it. They'll opportunistically praise the war criminal Putin one day and then quickly and hypocritically change their tune when the invaders of the Ukraine become pariahs. Consistency and the capacity to read the writing on the wall is what is required. The backbone and the spleen to call things out early enough, even if it doesn't win you friends, is what we need. Leadership isn't about cheap populism. Leadership is about warning, preparing and safeguarding with a view to the future. It's about honestly telling things as they are. Last night's budget did exactly those things by bolstering our defence and national security even further after Labor's disgraceful neglect and underinvestment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who has consistently called out the brutal Chinese communist dictatorship, highlighting its human rights abuses—from organ harvesting and religious persecution to genocide of the Uighurs—along with its devious foreign interference in our institutions, I've been falsely called all sorts of names, gleefully parroted by certain elements in the media. Today those voices are silent—shamefully silent, one hopes. Today the stands that some of us have taken are fully vindicated, and the government's recognition in last night's budget of the threats confirms to me that we are on the right track to build an even stronger future for all Australians with the defence capacity needed.</span>

I've worked with many in this and the other place who genuinely want to make a positive difference to people's lives. In fact, some are in this chamber right now. You know who you are, and I thank you for the good work that you do. This place should be all about doing good, and you all meet this in spades. Of course, there are also a good number who excel in the art of frustration and will do anything to stop the government of the day from achieving success, and there are those on both sides who particularly like to eat their own. This is such a pointless exercise that damages their reputation and their party's reputation and, of course, damages the way in which the public views us.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">To me, public hearings are the best part of this job as they often bring about change even before government formally responds to them. Unfortunately, government has many hundreds that they have not responded to during this parliament. Sitting weeks are mostly an exercise in frustrating the passage of bills at all costs. Being on the crossbench has enabled me to push for specific inquiries and projects. Some highlights are the digital platforms inquiry, IVF clinics data disclosure, FASD campaigns and numerous projects that will make a difference to those with cancer. I've also worked with the government on palliative care initiatives, and I'm very pleased that one key project in particular was announced in last night's budget.</span>

From my office, I sincerely thank Rachel Pace, Renee Browne, Jonathon Deans, Maria Moscaritolo, Patrizia Casbarra and Rebecca Hamon.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I do want to give the government a basting because you would think the government should be able to deliver a budget. There are people sitting here in the chamber today. The parliament is open. We've got the public back here. They had to put petrol in their cars. I bet they were screaming as they were paying through the nose for petrol. Last night they might have been lulled into a false sense of confidence in this government that they are going to get a little bit of relief at the bowser. Pay attention because it might not come through for two weeks. What sorts of mechanisms have they got in place to make sure it's actually going to get to us and help us in our hip pockets? Watch more and more closely, because, not too far along after May—once we hit September—that's gone. They won't be talking about that. They will say that they're there for you, because that's what they say all of the time, but the reality is that this government is blind to the reality of what Australians are really going through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget is, as the shadow Treasurer described it, a panicked, desperate and tapped-out budget by a panicked, desperate and tapped-out government. They have embedded in this budget $3 billion in cuts that they can't explain—$3 billion that they've hidden, as if we're all too stupid to notice. That is the way this government operates. It tries to pull the wool over Australians' eyes. We cannot allow that to happen again. This government and its budget should be wholly rejected at the next election, which will be on 14 May or 21 May. We cannot afford another decade of a government unable to manage Australia's finances and economy.</span>

The Chinese government is this close to getting a deal that will let it set up a military base with one of our closest neighbours. We could have Chinese naval vessels floating around just outside our waters and Chinese military assets and equipment in our backyard.</span>

I'm calling on the Solomon Islands government not to sign onto a deal that will make our region less safe: you will not gain anything from running to China, I can assure you. You might make a quick buck, but it will come at the cost of your own sovereignty. It will come at the cost of that, I can assure you. Don't subject yourself to the wishes of a totalitarian government with an appalling track record on human rights.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the Australian government: you took your eyes off the road! You should be ashamed of yourselves! China is making moves in the Pacific; that is quite clear. What happened to your Pacific Step-up? What happened to it? You told us five years ago that you would protect us from this happening and here it is—it's happening! I can tell you now that you've failed and you've failed miserably.</span>

Once again we have a lack of planning and a lack of foresight, and now Australians are going to pay the price. I don't know if Labor will be any different; don't get me wrong. But we're the ones in the world who look like we've fallen asleep. This car is hurtling off the road, and I can tell you that we could be about to hit a tree. It's not just bad for us: we just signed on to AUKUS—how does it look for our UK and US allies that we can't even keep the Chinese military out of our own backyard?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  Thank you, beautiful black Acting Deputy President! A truly successful budget is measured by the good in people's lives. Budgets are choices to do things or not to do them. The Prime Minister has chosen not to support legal assistance services like the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service, the Community Legal Services Program, the Family Violence Prevention Legal Service program and the legal aid commissions. In fact, Mr Morrison announced a budget cut in real terms to Aboriginal legal services and Aboriginal family violence prevention and legal services. This is after he promised during the Closing the Gap process to do things differently. He's a liar! <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap</span> isn't worth the paper it's written on! This is how they treat our people. This is a budget for the billionaires and the big corporations, not the people who are struggling in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having access to legal help is critical to enforcing and protecting our rights. That's why the Morrison government chose not to support it. Legal assistance services are struggling to clear the COVID backlog and to make do with cuts to their budgets. This is why we need Greens in power. With the Greens in power, this is what you'll get: an age of legal responsibility of at least 14 years of age; independent policy and prison oversight; a charter of human and environmental rights; and a better family law system. And we would double funding for legal assistance services while also boosting their funding to cover the cuts by Mr Morrison.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens will build stronger and better-connected communities, not funnel people into the quicksand of the criminal legal system.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  At the commencement of this parliament, in response to representations I made to then Senator Cormann, the government undertook to introduce legislation that would improve protections for public-sector whistleblowers. As this parliament draws to a close, we find ourselves with yet another case of all announcement and no substance. The Assistant Minister to the Attorney-General, who is sitting opposite, made an announcement recently, saying that they would flick it to the next parliament. That sounds a little bit like an ICAC.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>These reforms are essential. Public sector workers need to have the courage to stand up and be able to call out inappropriate conduct, illegal conduct and maladministration. They can't do that when they don't have any protection. And it's even worse than that. Let's look at some of the people who have very bravely come forward. Richard Boyle, an Adelaide constituent, came forward and blew the whistle on the tax office's abuse of garnishee powers. Sadly, he is in court now dealing with the fallout from that because the ATO did not properly process his claim. We've got others: Witness K, who, sadly, has already been convicted; Bernard Collaery, a brave, brave person, honoured now by the Timor-Leste parliament; and David McBride, who revealed war crimes in Afghanistan. All of them are being persecuted for it. We cannot have this situation. It erodes our democracy when whistleblowers can't come forward and call out wrongdoing inside government. That just seems to be what the government wants. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  On so many levels and in so many ways, last night's budget was a missed opportunity to deliver for South Australians. But what is beyond comprehension to me is that this government, in this budget, failed to deliver a solution for the urgent healthcare needs in Ceduna at Yadu Health. I have stood in this chamber previously and talked about Yadu Health and the catastrophic situation we have in Ceduna. This Aboriginal controlled health clinic is in a state of catastrophic disrepair, with mould, painted-over asbestos, a roof falling in and unsealed windows. Parts of the building have been condemned, and staff members risk being electrocuted at their desks. It is that unsafe. It is that unfit for the people who work there and the people they serve. It is appalling. Yadu has been ignored. This community has been ignored. For far too long, too many people have walked through the doors of Yadu, seen how catastrophic the conditions are and just kept on walking. The government know the situation this clinic is in, and they could have used this budget to fix it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am deeply proud that Labor have committed that if we are in government we will spend $13.35 million to rebuild Yadu Health. It's time for the Liberals to match that commitment. Every single South Australian Liberal senator in this chamber should be standing up for Yadu, for the people of Ceduna and for the communities that this clinic serves. The member for Grey certainly should be doing everything he can to secure this commitment from the Liberals. The people of Ceduna deserve so much more. The remote Indigenous communities that this clinic services deserve so much more. If you are serious about closing the gap and about the healthcare needs of people in Ceduna, fix Yadu Health—rebuild it and match our commitment.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  In yesterday's election budget there was a recycled announcement for nearly a billion dollars in funding for the Great Barrier Reef, specifically $160 million of that for a reef adaptation fund to help the reef fight the challenges of climate change and invasive species, like the crown-of-thorns starfish. Sadly, in yesterday's budget there wasn't a cent for the Great Southern Reef—the Great Barrier Reef's southern sister—a reef system that stretches from New South Wales down to Victoria, around the coastline of my home state, Tasmania, through to South Australia and Western Australia. Over the last 20 years, the Great Southern Reef has received just $4.8 million in funding from the Commonwealth, less than one per cent of what the Great Barrier Reef just got from this budget. This reef system is arguably as significant as the Great Barrier Reef in terms of its biodiversity, its ecology and habitat, and its impact on local communities right around this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give a shout-out today to the legends down in my home state of Tasmania, who, on the smell of an oily rag, are trying to regrow Tasmania's giant kelp forest, this nation's first critically endangered habitat. In 2012 the giant kelp forests were declared in danger, and not a cent has come from the government to help regrow those forests. We have legends like Professor Craig Johnson at the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, Dr Ling, Dr Cayne Layton and, of course, Mick Baron at the Eaglehawk Dive Centre. I was lucky enough to go out with Mick Baron and Dr Scott Ling recently to look at the kelp forests and the work that they're doing to regrow them. They need funding. They need the federal government to step up. TARFish, the state's biggest recreational fishing group, has recommended that both Labor and the Liberals pledge the funding that's so desperately needed for the Great Southern Reef. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In the last few weeks I've been back up into the Hunter region. I met with the Singleton and Muswellbrook councils, and in previous visits to the area I've met with the Cessnock and Lake Macquarie councils. The one piece of feedback I continually get from that area is that it is poised for a bright, vivid and exciting future, and I am proud of our government for recognising and identifying the Hunter as a key hub for regional development in our budget last night. We have dedicated $750 million for projects in the Hunter region to establish it as a key regional development and energy security hub in New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hunter already has everything going for it: it has resources, farming, tourism, wineries and defence. And it's got me standing here happily representing it and very proudly advocating for its future. It has opportunities for economic diversification, and that is exactly what our regional hub investment is going to boost. The investment includes almost $270 million to build the New England Highway bypass of Muswellbrook to improve freight outcomes for the region. We're also investing $100 million to support further activities and early works to make the Port of Newcastle hydrogen-export ready. This complements the state and federal governments' commitment to make the Hunter a hydrogen hub into the future. We're also investing in the fast rail from Sydney to Newcastle, because the Hunter is our future.</span>

It sits in the electorate of Forrest and its local member is a Liberal, Ms Marino. The South West Aboriginal Medical Service has been after a health hub for at least the last six years—the whole of which time the Morrison government has been in power—which is a much shorter time than Ms Marino has been the member for Forrest, and they have spoken to Ms Marino. So imagine how disappointed they will be to see that there is not one single cent in the budget for the South West Aboriginal Medical Service—not one cent. SWAMS are currently paying $600,000 a year in rent, in funded money, because they have grown so much. There's been a 20 per cent increase in the use of their services over the last three years. But they have been ignored by all of those WA Liberal senators, they have been ignored by their local federal member and they have been ignored by the WA based Minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But they haven't been ignored by Labor. We have committed $18.3 million to SWAMS if we win government, which will help them establish their new health hub. They will be looking at the budget today and will see that they got not one cent from you on that side—not one cent, in one of your own safe seats. You have completely ignored the South West Aboriginal Medical Service. Shame on you. Let's hope that Labor wins, and we can commit to that health hub to promote a service that's brilliant, that's well renowned in the area and that's had a 20 per cent increase in customers through the door. You have completely ignored it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We have a premier who sends goons to raid the Integrity Commissioner's office. We've got a Labor government that is corrupt. If you look up White Pages, there is corruption there in Queensland. Do not let Albanese do to Australia what Palaszczuk has done to Queensland. Especially do not let those oxygen thieves at the far end of the chamber get anywhere near government.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">14:01</span>):  We will move to question time now. We are starting a minute-and-a-half late. I also note that I said yesterday that I'd come back to the Senate in relation to points of order taken by Senators Whish-Wilson and McKim in relation to matters raised in question time. I reiterate the point that I made at the time, which is that I considered the minister's answer to be directly relevant to the questions asked. I do not see it as my role as President to interpret a question as narrowly as the questioner might wish in circumstances in which the minister—and, in particular, a minister in a representative capacity—is talking directly about the government's intentions or actions in respect of the matter raised. This falls squarely within the principle that a president cannot direct a minister on how to answer questions.</span>

By speaking further about the scope and aims of the funding, the minister remained relevant to the question asked, even though senators may have preferred that the minister provide a different response.</span>

In particular, I note the reference to representative ministers. The Clerk has previously indicated—as I think Senator Ryan has—that if a minister representing is asked about the state of mind of another minister, then obviously that's not in their knowledge. But I would respectfully suggest that it would be a new threshold to suggest that somehow ministers representing have a different level of accountability to the chamber than do ministers in their own portfolio.</span>

The budget papers do set out the impacts of what we are seeing are global shocks and disruptions in relation to pressures on inflation in Australia and right around the world. The aftershocks of COVID-19, which are causing disruptions to global supply chains, and, most notably, the terrible, tragic war that Russia is inflicting upon Ukraine at present have had enormous implications for inflationary pressures right around the world. Those opposite may not want to acknowledge the fact that oil price spikes are a real inflationary factor, but they are a real inflationary factor.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>Senator Ayres spoke about the change in relation to inflation figures since the previous budget. Of course, since the previous budget we have seen huge spikes in oil prices, which have a very direct impact in relation to there being higher inflation. Our government is responding to the pressures that Australians face. We're responding in terms of providing a 22c a litre reduction in the fuel excise. We're lowering petrol prices for Australians while this spike is in place, while the world moves through these terrible difficulties caused by what's happening in Ukraine. We're providing additional support to low-, middle-, fixed-income Australians. Why are we able to do that? We're able to do it because our government has created a strong economy that has got more Australians in jobs, a strong economy that has provided a stronger budget position. That is enabling us to have lower deficits, lower debt, but also to provide additional support for Australians when they need it—additional support for Australian households, motorists, farmers and businesses—to ensure they get the help that they deserve. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The wage price index is forecast to grow to 3¼ per cent in the new financial year starting 1 July, following the provision of these additional supports that we're providing. It then grows further to 3½ per cent real wages growth put out into the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Ayres also asked about the dollar value for Australians in different circumstances. But when it comes to take-home pay for Australians there are many factors at play. And when it comes to take-home pay our income tax cuts play a very big factor. They play a very big factor. Someone earning around $90,000 under the Labor Party would have been paying $21,200 in income tax. But under the Liberal and National parties they are paying $18,600—a very significant addition to their take-home pay.</span>

We've demonstrated the ability to increase the ability of Australians to earn a wage by creating more jobs. Under our government 1.7 million more jobs have been created during our time in office. That's 1.7 million more Australians who have the opportunity to work, the opportunity to earn an income, the opportunity to support their families. And thanks to our income tax cuts they get to take more of that pay home as well.</span>

I've heard their calls to say they believe there should be an increase in wages for aged-care workers. But will they put a number on that? No. They don't have the guts. They won't put a number on it.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night our government handed down a budget that delivers a plan for a stronger future, that delivers a long-term economic plan to continue the growth in jobs and our economy, which is world leading, and that delivers record investments in essential services and necessary and essential investment in our defence and national security. It creates a stronger, more secure Australia. It's a budget that recognises the challenges we've come through from COVID-19 and those we now face in a more uncertain and contested world. It's a budget that recognises the pressures households are feeling right now, which is why we are taking the dividends of a stronger economy to reduce debt and to reduce deficits, compared with what was previously forecast. It's why we're also taking some of those dividends to help ease the pressures on Australian households—to ensure the 22c-per-litre cut in the petrol excise, which will save around 15 bucks every time an Australian goes to fill up their car and, of course, provides additional benefits to hardworking parents, who have to run around to work, to school and to sport. It provides additional benefits for those in regional Australia, who have further distances to drive and for whom the impacts are greater. It provides additional support to low-, middle- and fixed-income Australians by lifting the tax offset provisions by providing one-off payments to help people get through the temporary spikes that we are seeing in relation to the cost of living.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, it does much more in terms of our plans for the future. It helps first home owners, getting more first home buyers into the market. It provides additional support for the provision of housing across the board. This is a plan that shows we continue to support Australians in every aspect of their lives. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Labor themselves—I hear lots of interjections—held jobs up as being the big test for the government in terms of how we managed the crisis. That's what Mr Chalmers said and what nearly everybody else over there said. We have delivered in spades. Unemployment is headed to a 50-year low—at four per cent, headed to 3.75 per cent—creating opportunities to get young Australians into skilled, secure jobs. During the pandemic, we invested some $13 billion in skills and training. The results speak for themselves. A record 220,000 Australians are now in trade apprenticeships, the highest number since records began, and last night laid the foundations for even more young Australians to get an opportunity in an apprenticeship and in training. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Nearly eight million Australians are employed in small businesses. That's why our government delivered lower tax rates for small businesses—the lowest tax rates in 50 years for Australian small businesses—and this budget builds on that support, providing more tax incentives for small businesses to invest in skilling their workforce and more tax incentives for small business to invest in the digital technologies to uplift their productivity and their capabilities. </span>

We will see the first mRNA vaccine manufacturing facility in the Southern Hemisphere built in Australia. There's additional support for our universities, for CSIRO and for industry to ensure the rapid commercialisation of different products innovated in Australia, and an extension of our patent box tax reforms to make sure that innovations that happen in Australia can be commercialised in Australia and manufactured in Australia, creating more job opportunities for more Australians into the future. </span>

                  </a>  I'm happy, Senator Wong, to repeat it here: clearly there are failings on your side in the ability to read the budget paper. There is a reduction—Senator Watt's holding it up. Go and have a look at his screen. It says a reduction in decisions taken but not yet announced. Guess why, Mr President? Because we've announced them. There's your answer, Senator Gallagher: in important areas, like women's safety, we had made a provision in MYEFO for women's safety. We made the provision and now we've announced the spending on women's safety—a very important provision that we put in place in this budget. </span>

                  </span>We did the same in areas of apprenticeship reform. We made a provision in MYEFO and now we've announced the spending on apprenticeship reform. Do you know what this is, Mr President? It's careful, prudent budgeting. It's recognising there may be expenses that come forward in the future, and you put some away to meet those expenses. That, of course, is why our government is able to maintain a AAA credit rating. It's why our government is able to hand down budgets where the deficits are lower than expected. Those opposite, when in government, when they've announced budgets, have ordinarily had deficits far greater than what they had forecast. We've come through a pandemic and what we have done in every year since facing that pandemic, in budgets, budget updates and this budget, is reduce the size of the forecast deficits, thanks to our careful management. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Minister, in the MYEFO, you had $16 billion worth of decisions taken but not yet announced. In this budget, in the final forward estimates years, you have $3 billion worth of cuts to expenditure. Why won't you just be upfront and explain what those cuts are, or are you just trying to get through to the next election? </span>

Yes, we have taken decisions to reverse out of some decisions taken but not yet announced and to realise some of those decisions to announce them, to publish them in the budget papers to make them transparent. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite seem to think that government shouldn't put away for potentially foreseen expenditure. We think it's prudent to put away for that. It's a bit like what those opposite used to do on commodity prices. Does anybody remember when Mr Swan, who of course is the mentor of Mr Chalmers, the now shadow Treasurer, used to take high commodity prices and assume they'd continue into the future? It is little wonder his budgets blew out. We assume commodity prices will come down—another act of careful, cautious, conservative budgeting. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This budget represents the economic plan for the future for Australia—an economic plan that has delivered record jobs for Australians and an economic plan that has been built on lower taxes for Australians. Under the coalition, income taxes are lower than they were under the Labor Party. Under the coalition, taxes on Australian small businesses are lower than they were under the Labor Party. Under the coalition, taxes on Australian industry, energy and electricity are lower than they were under the Labor Party. Taxes on housing, retirees and investments are lower than they would have been under the Labor Party. Could we imagine the disaster that would have befallen Australia during COVID-19 if their $386 billion of higher taxes had been applied just at the time when the economy needed opportunities and room for business to grow? Thank God we won the last election.</span>

They have reduced 20 per cent, and we're very proud of that as a nation. There are a lot of countries that talk a big game with regard to lowering emissions but don't actually deliver, but on this side of the parliament we focus on delivery and outcomes, not platitudes. We're focused on delivering affordable, reliable energy to support the economy and new jobs, and Australia's competitive advantage has always been based on cheap energy and gas. It will be central to our ongoing economic recovery.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side, we understand that gas is a critical enabler of our economy and employs so many working-class Australians. For the past decade, the manufacturing sector has depended on gas as its largest source of energy. Gas makes up 42 per cent of manufacturing's total energy use, according to the latest Australian energy statistics. That is why our gas fired recovery is so critical. It is a cornerstone in strengthening Australia's sovereign capabilities. You only need to look at what's happening to gas prices in Europe to see the devastation that can occur in the economy: prices are rising more than 300 per cent. As a result of industry and government working together, we've been able to avoid these international price hikes, with our prices being around 78 per cent lower than prices in Europe, which were trading at over $47 per gigajoule in mid-March.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're taking action to boost the east coast gas market across the entire supply chain. Through the budget, we're backing seven priority projects, as well as key carbon capture and storage pipelines, with a $50.3 million investment. Our investment will get local gas where it's needed to help keep the lights on and homes heated in southern Australia. In our home state of Victoria, Senator Thorpe, it does get quite hold. Having homes heated during winter is important. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's not just for local jobs out in the regions and in the industrial sections of our capital cities so that working Australians can earn a good wage in high-paying, long-term careers. It is also important that we have a gas led recovery to ensure that individual Australians and working families can heat their homes at an affordable cost. </span>

This is an historic budget for the regions, one that reflects our government's and my party's paramount belief that this nation's future prosperity is inextricably linked to the health, wealth and opportunity that exist in our regions. The budget builds on the $100 billion investment that we as a government have made since 2013, in infrastructure, digital connectivity, health and education.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Treasurer stated last night, no government has invested more in our regions than this Liberal-Nationals coalition. Last night we announced an unprecedented $2 billion Regional Accelerator Program, which is open to regional centres across the country that have the ambition and plan to grow, seek to overcome challenges, and seize the new opportunities that this decade will see. It will take a place-based, locally driven, data-focused approach, enlisting the private sector to drive catalytic, transformative economic growth in areas such as manufacturing, education, supply chains, export opportunities and industry development. From Mount Gambier and Devonport to Mildura and Mackay, if these regional centres want to strengthen and grow their local economy and secure a stronger future, the $2 billion program will be available for this purpose. I look forward to prospective councils and regions coming forward with plans and projects that will create local jobs and build on their own unique local assets.</span>

It is intended that the Regionalisation Fund will provide for larger grants of, say, $10 million or more for transformational projects which will support long-term economic growth and job creation in the regions. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Examples of how the Regional Accelerator Program will unlock those transformative opportunities include two regionally focused rounds of our Modern Manufacturing Initiative, to the tune of half a billion dollars, so that regional centres right across the country that see their ambition as being an industrial heartland and centre will have the support to make that happen.</span>

Firstly, let me place on record all of our thoughts for those affected by recent natural disasters across Australia for the loss of life, the loss of property and the impacts that that has had upon so many Australians, in particular across parts of New South Wales and South-East Queensland—especially, most intensely, in the Northern Rivers parts of New South Wales. The losses being felt across many regions are real. They have a devastating impact on families and on businesses, and they require significant reconstruction efforts.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to those disasters, our government has provided extensive assistance and support to date. We have provided more than one million payments to families across New South Wales and Queensland in support of their immediate needs for assistance. We have provided the initial activation in relation to disaster assistance support across New South Wales and Queensland, and, contrary to the question that was asked and the assertion that there was not coverage in last night's budget, in fact last night's budget provided more than $6 billion of support for the natural disaster assistance response across New South Wales and Queensland.</span>

It has been 20 days since Mr Morrison announced that his government would provide flood victims in the electorate of Page with assistance payments of $3,000 each. Thousands of homes across South-East Queensland were also devastated, yet Mr Morrison has only provided Queensland flood victims with assistance payments of $1,000 each. Why does Mr Morrison think flood victims in New South Wales are worth more than three times as much as those in Queensland?</span>

Whilst all of these disasters are terrible tragedies for the communities involved, we had never before seen the intensity and severity of that flood disaster in New South Wales, as acknowledged, for example, by former Governor-General Peter Cosgrove and others. For those opposite to seemingly begrudge the additional assistance provided to those in the Northern Rivers district is really quite unbecoming, quite unfair and nothing but cheap politics.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Families and Social Services, Minister for Women's Safety and Manager of Government Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:42</span>):  I thank Senator Askew for her ongoing interest in what is a very important issue for every single Australian. In last night's budget we made an announcement—an historic $1.3 billion of new funding—to bring new investment to women's safety initiatives. This brings our commitment to the first action plan, under the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children in this country, to $2.5 billion. The development of the next national plan has been the culmination of many months of consultation with advocates, victims-survivors, service providers, researchers and other experts across the whole of Australia to make sure that we had the most input and engagement we could, because we know that for the next national plan to succeed we must listen, we must engage and we must get this right. That is why the plan has been informed, importantly, by contributions by people who have lived experience of family, domestic and sexual violence. We have managed to gather that information through fora, such as the 2021 National Summit on Women's Safety, as well as surveys, targeted consultations, interviews and public comments that we sought throughout the process. The voices and experiences of victims-survivors are absolutely essential, when we design the programs and when we deliver the programs, because we need to ensure that our programs are designed to be delivered in a trauma informed way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, our investment spans the entire life cycle of domestic violence. We need to deal with prevention, early intervention, response and recovery, because if we are to end gender based violence we must address all areas. The Women's Safety Package included $222.6 million towards prevention initiatives, including supporting Our Watch, and it included $328.2 million for early intervention as well as $480 million for response.</span>

Yesterday we announced an additional $240 million extension to the escaping violence payment, which provides women up to $5,000 to help them establish a life free from violence. This will support another 37,000 women who have made that incredibly brave decision to leave a violent relationship.</span>

We're also providing $54.6 million to support women and children staying in their own homes, when it's safe to do so, through planning, personal safety et cetera. This helps women and children to remain in their communities and schools without disruption, and it ensures that perpetrators are punished, and not the victims.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's incorrect to assert as she did in relation to climate expenditure. The government's investment in relation to achieving net zero, continuing to drive down emissions from the 20 per cent reduction that Australia has achieved to date and continuing to invest in areas of low-emissions technology is real. In this budget alone, building on top of our previous low-emissions strategies and commitments, there is new funding for microgrids in rural and regional communities, to take them off diesel power generation and to give them both cleaner and cheaper electricity for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this budget alone, there is of course the patent box reforms, which I have already referenced, to ensure that clean energy and low-emissions technologies developed in Australia are actually commercialised in Australia. This is to make sure that we seize the advantage. All of this is building on the fact that there is more money for hydrogen in this budget too, for ensuring that the hydrogen hubs our government is seeking to develop and invest in in that industry also support the development of demand for hydrogen, to ensure that all aspects of the supply chain for hydrogen are supported. So this is very strong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the claims which Senator Cox has made about subsidies: this is a common refrain from the Australian Greens. When you dig down, what they're actually talking about is the diesel fuel tax rebates. Those are the subsidies they're talking about. Essentially, they're tax rebates provided to businesses in Australia, to those in the resources sector and to Australian farmers as well. They're tax rebates in relation to their business expenses. That's not an uncommon thing and it's certainly not a subsidy in terms of their operations. These are some of the biggest taxpayers in Australia—some of the biggest contributors to our economy in terms of jobs and revenue—and from that, support for climate action, for example— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Of course, they're stage 3 because we've already delivered stage 1 and stage 2. Stage 1 and stage 2 prioritised low- and middle-income Australians first and foremost. I know that if we have a change of government—heaven forbid!—at the next election it won't matter whether you're a low-income Australian or a high-income Australian; you will end up paying higher taxes, which is evidenced from the fact that every one of Senator Cox's questions was about putting more tax on some of Australia's biggest income earners, more tax in relation to Australian property owners, more tax in relation to Australian workers. If the Greens have the ability to hold, as they will, the Labor Party—hold them to things in government—then the Australian Greens will be pushing for more taxes on Australian wages, more taxes on Australian housing and more taxes on Australian industry, and they will leave Australia far worse off.</span>

Yes, there is one measure that is particularly focusing on resource and energy hubs and providing investment in terms of infrastructure and spending in those resource and energy hubs, but there is also support in other ways for regional Australia. Two billion dollars of the regional acceleration program, which Senator McKenzie spoke of before, will help ensure that, whether it is across manufacturing or the skills agenda or exporters from regional South Australia, they will have a greater opportunity in relation to accessing those areas of regional funding.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the infrastructure spending, I've noticed commentary in non-South-Australian media, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> and elsewhere, suggesting that South Australia is receiving a disproportionate share of infrastructure spending. In fact, up to 17 per cent of new infrastructure commitments are going into South Australia. So you have to be careful when you start trying to pick and choose in those regards, because what we've seen, in relation to delivery of the North-South Corridor, investment in the South Eastern Freeway and support for the Horrocks Highway, is that in South Australia there is a surge in infrastructure spending and investment supporting SA. Of course, in terms of our government there is perhaps the most significant impact for South Australia, which is what we have done to turn around defence industry investment. Those opposite, when they were in government, commissioned zero vessels in terms of naval shipbuilding, versus, on this side, 70 vessels as part of a strategy supporting SA and WA.</span>

I just went through a number of the areas of investment for South Australia. In terms of generating further wealth for regional communities in South Australia, you need only look, for example, at one of our major manufacturing investments that we have announced and made. The new investment in plant protein will ensure that South Australian grain and legume producers have the opportunity not just to be exporters of their grains or legumes to the world but to benefit from value adding and to have a manufacturing industry that invests in higher-value products, generating more for our farmers and our regional communities. It's not just that investment in roads and other infrastructure; it is also that creation of new industries across SA which are making sure it will be stronger into the future.</span>

South Australians, like all Australians, are paying lower taxes thanks to our government. South Australian businesses, including small businesses, are paying lower taxes thanks to our government. South Australians, indeed, like others across the National Electricity Market, are paying lower electricity prices thanks to our government. Let's take that, for example. Electricity price averages, when the Labor Party was last in office, grew by 12.9 per cent, but under our government we've brought that back to 0.4 per cent throughout the life of our government, with, indeed, a reduction of eight per cent over the last two years. That means that, if you're in SA or elsewhere across the NEM, you get the opportunity, as a rural or regional person or anybody else, for more cost-effective living and business. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As always, I acknowledge Senator Small as one of those people who employ Australians. He runs a small business, Small's Bar, down in Bunbury in Western Australia. Senator Small, you're on the coalition side of politics, so you understand that small and family businesses are the backbone of the Australian community. They are the heart of our local communities. They employ nearly eight million Australians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently in Australia we have more people in work than ever before. We have more people in work now than we did before COVID-19, and, of course, a lot of that has to do with the growth of small business in this country. Look at how small businesses themselves have embraced the policies that the coalition government put in place throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Employment in small business has grown by around 10 per cent since the beginning of the pandemic. That just shows you how resilient small businesses are in Australia and—in particular in Bunbury, Western Australia, where Senator Small comes from—how resilient small businesses are in rural and regional Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did the government do last night? We backed small and family businesses even further. They were already benefiting from the lowest tax rate in 50 years and record investment incentives under the coalition government. That is in stark contrast to what those on the other side offer. Under those on the other side, they were paying a tax rate of 30 per cent. They are currently paying a tax rate of 25 per cent; that is the lowest tax rate in 50 years. Last night, we invested further. In particular, we have invested a $120 tax deduction that they will get by investing in upskilling their workforce. For every $100 a small business spends on training their employees, they will get a $120 tax deduction back. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Senator Small also understands how important it is for the government to invest in small businesses so that they can embrace the digital revolution. You saw again last night the coalition government further investing in the capacity and the growth of small business. From budget night, every $100 these small businesses spend on digital technologies like cloud computing—we know how important that is—e-invoicing, cybersecurity and web design will now see them get a $120 tax deduction. That is getting them where we need them to be: in the digital age. We are also focused on cutting as much red tape as we can for small business, because when you cut red tape small businesses prosper. They grow and they create more jobs for Australians.</span>

Why? It's because the closest most of them have ever come to a small business is to proudly close it down. That is unacceptable behaviour. When it comes to taxes, there's only one way that those on the other side go, and that is up. It is in their DNA. On this side, we know that the best thing you can do for small businesses is to lower their taxes. That is why, under the coalition government, they are paying the lowest tax rate in 50 years.

As a government, we've invested over half a billion dollars to implement substantial changes to the Department of Veterans' Affairs processes and their technology, making it both easier and faster for veterans and their families to access services and support. We've seen the number of claims received by DVA double—in fact more than double—over the last three financial years, and that of course requires additional resourcing to manage and that's exactly what the Australian government is doing. </span>

The additional funding and the average staffing level numbers received through this budget will be used to recruit additional APS staff, both ongoing and non-ongoing, across DVA. In the claims processing area this will take into account that absolute requirement to reduce the backlog to which Minister Gee has been so committed over two years, and it will ensure appropriate staff are available to maintain claims processing at a normal rate into the future as is required. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr President, today we honour Dr Moses Henry Cass, otherwise known to his loved ones and friends as Moss. He was the federal member for Maribyrnong from 1969 to 1983 and, of note, was Australia's first environment minister. Moss lived a long life dedicated to improving the world around him and preserving and protecting its natural environment. As a minister in the Whitlam government, Moss is remembered for his immense contributions to Australian public life and the selfless approach he took towards public service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moss Cass was born on 18 February 1927 in Narrogin, in my home state of Western Australia. He was the eldest of the three sons of Ben and Esther Cass. His father was a GP, and Moss and his brothers all pursued careers in medicine. Moss studied medicine at the University of Sydney and, in 1955, married Melbourne-born Shirley Shulman, who was instrumental in exposing him to a world of freethinkers and stirred his discussions on progressive causes. Through the 1950s and the 1960s, Moss worked as a registrar at hospitals in Sydney, in London and in Melbourne. It was in London that Moss undertook work at Guy's Hospital developing open-heart surgery techniques. Importantly, we acknowledge his work as a research fellow at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital, where he conducted research into the use of a heart-lung machine for open-heart surgery. Moss actually built the first heart-lung machine in Australia. Moss brought his expertise in medicine to the Labor Party's state and federal health policy committees and, from 1964 to 1969, served as the director of the Trade Union Clinic and Research Center.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A man of profound intellect, Moss thought deeply about the issues. He took to advancing a number of progressive causes, traversing health, media and environmental policy. Upon his election to parliament as the member for Maribyrnong in 1969, Moss advocated for the decriminalisation of homosexuality and marijuana and the legalisation of abortion. Moss was, as you would expect, entwined with health policy during his tenure in the parliament. It was following the election of the Whitlam government in 1972 that Moss was appointed as Australia's first Minister for the Environment and Conservation. He made this role his own and was instrumental in proposing and securing the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, mandating the use of environmental impact statements for federal government decisions. He initiated the influential public inquiries that preceded the end of sand mining on Fraser Island, the curtailing of the Ranger Uranium Mine in Kakadu and government protection of the Great Barrier Reef. Moss also enabled new grassroots environmental organisations through the doubling of federal government grants to these groups. He later became Minister for the Media in the Whitlam government. His work in issuing experimental radio licences is widely regarded as leading to the thriving community radio sector we have today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During his time in this parliament, Moss was known as an effective politician with a reputation for listening and a desire to relentlessly pursue reform where he felt it was necessary. Following his departure from the parliament, Moss maintained a keen interest in the Labor Party and in all those who were agents for change, from party branch members to environmentalists. Moss was a serious thought leader and a man who had vision of the type of Australia he sought to shape, and he pursued that vision untiringly. Today, let us all be inspired by the contributions Dr Moss Cass made to public life and by his reformist approach towards the significant challenges of his time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the Australian government and the Australian Senate, I extend our sincerest condolences to Moss's wife, Shirley, and the loved ones he leaves behind.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WONG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  I rise on behalf of the opposition and on behalf of the Labor Party to express our condolences following the passing, at the age of 95, of one of our own: the Hon. Dr Moses Henry Cass, known as Moss Cass, former member of the House and minister in the Whitlam government. I start by conveying the opposition's and the Australian Labor Party's deepest condolences to his family and friends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Moss Cass was the member for Maribyrnong in Melbourne from 1969 to1983 and was a minister in the Whitlam government from 1972 to 1975, serving in the environment and media portfolios. Along with Doug McClelland, Bill Hayden and Paul Keating, he was the last surviving of the Whitlam government ministers. Dr Cass deserves to be remembered as one of the great figures of our movement. His influence at a time of great change was profound. He not only led policy development as a minister but also advanced the case for reform on significant issues of social concern, including multiculturalism; education; state aid; reform of social policy, including on drugs, abortion and homosexuality; media reform; health reform; asylum seekers; and many more. Moss Cass's contribution wasn't only to the federal parliamentary Labor Party but to our broader cause, particularly through his work as a doctor and with the trade union movement. His commitment to the cause of Labor was absolute and stayed with him all of his life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I begin this speech, I reflect on my own personal engagement with Dr Cass, because I was the beneficiary of some extensive correspondence from him. He wrote to me over the last couple of years principally to provide his thoughts on media policy, and my office replied on my behalf and engaged in quite a lot of email correspondence. He also referred me to the book <span style="font-style:italic;">Moss Cass and the Greening of the Australian Labor Party</span>, which is available from the Parliamentary Library. This extensively covers Dr Cass's career, from his roles as environment minister and media minister to the many other causes he championed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very clear from the book and from other reporting that Moss Cass was well ahead of his time. He was ahead of his time on environmental protection and he was ahead of his time on medical and social reform, and many of the issues that Dr Cass grappled with remain significant matters of debate in Australian politics today. One of those is the media. Dr Cass expressed to me his concerns regarding the health of the Australian democracy, given what he regarded as biased media coverage, distortion of facts and the impact of free speech as a licence for hate speech. We didn't have any discussions, because he told me that, at the age of 94, he was too deaf to follow a telephone conversation and—because he was too unstable on his feet and nursing a couple of cancers—he couldn't travel far from home. But he was happy to correspond in writing, and what was clear from the written exchange was just how active his mind remained and just how passionate he remained about political causes and the cause of the Australian Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moss Cass was born in Western Australia, the son of Jewish Russian migrants, on 18 February 1927. His father was a doctor, and this was the career that he and his three brothers would pursue. He first pursued great innovation before turning his talents to delivering quality and holistic health care to working people and to developing health policy. After marrying his wife, Shirley, a Melburnian, in 1955, they moved to London, where his work developing open-heart surgery techniques equipped him with sufficient skills so that, when he returned to Australia, as my colleague Senator Cash has said, he was able to build Australia's first heart-lung machine. He was quite an extraordinary person.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He then was recruited to helm a new community healthcare centre in the western suburbs of Melbourne, in Footscray. The Trade Union Clinic and Research Center was established by the meatworkers union to deliver free treatment and promote preventative health care to workers. It was well ahead of its time, and Dr Cass's work there provides a window for his focus on broader issues of social inequality. Meatworkers obviously had a direct interest in the delivery of health care. Their occupation came with a multitude of perils—sharp knives and blades, heavy lifting, variable extremes of temperatures and risk of disease. The clinic became an overwhelming success, although it wasn't established and operated without resistance, particularly from insurers contesting workers compensation claims. A key component of its work was also research to 'treat, investigate and eradicate'. By undertaking proper investigation and diagnosis and deploying a range of treatments, the clinic was able to see many more workers return to work and to health sooner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Involvement with the health policy committee of the ALP went hand in glove with Dr Cass's expertise. When it came to health policy, this was a formative time in Australian public policy. The Whitlam government first took Medibank, the forerunner of Medicare, to an election in 1969, and, whilst Dr Cass had differing views about how these objectives might be achieved, he was a central voice in the debates that led to its development and implementation. He was part of a generation of parliamentarians who delivered one of the most substantial social policy reforms in Australian history. When the Fraser government worked to dismantle Medibank after 1975, as opposition health spokesperson he became a key defender.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Involvement in the trade union clinic had another benefit: it connected Moss Cass with the left wing of the Victorian trade union movement and the ALP. In addition to the already-mentioned involvement in its health policy forum, he held a seat on the Victorian state executive at a turbulent time in the Victorian branch—there seem to be quite a few of those—which sought to recover from the split which had probably its greatest impact there. He obtained support for preselection in the seat of Maribyrnong and won election in 1969.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at his first speech, it's really quite unusual not only for the times but also for a man. He devoted most of his first speech to the subject of abortion law reform. His experience as a doctor, but also his sense of justice, informed his position. He consistently sought reform, including by moving legislation in conjunction with other like-minded members across the parliament. Before the time suited it, he was also amongst those who advanced what was then described as homosexual law reform, working in conjunction with former Liberal Prime Minister John Gorton, Don Chipp and Andrew Peacock.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, he was also a minister in the Whitlam government. He was Australia's first Minister for Environment and Conservation, and he was instrumental in proposing and securing the Environmental Protection (Impact Of Proposals) Act 1974. This laid the groundwork for the ending of sand mining on Fraser Island and for protection of the Great Barrier Reef. As Minister for the Media, subsequently he engaged with causes that he would continue to advance in his postparliamentary life, particularly the power of media proprietors, and he was instrumental in the establishment of community broadcasting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My last correspondence with Moss Cass was in September last year. I wrote to thank him for his correspondence to me, for his continuing engagement in politics and public policy and for furnishing ideas for how he saw our nation's advancement—his ideas about how we could work towards a better future. I told him that, whilst I knew of him by virtue of the correspondence he engaged in with me, I had learnt a great deal more about his intellectual contribution to our party. I noted then, as I do now, that many of the causes that he had been championing more than half a century ago were still battles being fought and finally won by progressives at the current time—noting, for example, that my home state of South Australia had only recently fully decriminalised abortion. I expressed my hope that my card would find him in good health, but, alas, we now know he was only to be with us for a few more months. Sadly, he and his wife both required an increased level of care and had to move out of their home in Carlton, and I regret I wasn't able to take up his offer to visit him in Melbourne. But I am eternally grateful that I had the opportunity to personally express to him my gratitude.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moss Cass was a giant of the Labor movement, and he has done so much to benefit so many people and, more importantly, to benefit the nation. Moss Cass set a standard and leaves a legacy that few can profess to have emulated. I close by again expressing the opposition's condolences following his passing and conveying our deepest sympathies to his family and his friends.</span>

I never had the pleasure of meeting Moss Cass, but a great number of my fellow Greens did, and they have relayed to me nothing but admiration for a remarkable man.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moss was a great many things: a doctor, a medical scientist, a parliamentarian, a photographer, a father and a pioneer. He was also a voice for those who needed a voice and a voice for the things that didn't have a voice. In each of his endeavours throughout his long life, he was always collaborating with others, looking to create a better humanity and a world where people are at peace with each other and in connection with nature.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before entering parliament, Moss was a medical scientist. He built Australia's first heart-lung machine. While working as a registrar in London, he helped develop open-heart surgery. He used his experience as a doctor from the very start of his parliamentary career. His maiden speech is extraordinary. Instead of the usual story of self or grand pronouncements about the state of the world, he got straight to business. The entire speech was devoted to advocating for the legalisation of abortion. This included his own admission of criminality for having helped women terminate their pregnancies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If Moss is perhaps less well known than other parliamentarians who achieved lesser feats than he, then the telling is right there in his first speech, because it was not about him. It was about getting things done. And get things done he did. While serving as Australia's first Minister for the Environment and Conservation, he established Kakadu National Park. He established the National Parks and Wildlife Service and established the process for environmental impact statements, which saved Fraser Island from sand mining and restrained uranium mining in Kakadu.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Later, as Minister for the Media, Moss proposed the establishment of a national press council. In scenes that would not be unfamiliar today, Rupert Murdoch turned the full force of his media empire onto Moss and, in fact, onto the entire Whitlam government. But Moss stood his ground, and, although the Whitlam government did not survive, Moss's cause did, and in 1976 the Australian Press Council was established.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moss continued to work on progressive causes after his time in parliament, particularly those which sought to build alliances. He did so in a way that always sought to foster the next generation. He didn't seek to big-note himself or use his undoubted status to wield influence amongst fellow activists. He was humble and he was generous, and he was always about the collective and always about the many, many causes he was a champion of.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Someone who did know Moss well was Dr Bob Brown, former senator and former Leader of the Australian Greens. I spoke to Bob earlier today, and he asked me to place this on the record with regard to Moss Cass: 'Moss, along with Tom Uren, worked hard to try to save Lake Pedder after the Whitlam government was elected in 1972. Later on, Moss was made Minister for the Environment, and Prime Minister Gough Whitlam offered $8 million to Tasmanian Labor Premier Eric Reece for a moratorium on flooding Lake Pedder. But Reece, to the cheers of the Tasmanian House of Assembly, said he'd have none of it. Lake Pedder is still there, 50 metres under water, awaiting restoration. Moss was a very intelligent gentleman, who was to the left of the ALP in wanting social justice and environmental protection. He worked tirelessly to get the World Heritage Convention signed by Australia, which became crucial to saving the Franklin River. I remember Moss very fondly indeed.' Those are the words of former Senator Bob Brown.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moss's son, Dan, who has been a Greens staffer in the past, wrote of his dad recently that he made it into cabinet because of his science of hope, that radical honesty wins votes and that power only matters if you do something bold. What great and principled legacies those are to leave to the rest of humanity. To Dan, to Moss's wife, Shirley, and to his daughter, Naomi, I convey the deepest condolences from the Australian Greens. Vale, Moss Cass.</span>

                  <a href="282728" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McMAHON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:35</span>):  I rise today to take this opportunity to thank the Senate and to express my gratitude in a number of areas over the last three years of my time in this place. As we all know, in June last year the Country Liberal Party exercised their democratic right and selected a new Senate candidate. There have been many hours and column centimetres to discuss the merits of this decision—or otherwise. But I would like to have a few other reflections.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In reflecting on my time in this place, I want to start by acknowledging those around me who have offered me tremendous support over an extended period of time. I made some initial mistakes in who I chose to receive advice from. I have acknowledged those mistakes, and they continue to follow me in this place. Personal staff, as we know, can make or break an elected member, and I've certainly experienced both.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've taken the opportunity to bring my current staff to Canberra to witness the budget and see firsthand the parliament in action, which, unfortunately, they have been unable to do over most of my term. Let me start with some of the staff that I brought with me. Helen Bateman has been with the office from the onset and, more than most, has experienced the high and lows with me. Helen has seven decades of life experience, many of those in politics, and I am grateful for her tireless work in keeping me on schedule and for her genuine and sincere engagement with constituents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kylie Bonanni joined my office last year. Kylie swept into the office and brought with her substantial organisation skills, with her ability to connect to people and create from scratch programs and events for ministers and even the Prime Minister at short notice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge Lance Northey, who's not actually here today. He has been my long-suffering media adviser, and, given some of the media attention I have attracted, his has not been an easy task. He has filled the shoes with all of his many years of experience, as you would expect. To you, Hollie: I would thank you for bringing Lance to me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Marianne St Clair was a personal friend before I entered politics. She gives me endless joy and laughter, mainly at her own expense, but she doesn't mind; she's a good sport. Marianne, thank you for working tirelessly for our constituents and being a thorn in the side of Telstra and the NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Riley Schipp is a young Territorian who is studying here at ANU. Throughout COVID, he has unfortunately been quite estranged from us, but he contributes to our WhatsApp conversations and is outstanding at making mango daiquiris, a very important skill in a Territory office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kris Civitarese—Big Kris—joined my office after helping me fire a previous office manager. It's been a gift that keeps on giving. Sorry, Kris. You're like a boomerang: you keep coming back to us. Sometimes you don't know what you've been missing until you find it. Kris became a confidant of mine, and he steadied the office through the use of his own measured temperament and people skills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will mention Ashley Manicaros, who took over from Kris when Kris thought that he wanted to return to his home and wife in Tennant Creek. It turns out he was wrong; he came back to Darwin. Ashley was familiar to many in this place through a long career in politics. It seems some of you never appear to leave. He came back to Darwin, but, as he was familiar to many in this place through a long career in politics, it seemed some of you never appeared to leave. He left my office a few weeks ago to pursue other challenges, which I didn't understand, because I thought I was a pretty good challenge! But perhaps he meant he wanted less, not more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Wayne Nayda, my husband, who has been the reason I have been able to come to this place over the past three years without a tribe of, as Michaelia said this week, fur babies trailing behind me. It's often been expressed that we may like a Senate cattle dog, and I can assure you that you would have had several if I had not been able to leave them at home. He has also been incredibly supportive of me and my job, particularly over the last 12 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To all of my colleagues: I have and will forever appreciate your candour, your counsel and your friendship. And of course, particularly, my Nats Senate family: Matt, who is unfortunately not here; Susie; Perin; and our leader, Bridget. To all of you who have assisted my office by answering endless questions, taking time out of your busy days—and thank you very much to Holly, Keith Pitt and Bridget particularly for generously lending me your staff. I really, really appreciate the loaners. I'll just mention Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce and Vikki Campion, who have been absolute rocks to me during my time here. For those of you who know Barnaby well, he is a very kind and caring person. As a result of that kindness and caring attitude, he often tends to pick up stray people, and I kind of feel like I'm one of his strays that he just never managed to rehome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the opposition side, I wish to personally acknowledge Senator Don Farrell, who, despite his personal opposition to voluntary assisted dying, was prepared to offer his assistance in getting my Ensuring Northern Territory Rights Bill debated. His interactions with me were sincere, and his word was his word. I also want to say thank you for the kind words and often random calls and text messages from Senator Malarndirri McCarthy. She's obviously a Territory colleague and she has been a great friend and support. People think that, in the heat of political battle, we never work together, but of course those of us in this place know that that is not true. One of our greatest abilities in this place is the ability to work with each other. And of course when we work together the biggest winners, from our point of view, are Territorians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to mention—and I mentioned her in the condolence motion on Monday—Senator Kimberley Kitching. I spoke of my work with her and the joy that I had in sharing the joint standing committee with her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge all of my colleagues. Sorry if I've left some out; you're all special and important to me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been much written about my resignation from my former party, the CLP, and speculation over why. My losing preselection was not connected to my resignation at all. A democratic decision was made. We can argue the merits of that another time, but it was a democratic decision, and they exercised their right to do that. I have no problem with that decision at all. My reason to resign was driven entirely by my former staff member, Jason Riley—who did abuse and terrorise my office, including myself—and the party's decision to place him into a position on their central council. To have to sit in meetings with such a person was a very stressful experience and one that has not been without me seeking out professional assistance to overcome the anxiety and PTSD it created.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reported treatment of my fellow senator Kimberley Kitching—as I've just touched on Kimberley—by her Labor colleagues greatly saddens me. Whether or not it contributed to her death is a matter of speculation and it will likely never be determined, but that's really irrelevant. If it happened, it should not have happened, and yet it seems that it may have—and so it does over and over again, unfortunately. We need to accept that poor behaviour can be part of our profession, and that part needs to be eliminated from our game. A great friend of mine once said, 'Politics is a nefarious business,' and he was right. My only hope is that we are learning and evolving, and that it won't always have to be this way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This alleged behaviour towards Senator Kitching should not become a partisan football, for it is not constrained to any one particular side of politics. We on this side might laud ourselves over the recent response to claims of bullying and sexual harassment with the Jenkins report. And it was a very appropriate and good response. We will now find ourselves tempted to point to the other side with an attitude of, 'Look over there; see what they did.' We should refrain, for bullying, harassment and victim-blaming can still be occurring on all sides of politics. Just a few weeks ago I was the subject of a vicious display of victim-blaming in the media by a former senior staffer. This was in response to my revelation that I had resigned from the CLP due to inaction on my concerns for my personal safety. This public attack was female on female, as are the allegations surrounding Senator Kitching. It seems it's not a man thing, a faction thing or a party thing, but it certainly can be a political thing. I don't want this to become a finger-pointing or pointscoring exercise; I want it to be a learning one. I think of the premature death of my colleague Kimberley Kitching and one thing that haunts me is that it so easily could have been me. We can honour her memory by not making this a political issue but by fixing it so that politics is a better place, particularly for women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would now ask your indulgence to go over a few of the things that have been important to me during my time here. When I entered this place there was no COVID; the world seemed normal, and then the world came crashing down for the rest of my term. But I got stuck in and I wanted to achieve things. I didn't realise how short a time I would have in this place, so it is lucky that I got stuck in and tried to make Australia, particularly the Territory, a better place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this election, voters will get to elect two members for the Northern Territory in the House of Representatives. It is through the combined efforts of myself, working with my colleagues, and members opposite that we saved these two seats. I want to acknowledge the role of then Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormick, Barnaby Joyce, Llew O'Brien and Mathias Cormann, with Bridget McKenzie, in this as well. Had we failed then we would be electing one person less to argue our case in Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the agriculture space, we saw a modification and positive changes to ACIL 3.0 regulations. For that I thank my Nationals colleagues and Minister Littleproud for his open-minded approach as to the consequences for producers after they were abandoned by even the live exporters themselves. I am grateful that I had the support of my colleagues in the Nationals Senate team to convince the government not to appeal the live export decision of the Federal Court. We could easily have extended the pain, but common sense prevailed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction and development of an agricultural visa, which now has Vietnam signed up to the bilateral agreement, will assist the industry to address workforce shortages, as we did with the seasonal worker and other programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mangoes are the second largest value agricultural industry in the Northern Territory, and COVID nearly wiped this out with a lack of access to pickers. I think Minister Littleproud thought that I was haunting and stalking him, because every time in the months leading up to a mango picking season there would be many phone calls. In the end, we managed to save about 80 per cent of the mango crop. And now with this ag visa I am positive for the industry going forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also able to argue for the removal of the working hours cap for international students, which has eased the pressure when it comes to their ability to earn income on the back of COVID and provided the hospitality and tourism industries with another source of valued workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are still policy battles to be had, starting with the NT's ability to make its own laws. The Andrews bill is almost a quarter of a century old and it needs to be removed. Every other state in Australia is allowed to at least debate voluntary assisted dying laws and yet we in the NT and the ACT are not. We are not second-class citizens, so I ask that we not be treated this way. To quote a member opposite, 'We don't need voluntary assisted decision-making.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other fight at the moment in the Northern Territory—I know it happens as well in other jurisdictions—is that we are being mandated with COVID vaccinations. I'm not an antivaxxer. I'm a pro-vaxxer. I'm a scientist. I'm a vet. I'm fully vaccinated. I support vaccination. I support COVID vaccination. But that's my choice. I don't want to have to have it brought upon people that in order to work you have to undergo a medical procedure. There are also the powers that have been given to our Chief Health Officer, specifically in the Northern Territory. We should never shirk our responsibilities in parliament, but we are a democracy and we have seen the removal of rights, which makes me personally uncomfortable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving forward, I also have concerns about the support for business and industry in the term ahead. Labor and their green partners are anti energy, anti industry and anti agriculture. A Labor-Greens government is not what Australia needs right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also have grave concerns for the ability of the NT government to expend the Commonwealth funds that we've committed in areas, particularly roads and infrastructure. We've delivered a very generous budget. The problem is the NT government's inability to roll that money out and spend it where it's needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people have asked about the future for me—what I'm passionate about and what I'm working on. I'll go to my maiden speech where I talked about nuclear energy and how we cannot continue to ignore it as part of our energy mix and our broader solution to reaching net zero emissions. My position is similar to if not stronger than when I came to this place. The UK, the US, Canada and France all have around a 20 per cent nuclear mix in their energy plants and in their plans to achieve net zero. We can't be blind to this. We must explore every means available to mankind to address climate change concerns.

Nigel Scullion left very, very big shoes to fill, but you brought a very typical Territory attitude, guts and bravery to the role. You called a spade a spade. You called things as you saw it.

We sit on opposite sides, and I think that's a really good thing. There's probably not too much we agree on, but when we come together we know that there are issues that are so critical for the people of the Northern Territory, and you mentioned those in your speech. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly saving the seat of Lingiari—ensuring that the people of the Northern Territory retained two representatives in the House of Representatives—was absolutely critical, Sam. It was wonderful to be able to work with you on that. I certainly witnessed firsthand the enormous pressures you experienced on your side. I commend you for your ability to walk through that kind of fire, knowing you're doing so on behalf of the people we both represent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I reflect on having first met you when coming to politics and out on the hustings across the Territory. They say the Territory is a small place, but it's funny that we never got to meet each other until we were on the campaign trail. Then we started following each other to the different polling booths around the communities. I have to say that people then were asking, 'Who is this Dr Sam McMahon?' Sam, you leave the Senate obviously way too soon in my view, but you can leave the Senate knowing that in the three years that you have been here—with COVID for two of them, and that has been incredibly challenging—you have achieved enormously on behalf of the people of the Northern Territory, with the vote of keeping Lingiari and also with the voter ID concerns that we obviously had about the short time frame that people across the Northern Territory would have had to understand that bill. Your private senator's bill must be debated here in the Senate. I hope that those coming behind you will support that and push it through. I have no doubt that you will continue to support that from the outside. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me personally, it has been incredibly important to be able to work with you—agree on things and disagree on things. I always found that when we came together in an environment of respect, even if we didn't quite understand each other's values, you did respect the fact that we were there representing the people of the Northern Territory. That has been an important journey for me as well. So all the best, mate. I'll certainly see you out and about across the Territory. Thank you for your work on behalf of the people of the Northern Territory.</span>

What an impact you've made in those three years that you have been here, Sam. As Senator Bridget McKenzie said, you came here to fill big shoes. Nigel Scullion had been here for 17 years. He had sort of established the crazy Territory tradition here, and mango daiquiris became famous. Everyone thought, 'No way the next senator from the Northern Territory could ever possibly go anywhere near touching the sides of what Nigel did.' I have to say, Sam, you've done the Territory proud. I think your reputation as you leave here will be equally as colourful and interesting as that of Nigel. You've made a huge amount of friends since you've been here. I think we all count ourselves as your friend, and we know that when we get to the Territory we'll all be staying at your place!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I have to say is that, Sam, you have always maintained an extraordinary sense of humour. I was considering your first speech. You said, when describing your beautiful home, the Territory:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">To many Australians, the NT is an enigma. They know it exists. It has a rock, a park, and a city named after some guy who discovered swimming iguanas …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not sure that's the way I would necessarily describe Darwin, but I think that just epitomises the way you take life—you don't take yourself seriously but you take what you do really seriously. I think those sorts of comments show that. The rest of your maiden speech went on to explain how you had an extraordinary knowledge of the history and culture and what the Territory means to you. Even though it wasn't where you were born, from listening to your contributions over the last three years I know that the Territory is your heart. You came here to represent the Territory, and that's exactly what you did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, mate, it has been a huge privilege to have spent three years in this place with you. We've had many colourful evenings and many colourful days. I'm going to miss you a lot. I'll miss your honesty, your directness and your passion. But the one thing I am super looking forward to is the next chapter of the life that is Sam McMahon, because I'm sure it will be equally interesting because that is the person that you are. So go with all of our love and all the best for whatever comes next, Sam McMahon.</span>

I've had the privilege, in the three years that you've been here, to chair both the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee, which you were a member on, and the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, where, as other people have said, you showed a great interest in defence but also took on the responsibility of chairing the PFAS subcommittee and working with communities around Australia. Whilst I won't echo all the other comments about how you've approached the task more broadly in the Senate, in those two particular areas can I just say thank you for bringing your scientific mind and your commitment to evidence based policy to the various inquiries and reports that we did through the environment and communications committee, particularly in the environment area, where there's a lot of passion and a lot of people feel strongly about things but often the arguments aren't based on fact. Your ability to dig into the science and to bring forward fact was really prescient, and I really appreciate that contribution you've made as well as the contribution you've made to the whole area of foreign affairs, defence, trade and the PFAS subcommittee. Thank you, Sam.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  I rise on behalf of the Australian Labor Party in opposition to acknowledge and thank Senator McMahon for her service to the people of the Northern Territory, to the Senate and, therefore, to the nation. I will just make some brief remarks about this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to recognise the approach that Senator McMahon has taken to representing the Northern Territory here in this chamber. I want to publicly thank her for the principled stand she took in relation to the voter ID laws that were proposed and eventually abandoned by the government. In doing so, she did stand up for the interests of her community at some personal cost. I recall an interview with NITV outside Parliament House, where she said she'd raised some concerns about the bill with her colleagues and expressed concerns about how the laws would impact particularly on Indigenous Territorians. We thought her stance was the right one, but we recognise it wasn't necessarily popular on her own side. By making public those concerns, she did influence the course of that legislation, which obviously did not proceed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator McMahon has also been, as Senator McCarthy said, very principled in her support for a minimum of two seats for the Northern Territory, and that is an important achievement for her. As she indicated, she's a strong advocate for Territory rights, and I agree with her views about the Andrews bill. I wish her well for this next stage in her life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If there's nothing further on Senator McMahon from the government, I will proceed to Senator Carr. Senator Carr is unable to be here today. Depending on what happens in the election and what happens with the parliamentary sittings, obviously, if we sit before 30 June, I would anticipate that Senator Carr will come back to the Senate and participate in what I'm sure will be a very memorable valedictory. But, in the event that the Senate does not sit again prior to 30 June, I didn't want this time to pass without the opportunity to make some remarks about Senator Carr.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the Labor Party—the opposition—and my Senate colleagues, I want to thank our Labor comrade Senator the Hon. Kim Carr for his service and contribution over what is one of the most significant terms served by a senator in this parliament. Senator Carr first entered the Senate in 1993, filling the casual vacancy caused by the resignation of John Button, a Labor giant. It was fitting that Senator Carr replaced Australia's pre-eminent industry minister. In his time here, he has been a champion for Australian industry—most notably as Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research in the Rudd and Gillard governments, where he and I served as members of the cabinet together. He also held additional portfolios during this time, including in manufacturing, defence materiel and human services. The higher education, science, research and manufacturing communities could not have had a more passionate champion and advocate around the cabinet table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent years, he has been an invaluable contributor to the Labor opposition under both Bill Shorten and Anthony Albanese. His role on the legal and constitutional affairs committee has guided scrutiny of an abundance of legislation, particularly in the area of migration. Previously, in his position on the Senate economics committee, he was the spearhead for the opposition's critique of failures in the government's management of Australia's defence shipbuilding program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Deputy Chair of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation he has worked diligently in combination with the chair of the committee, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, to ensure the highest level of scrutiny was applied to the making of government regulations. Together these two senators, Senator Carr and Senator Fierravanti-Wells, have energised the work of this 90-year-old committee to ensure its continuing relevance and importance for many years to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge and honour the role that Senator Carr has played as a contributor to Labor's Senate team. I want to acknowledge and honour his nearly three decades of service to the people of Victoria and the nation. And I want to honour and acknowledge his passionate advocacy for the Labor cause and, in particular, for those issues about which he cares so passionately.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WALSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  I too rise to share some reflections on Senator Comrade Kim Carr, in the event that election timing prevents a more fulsome contribution later. I note that Kim has been an absolute giant of the Victorian Labor Party, and I know that, as Kim moves to a life beyond his parliamentary work, he will absolutely continue to be a Labor stalwart, a champion of the mighty Victorian union movement, and a warrior for Australian manufacturing and the opportunities it can bring working people. Anyone in the Victorian Labor Party who has witnessed Kim Carr at a Labor Party conference has seen in action a man and a machine like no other. Always sporting his iconic three-piece suit, Kim Carr could always prosecute an argument on the conference floor and in the Socialist Left caucus—and I can tell you, Mr President, he didn't lose too many! From the moment Senator Carr set foot in this place, he was driven by a commitment to standing up for working people. That was fundamentally why Kim was here, and over the decades he has passionately defended the Australian union movement and maintained incredibly close and strong ties with Victorian unions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Wong noted, being the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research in the Rudd-Gillard government has undoubtedly been the highlight of Kim's absolutely extraordinary career. Kim championed the links between research, innovation and advanced manufacturing like no other. It was his vision that brought together the innovation and industry portfolios. As a minister, he was able to put that understanding into practice, defending jobs in the Australian car industry and fighting absolutely tooth and nail to keep those jobs and those skills here in Australia. This really was the portfolio that Kim was made for. As a minister, he read widely; he was voracious. He consulted widely, and everywhere that I go in Victoria today, to meet with industry, to meet with higher education or to meet with unions, Kim is consistently recognised in those conversations as an absolute powerhouse of this portfolio.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="&#xA;    font-size:11pt;&#xA;  ">
                  </span>On a personal note, I want to acknowledge Kim's wife, Carole, who has always been at Kim's side and who is just as passionate about the Australian Labor Party and the union movement as Kim is. I am sure Carole, the kids and the grandchildren will like having Kim at home a little bit more. As a fellow avid gardener, I know his garden will like having Kim at home a little bit more too. But, of course—as I think we all in this place know—if anyone knows Kim they will know that, while he's retiring from the parliament, he will not be retiring from the mighty Australian labour movement. I look forward to many, many more years of Kim's passion for our party, our unions and our people.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  Senator Scarr is rising to pay tribute to someone who I consider to be a good friend: Senator Carr. Can I just say how much Senator Carr's contribution on the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation Committee, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee has had an enduring positive impact on me. If someone had said to me before I came to this place that one of the senators I would speak the most fondly of and have a lot in common with, in terms of respect for institutions and the importance of those institutions in this place, was going to be Senator Kim Carr, I would have been surprised. But perhaps I would have been naive. I would just like to pay tribute to Senator Carr's intellectual rigour, his sense of humour and his generosity of spirit in terms of sharing lessons—hard-learned lessons, no doubt, over his years of contributions in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I pay my regards to Senator Carr. One of the best speeches I have heard in this place over the last three years was Senator Carr paying tribute to his father-in-law—the background of his father-in-law, who was a refugee from Europe. I think that speech summed up Senator Carr to me. He leaves this place with my enduring affection, having made a very deep impression upon me.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  I want to associate myself with all of the comments that have been made up to now in relation to Kim, and I thank Senator Scarr for his generous remarks. I think that for those of us in this place who've had a background in manufacturing and with the AMWU—and there are a number of those here—Kim Carr leaves a very important legacy in this place and more broadly across the Labor movement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Notwithstanding the fact that Kim was, and will continue to be, a formidable operator in the Labor movement, and that not everybody always agreed with Kim—sometimes famously—he is held in deep regard in the manufacturing sector, in the scientific community, in the research community and in higher education as really understanding the connection between Australian research and development and jobs for working-class and regional Australians in manufacturing. He understood that connection and understood the role that good, smart, forward-looking industry policy could play in building a better country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He had humble beginnings in Tumut and he loves the Snowy Mountains—as a Victorian, I expect that he's going to spend a significant part of his retirement in regional New South Wales. Kim is in fact one of the most well-read members of this Senate. He engages deeply with writing and research, much more in the UK Labour tradition—if I can put it that way—of understanding and having a real connection with the intellectual work, in terms of philosophy right across to science. That's something that will be missed. He is, I have to say, as another member of Labor's national executive, the longest-serving member of the National Executive of the Labor Party in its history, which is a remarkable achievement; he only stepped down recently. When you think of some of the characters in the Labor movement's history who served on that body, to be in the position where you are the longest-serving member is quite an achievement. His contribution to the movement is immense. As somebody who didn't always agree with Kim on a range of issues, what I can say about it is that you would always listen to Kim's view and you should always have respected Kim's view about these things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I understand it, we may have another opportunity where Kim himself may be able to make some remarks. I hope that that is the case, because he does deserve the opportunity to make some valedictory remarks in this place.</span>

The Scrutiny of Bills Committee had its last meeting, we suspect, of the 46th Parliament this morning, and Senator Carr was present with Senator Davey, Senator Scarr and myself. We reflected on the important work that the scrutiny committees of the Senate do. There's absolutely no doubt that this is an institution that evolves over time. Some of us, as conservatives, might be surprised to learn that. I've certainly learned that and come to understand that. But I think one of the evolutions of this place that is unsatisfactory is the loss of its scrutiny role and the loss of interest that senators bring to their scrutiny functions. Certainly Senator Carr stands as a powerful testament to the importance of the scrutiny function. As Senator Ayres just said, Senator Carr is absolutely someone who should be listened to. Certainly on scrutiny matters, we paid very close attention to him. We thank him very, very much for what is a very, very important legacy that he leaves to that function of the Senate.</span>

Right now, though, in case we don't get that opportunity, I want to say that Kim's absolutely enormous intelligence, the traditional, very masculine senatorial type that he has displayed, and his loud booming voice in this chamber will certainly be missed. In areas such as local content, industry policy, the Australian Research Council, manufacturing, higher education, antidumping, different elements of human rights and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, there is so much to have learned from and admired in Comrade Carr. He didn't always agree with everyone internally in the Labor Party, but that was actually a good thing because you would always learn from the robustness of that debate. He was never a shrinking violet about stepping up and having the debate, and we are better off for that fact. In that context, I feel like I've been able to learn a great deal from Senator Carr because of the visibility of the way that he has involved himself very publicly in those debates internally and, indeed, here in the parliament.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator URQUHART</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  I would like to add my remarks to the comments that have been made by senators on this side and on the other side as well. I have worked in this place with Kim for 11 years, but, for the 20 years before that, I worked with Kim as an AMWU organiser and state secretary. I always remember that, during the time when Kim was in the portfolio of industry, manufacturing and science, he was a frequent visitor to Tasmania. He came and visited the workplaces where I represented members, and I particularly remember a couple of those.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember a car component facility in Launceston that was having a lot of difficulty with finance and getting orders, and Kim stepped up to the plate. He got a delegation of Toyota and Ford executives together, he got the union representatives together and he got the ministers in the Victorian state parliament together, and we had a meeting. Out of that meeting, a number of things were forged, and that business continued to thrive for many years thereafter. Unfortunately, with the demise of the car industry, that business is no longer operating, but it was thanks to Kim that it got a number of years after that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other one was the Cadbury factory, which I had the ability to look after. That was probably one of my favourite places to look after. I remember many hours down there at that factory with Kim, talking about manufacturing, science, industry and innovation. At that time, the food industry was going through a lot of innovation, getting rid of a lot of manual handling work and with a lot of machinery and robotics coming in. We always called on Kim as part of the AMWU to come and look at these places to work through processes with us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He will be missed here. Senator Pratt said his booming voice was never shy in the chamber, nor in our meetings. Obviously, in our caucuses you always heard Kim when he wanted to speak. I do hope he gets the opportunity to come back, but I know that he will look forward to being able to walk his two little grandsons to school almost every day now. I know he missed that during the long lockdowns when he stayed here in Canberra. I thank you, Kim, for your contribution in your public life and also to the union movement.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PAYNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Women</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  by leave—I rise to provide a ministerial statement on the 2022-23 Women's Budget Statement and I do so with great pride.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge my colleagues in the Women's portfolio—the Minister for Women's Safety, Senator Ruston; the Minister for Women's Economic Security, Senator Hume; and the Assistant Minister for Women, Senator Stoker. I acknowledge the Prime Minister as co-chair of the Cabinet Taskforce for Women's Safety and Economic Security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government's commitment to improving the lives of Australian women and girls is founded on the right that each and every girl and woman in Australia has to be safe and healthy and to be treated equally. Equality is the foundation of a cohesive community and a strong, productive, prosperous economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Women's Budget Statement released with the budget overnight builds on the strong foundations established by last year's record investment of $3.4 billion in women's safety, economic security and leadership, and health and wellbeing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our further commitment of $2.1 billion includes both new initiatives and the extension and expansion of initiatives that are underway and delivering. Our 2022-23 commitment brings our total investment to more than $5.8 billion since 2018 to improve the lives of women and girls across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today women's workforce participation has reached the highest level recorded, at 62.4 per cent, with 1.1 million more women in work today than in 2013.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The gender pay gap has narrowed to 13.8 per cent, which is significantly lower than the then 17.4 per cent gap that we inherited when we were elected in 2013.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the rates of violence against women remain unacceptably high, but we can see that awareness of family, domestic and sexual violence is improving and attitudes towards women are changing. And this government is working continuously with states and territories, with stakeholders, with frontline organisations, with communities, with victims-survivors and with many others to reduce those rates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, about 250,000 families with more than one child under five are benefitting due to our changes in relation to the childcare subsidy, from reduced out-of-pocket costs on child care, giving them greater flexibility and choice in the way they live and run their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Women's safety</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government is committed to an Australia that is free from violence against women and children, and where women are safe at home, at work, at school, in the community and online. This budget includes a further $1.3 billion to improve outcomes for women's safety, and I particularly acknowledge the Minister for Women's Safety, Senator Anne Ruston, for her leadership in bringing this package forward. This brings the Commonwealth's investment in women's safety to $2.5 billion to support the transition to and implementation of the next <span style="font-style:italic;">National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children 2022-2032</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that ending violence requires the efforts of all levels of government, of business, of non-government organisations, of the community and, frankly, of individuals themselves, of course. Our investment is targeted around prevention, early intervention, response and recovery. Minister Ruston and I have been clear and consistent: to end gendered violence, we must prevent it from happening in the first place. That is why the government is investing over $200 million in prevention initiatives. We are expanding the role of the national prevention organisation, Our Watch, and extending the strong, successful Stop it at the Start campaign. We are establishing a new national consent campaign and investing more strongly in community-led prevention programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we pursue that important goal of reducing and ultimately ending violence against women, it is critical that women have access to frontline services and that they get the support they need. The government is building on last year's commitment, providing a further $480 million to response services. That includes $240 million to extend the escaping violence payment, providing up to $5,000 for women escaping violence and beginning a new life. That funding has already supported around 37,500 Australian women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also committing new funding of over $290 million to enable victims-survivors to rebuild their lives. In the New South Wales Illawarra region, we are investing $25 million to establish Australia's first women's trauma recovery centre. This will be a safe place for those women who have been in the most unsafe of situations. And we acknowledge those leaders who have been part of that work, in the Illawarra in particular, in bringing this forward in this budget. We are also spending $100 million on a further phase for the Safe Places program for emergency and transitional accommodation, delivering about 720 new places. For women who find themselves in violent households, the Keeping Women Safe in their Homes program provides support to safely remain at home. Around 30,000 women will be supported this way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise, too, importantly, that the digital world is increasingly unsafe for women, and that is why this budget provides over $31 million for online safety initiatives, led by Julie Inman-Grant, the eSafety Commissioner. We will begin phase 2 of the national online safety campaign to help keep women and children safe online and support the eSafety Commissioner to establish an online safety community grants program for education and support projects for community, sporting and faith groups.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-weight:bold;">
                  </span>
                  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Women's economic security</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a government, we also have a strong focus on improving women's economic security, and I have referred to those factors of women's workforce participation and the narrowing of the gender pay gap previously. I would also remind the Senate of the nearly 50-year low we see in women's unemployment. These are important achievements, but we recognise that there is more to do. This year's investment of over $480 million in women's economic security will focus on improving flexibility and choice for women in Australia. It will also support their entry into more diverse industries, into jobs of the future and into leadership positions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are investing over $346 million to establish enhanced paid parental leave for families. It will enable eligible working parents to share up to 20 weeks of fully flexible leave. We are encouraging fathers to take government paid leave in conjunction with employer funded leave, in the same way in which women are currently able to do. The government is also broadening the paid parental leave income test to include a household income threshold of $350,000 per year. Practically, this means eligible families will have full control over how they choose to use their paid leave, empowering them, again, to make decisions that work for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further measures in this budget are focused, as well, on helping women into higher-paying and diversified sectors. Significant demand, for example, is forecast for the tech workforce, so we're providing $3.9 million over two years to support more women into digitally skilled roles. This demonstrates our government's active creation of pathways for women to pursue, for example, a mid-career transition into a higher-paid career in the tech workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Achieving gender equality more broadly continues to be a priority for the Australian government. Earlier this month, our government fulfilled a commitment from last year's Women's Budget Statement, releasing our review of the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012. We will implement all 10 recommendations of that review. The budget provides further resources for the Workplace Gender Equality Agency to implement those recommendations and to support the private sector—the largest employer of women in Australia—to close the gender pay gap and increase women's workforce participation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that having women in leadership positions ensures more balanced decision-making, provides role models and mentors for the next generation of young girls and works to reduce the gender pay gap. We're making a further investment of over $18 million for the Women's Leadership and Development Program, because we know that great leaders also start young. We're expanding the successful Future Female Entrepreneurs Program to develop and grow women's core entrepreneurial skills. Australia has world-leading female entrepreneurs—for example, Melanie Perkins, the CEO and co-founder of the tech start-up Canva, and Kayla Itsines, who's using the power of technology and apps to become one of the world's most successful online fitness entrepreneurs. Future Female Entrepreneurs is an opportunity to grow even more of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To support women facing unique barriers to leadership and employment, we are also expanding the Future Women Jobs Academy. I do believe that you can't be it if you can't see it. To aim high, it helps to see others who have had and taken the opportunity to lead and achieve, and I'm very proud of the role of the Women's Leadership and Development Program in what it is doing across Australia, touching tens of thousands of Australian women in its work. On International Women's Day I launched a new Women's Leadership and Development Program open competitive grants round, inviting organisations to apply under the Lead and Succeed grant opportunity, which will support projects that address the structural and systemic barriers that can impede women's employment and their progression into leadership. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The health of women and girls is critical to their overall wellbeing and their ability to fully participate in society and the workforce. In this budget, we're investing over $330 million over four years to support the health and wellbeing of women and girls at every stage of their lives. We're investing in endometriosis support, in breast and cervical cancer screening and in support for families who have experienced stillbirth or miscarriage. I would venture to say that there's not a senator in this place or a member in the House of Representatives who has not, through their personal life, their family life or their professional life, encountered a woman who is dealing with those challenges, particularly the ones that I've specifically mentioned here today. As a member of the government, I have seen the response to these announcements to be deeply moving and profoundly important for the many women who deal with issues such as endometriosis—and, of course, the many who deal with diagnoses of breast or cervical cancer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Addressing inequities in health care, not only between women and men but between different groups of women and girls, is a key focus of our National Women's Health Strategy. We're investing $4.2 million to fund community led initiatives and organisations to support women and girls at higher risk of poorer health outcomes, with a focus on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, on migrant and refugee women, on older women and on women with disabilities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I bring the Women's Budget Statement here this afternoon in this ministerial statement—the second Women's Budget Statement delivered by the Morrison government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Its focus is important. Its focus on women's safety, on women's economic security and on women's leadership and development is important for Australian women and girls. But, in doing so, I acknowledge—and I believe my colleagues acknowledge—that although we have made substantial progress in the development of these women's budget statements—and their predecessors, the Women's Economic Security Statements—we know there is more to do. That's why these plans are in this Women's Budget Statement and that is our commitment to the future for Australian women and girls.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, observing the last nine years of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments provokes an interesting question. What would it take to motivate this government to act on women's issues, to do something? Would the fact that women over the age of 60 are the fastest growing cohort of people facing homelessness be enough? Apparently not. Would it be an intractable gender pay gap or the lack of access to affordable childcare? Nope. Would it be that approximately one woman a week is murdered by a current or former partner, or that a domestic violence incident is recorded by police on average every two minutes? Not that either. It turns out that the only time that this government has been willing to act on women's interests is when there is a political problem to be solved. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year the government restored the Women's Budget Statement—cobbled it together in haste after crowds of Australian women across the country came together and marched for justice. Their demands were clear: Australian women want safety and respect in their work, in their home. They want to be full and equal participants in all aspects of society. They want their voices heard when decisions are made. This year's Women's Budget Statement has been pulled together in the shadow of a looming federal election. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has spent nine years—nine wasted years—demonstrating to Australian women that it has no interest in the issues and challenges that we face. All we have seen is neglect, political fixes and election patch jobs. It is no surprise—no surprise at all—that after a decade of this Liberal government things have gone backwards for Australian women. Women are facing skyrocketing costs of living, record high childcare fees, stagnant wages, an intractable gender pay gap, insecure work, skills shortages and rising rates of sexual assault. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has failed once again to deliver the serious reforms necessary to pursue women's economic security. The budget does nothing on childcare costs, which are eating a bigger and bigger hole in household budgets. Tweaks to paid parental leave are welcome, but the government is just tinkering around the edges of a scheme that they have tried five times to slash. We have long memories. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Women's Budget Statement still doesn't provide a firm commitment to making employers report their gender pay gaps to the public like the Prime Minister's own department recommended, and the government makes no commitment to improve pay or conditions for women working in undervalued care sectors like aged care. The Morrison government is still refusing to fully implement the recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report on sexual harassment in the workplace, and there is no ongoing funding to establish new working women's centres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor acknowledges the long overdue investment in women's safety through the next National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children, but of course we still don't have a final plan or the consultation that underpins it. If you look at the details, the budget shows a short-term sugar hit in the next year just in time for an election, but in each and every year after that in real terms the budget allocation to women's safety declines. It means that in three years the funding will be half of what it is next year. It's reflective of the overall approach because, as I said at the start of my remarks, this is exactly what it looks like when a Prime Minister sees women's safety as another political problem to fix rather than an opportunity to do real good. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing in this budget makes up for a decade of attacks on wages and job security. Seventy-seven per cent of Australian women say the cost-of-living pressures have gotten worse over the last year, and, when you look at the details of this budget, prices are rising while real wages are going backwards. The average Australian will be $1,355 worse off. We know that Australian women deserve better than this. It is why an Albanese Labor government will deliver budgets that work for all Australians. On this, I'd like to acknowledge the work of my colleague Ms Plibersek, Labor's shadow minister for women in the other place. As part of the Rudd-Gillard government, Ms Plibersek was integral to the first National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. Her energy and advocacy have not diminished in any way in the intervening period.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To stop the decline in women's economic security and get women back on track after COVID, Labor will set up an independent women's economic security taskforce to help government make smart, targeted investments, through our first budget and beyond, to advance economic equality. We'll make sure the decisions we make in government support equality through a national strategy to achieve gender equality. We will introduce such a strategy to guide whole-of-government actions on this key metric. Labor will strengthen the Office for Women so that it can oversee the implementation of gender impact assessments and provide advice on policies that impact on the social and economic wellbeing and participation of Australian women. We will introduce gender impact assessments on relevant cabinet submissions and new policy proposals. Labor will deliver an annual women's budget statement—something that should never have been abolished—to assess the impact new budget measures have on women and examine how the allocation of public resources affects gender equality. Labor is committed to half our parliamentarians being women because when more women are at the decision-making table Australian women know their interests and values are being represented. Finally, Labor will provide the sustained commitment that is necessary to address men's violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Australian women want a government on their side, and that is what Labor, under Anthony Albanese and his team, will deliver.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="296215" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COX</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:47</span>):  I rise to take note of the Women's Budget Statement for 2022-23. I want to start by saying that the Morrison government have seriously bungled their last chance to show they have what it takes to provide women's safety and economic security. The half-measures and spin put into the budget announcement yesterday are seriously underwhelming. But it's no surprise, because there is an election looming. It's no wonder that the Morrison government are desperately trying to improve their standing with Australian women, who have abandoned them in droves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the announcements are a step in the right direction. We particularly welcome the allocation of $25 million to the Illawarra Women's Trauma Recovery Centre, which in fact the Greens have championed—and I want to acknowledge the great work of our leader in the Senate, Senator Larissa Waters, who's not here with us today. But this budget is really a large grab bag of minimal measures that fall well short of what we know it takes to make women safe and ensure the economic security of women here in Australia. I say this because in my sector—the sector I came from when I joined the Senate—funding to address gendered violence falls well short of what women's organisations say is needed, what they have told this government time and time again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the Greens who have committed to calling for what the sector are asking for, which is $1 billion per annum for frontline services to meet the existing demand. It is unconscionable to underfund services which will stop women being killed in this country in the epidemic of domestic violence. Whilst awareness-raising and training are absolutely crucial, they should be in addition to rather than instead of frontline and specialist services that the sector says it needs to meet the critical shortfall in supporting women and children who are fleeing family and domestic violence in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's so-called 'enhanced' paid parental leave plan also does not increase the PPL payments. It doesn't add superannuation contributions and does nothing to actually incentivise shared care. In fact, it may have an opposite or perverse effect, leading mothers to take all 20 weeks of their parental leave while fathers take none. But the Greens have an alternative: 26 weeks PPL payments which would match salaries of up to $100,000. Superannuation would be added along with use-it-or-lose-it incentives built in to encourage shared parenting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The $100 million promised for crisis transition and affordable housing is pitiful and small compared to the $7.6 billion investment the sector says it needs to provide emergency and permanent housing for women, particularly for older women at risk of homelessness. The much-trumpeted expansion of the family home guarantee is no help, because it simply will increase house prices and encourage people to get into debt they just cannot afford.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again this government has shown a lack of commitment to addressing family violence against First Nations women. Instead of a dedicated, standalone national plan to end violence against First Nations women in this country, they say there will be a First Nations action plan sitting underneath the national plan. This is clearly not what we—Senator Thorpe, sitting here, and I—have been asking for. But they've also baked real cuts into community controlled First Nations family violence services over the forward estimates and delivered no funding at all for the sector's peak body. That is a disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget will not close the gender pay gap. Child care is still not free, care work is still undervalued and the minimum wage and income support payments, which women and men receive, are still too low. This budget will not deliver economic security for women in this country. I welcome the additional funds for the Human Rights Commission to monitor the Respect@Work recommendation, but this is still being undermined by the broader cuts to the commission's budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that there is still no commitment to the key recommendation of a positive duty to all employers to make workplaces across this country safe for women. Australian women have spent nearly a decade trying to convince this government that their safety and economic security are issues that must be taken seriously. We have marched. Last year was the March4Justice on the front parliament lawn. But, in place of decisive and material action, we have been served talkfests, cabinet reshuffles, flowery speeches and shiny baubles by a toxic, arrogant government that treats women as a PR problem to be managed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was the PM's last opportunity to stand up for Australian women, and once again he has failed. He has failed because, unfortunately, he's a sexist dinosaur, and it's long past time to give him and his boys club the boot. The time is now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government condemns in the strongest possible terms Russia's illegal and unprovoked invasion of its smaller democratic neighbour Ukraine. This invasion is a gross violation of international law, including the Charter of the United Nations. We have called and continue to call on Russia to immediately withdraw its forces from Ukrainian territory, consistent with the legally binding decision of the International Court of Justice passed on 16 March.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has been proud to stand with over 140 countries in condemning this invasion in the UN General Assembly on two occasions in the last month. There is a strong sense of unity around the world about standing up to protect the rules based global order, built on the UN Charter, on international law and institutions and on respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. Australia is part of this strong, unified coalition against Russia's illegal war. We are working with partners to impose a high cost on Russia and to provide support to Ukraine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Monday I spoke again with the Ukrainian foreign minister, Mr Dmytro Kuleba. I strongly reiterated Australia's continuing support to his country and its people and our firm commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. I conveyed our outrage at Russia's escalation of indiscriminate attacks, which are exacting a catastrophic humanitarian toll and creating the fastest growing refugee crisis since the Second World War.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reports of atrocities are appalling: the bombing of a school in Mariupol where a reported 400 civilians were sheltering, reports of forced deportations of Mariupol residents to Russia, an airstrike on a theatre in Mariupol where civilians were again sheltering, the bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol. Over 10 million people have been forced to flee their homes, at least 3.9 million of those to neighbouring countries, more than half of whom are children. Civilian causalities continue to rise. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has confirmed 1,179 killed and 1,860 injured—though we feel these numbers are much higher.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Humanitarian convoys have been unable to reach key cities to support those civilians so dreadfully impacted by Russia's illegal invasion. That is completely unacceptable. As I have said publicly, both in this chamber and elsewhere, the targeting of innocent civilians and the targeting of civilian infrastructure are war crimes, and the President of Russia must be held to account. Let me be clear: there is one reason and one reason alone why there is a humanitarian disaster in Ukraine. It is the direct result of the unprovoked, unjustified and illegal invasion by Russia. Russia must uphold its obligations under international law, including the protection of civilians, and permit humanitarian access inside Ukraine and safe passage for civilians trying to flee the violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To support the Ukrainian people, Australia is so far providing $65 million in humanitarian funding and working with trusted humanitarian partners, including with a focus on the most vulnerable people—children, women, the elderly and people with disabilities. This week we also announced our cooperation with the United Kingdom to deliver humanitarian relief, including blankets, hygiene kits, kitchen sets and lighting, to displaced Ukrainians. We are also supporting Ukraine's energy security by donating at least 70,000 tonnes of thermal coal. To further assist Ukrainians who have been forced to flee, we have issued over 5,000 visas to Ukrainian citizens, with more underway. In excess of 1,100 Ukrainians have already arrived in Australia, and I know that they have arrived to the warmth and support of the embrace of the Australian people, who stand with them and with their country at this time. I thank and acknowledge the Australian people for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, a resolution to this humanitarian disaster can only come from the withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory. It has been both profound and sobering to see the tremendous courage and determination with which the Ukrainians are fighting. Australia pays tribute to their strength and resilience, and, in this motion, so will the Senate. The capabilities of the armed forces of Ukraine and the sheer will of the Ukrainian people, as well as the determination of the international community to uphold the rules based order, were self-evidently not understood by President Putin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The world is working to supply and provide critical military assistance to Ukraine. Australia alone is providing $91 million in defensive military assistance. At the same time, Australia and our partners are imposing a high economic toll on Russia, with a focus on the elites and those who are responsible for this invasion or hold the levers of power in Russia and also in Belarus. Australia has listed more than 500 individuals and entities to date. They include President Putin and his circle of oligarchs and propagandists. This is the largest ever imposition of sanctions by Australia against a single country. Our listings include 80 per cent of Russia's banking sector and all government entities that handle Russia's sovereign debt. Our coordinated action with partners significantly undermines Russia's ability to continue financing President Putin's war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recognition of the importance of the strategic contest over information, those sanctioned also include propagandists and purveyors of disinformation who have peddled such false narratives about this invasion. We have sanctioned military commanders and members of parliament, as well as those who facilitated the invasion from outside Russia, including, as I said, the leadership of neighbouring Belarus. We also condemn actions by third-party countries that would enable and facilitate Russia's invasion, including through economic, military and political support. We have prohibited exports of alumina, impacting a key Russian industry, and also the import of Russian oil, refined petroleum products, gas and coal. A significant portion of Russia's foreign exchange reserves has been frozen, and the Russian economy is increasingly cut off from Western markets. Major international firms have suspended their operations in or with Russia. Many other businesses are reluctant to trade with Russia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While this invasion is an unparalleled breach of international law and the UN charter, it is also an escalation of the pattern of repressive and aggressive behaviour by Russia under this president. President Putin's Russia has for years silenced political opposition and critics. Sergei Magnitsky, the Ukrainian-born Russian lawyer who exposed massive fraud committed by Russian government officials, was one of those silenced. Mr Magnitsky was arrested, imprisoned, subjected to degrading treatment and tortured. He died in custody in 2009, having been denied medical treatment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under laws this parliament passed in December, we will hold the perpetrators of serious human rights abuses and corruption to account. Yesterday, the government listed 14 Russian individuals responsible for the corruption that Sergei Magnitsky uncovered and his subsequent imprisonment, and a further 25 individuals complicit in his torture and death. Those individuals will be subject to targeted financial sanctions and travel bans. In doing so, we honour Mr Magnitsky and all who defend the rule of law. We also acknowledge former senator Kimberley Kitching, such a strong supporter of these laws, who worked closely with the government to ensure their passage. This is the first of what will be ongoing sanctions using the Magnitsky-style thematic frameworks which enable us to impose costs on and deter those responsible for the most egregious human rights violations and abuses and serious corruption.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Russia must stop its invasion; Russia must get out of Ukraine. Until that happens, Australia and our partners will continue to impose costs on Russia and support Ukraine. We look forward to welcoming, by virtual means, President Zelenskyy when he addresses our parliament and does us the honour of speaking to our parliament tomorrow.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:06</span>):  I rise to speak in support of this motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been just over 34 days, I think, since President Putin invaded the country of Ukraine. It was and remains an illegal and unprovoked invasion, an immoral war against the innocent men, women and children of Ukraine. Mr Putin and the Russian forces are laying waste to homes, schools, hospitals and towns. Mr Putin's war is inflicting immense loss of life and untold damage. Cities like Mariupol lie in ruin; over 170,000 civilians remain under siege as we sit here. Nearly a quarter of the people of Ukraine have been forced from their homes, including more than half of the country's children, and over three million refugees have fled to neighbouring countries. Ukrainian community groups have spoken about Russia forcibly transferring thousands of Ukrainian citizens to Russian territory, in clear violation of international humanitarian law. Innocent civilians have been targeted. The image of a pregnant woman being carried from a maternity hospital hit by a Russian airstrike will be seared into our memories—a defining moment in this horrific and unjust war—and we have read harrowing reports of rape and sexual violence. This clear targeting of innocent civilians is nothing short of a war crime. Europe, once again in our lifetime, finds itself in a time of war, something all of us—the whole world—hoped never to witness again after what was the tragedy of World War II.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amidst the tragedy, of course, we see such courage. The people of Ukraine and their government have withstood the attacks on their homeland. They continue to fight bravely, defending their country from this illegal invasion. Russian soldiers have been met with a determined Ukrainian resistance, and the facts on the ground show that Vladimir Putin is not winning this war. The people of Ukraine have been bolstered by a unified response from NATO, the United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom, who have stood united against this invasion. Comprehensive financial and economic sanctions continue to raise the costs of Mr Putin's aggression.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And they have been backed by other nations, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Singapore, also implementing targeted sanctions against those responsible. Importantly, NATO has been revitalised. It has demonstrated its resolve as a defensive alliance and increased its deployments to Eastern Europe. Germany has overturned decades of strategic policy by allowing the provision of German-made weapons and materiel to third countries and by providing direct military support to Ukraine. Chancellor Scholz has rapidly expanded Germany's expenditure on defence and on energy diversification in response to Russia's action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the UN General Assembly last month, 141 countries voted to condemn Russia's illegal invasion, but Russia is not without friends—one of which is China. Just weeks before the invasion of Ukraine, China signed a no-limits friendship with Moscow. We've seen China declining to condemn the illegal invasion. In siding with Russia, China has abandoned two foreign policy orthodoxies it has held for decades: sovereignty and noninterference. China has failed in its special responsibility as a permanent member of the UN Security Council to uphold the UN Charter, whilst offering Russia relief from sanctions. There are many reasons to be concerned about these developments, particularly in light of China's growing assertiveness and, at times, aggression in our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't know how this conflict will end, but we do know that there will be more suffering, there will be more displacement and there will be more innocent lives lost. We know that more will be demanded of NATO members to help Ukraine defend itself. We also know Russia will increasingly be isolated from the world and Mr Putin's enablers will be held to account, and we commit ourselves to ensuring that occurs. We urge Mr Putin and his supporters to heed the calls of the international community to pull back and return to the negotiating table and to realise, as Secretary-General Guterres has said, this is actually an unwinnable war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our support for Ukraine sovereignty and territorial integrity will not waver. Labor have urged the government to impose the most comprehensive sanctions available. We have welcomed each tranche of sanctions against Mr Putin and his backers, and we continue to stand ready to work with the government on any additional measures. We will continue to support the provision of both lethal and non-lethal aid and humanitarian assistance in Ukraine at this time of urgent need. As Mr Albanese said some weeks ago now, all Australians stand with the people of Ukraine in the face of Mr Putin's unprovoked, illegal and immoral invasion of their homeland.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:14</span>):  I rise to put on the record the Greens' support for this motion for the people of Ukraine. Our hearts go out to the people of Ukraine, who are suffering so much from this brutal war that is being waged upon them by Russia, and we condemn Russia's military aggression against Ukraine as we condemn all violent aggression of this type. Russia's war in Ukraine is absolutely catastrophic for global peace. When talking about the war, the images and the stories that we have heard just reinforce how the cost of war is borne by ordinary people—the sheer figures that a quarter of the Ukrainian population, 10 million people, have had to flee their homes. We've got three million people who have fled Ukraine, and many people are either dead or wounded. The whole country is being traumatised by this appalling war, this appalling invasion. We affirm our support for the right of the people of Ukraine to sovereignty and territorial integrity, and we support the measures that are outlined in this Senate motion. We call upon the global community to work together, even more than they have been, to support additional non-violent measures to apply extra pressure on Russia to get them to withdraw.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two things in particular that we would like to see the Australian government work multilaterally to get more global support for. One is debt forgiveness. The world could move to forgive Ukraine's debt, which is worth about $129 billion. That would free up their resources to be able to withstand the Russian invasion. The second is that we're calling on the world to reduce its reliance on Russian fossil fuels, absolutely as quickly and as urgently as possible. The sale of gas and oil from Russia is worth about $120 billion a year to them. That $120 billion a year is what is funding and fuelling the Russian war machine. We know the issues of the energy needs in Europe, particularly in Germany but also in other European countries, and the fact that they feel at the moment that they have no choice and that they have to keep on importing Russian gas and oil. But I say the world needs to work with Europe, including Germany, to work out how we can very quickly remove their reliance on Russian gas and oil and support them in shifting to other energy, particularly renewable energies, which we in Australia are well placed to help to supply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a situation where there is potentially further military aggression against Russia. We know the risks of doing that. We know that at this stage it's very easy to say, 'What else can we do?' We have this violence of Russia against Ukraine, but we know that if there is further military aggression—if, for example, a no-fly zone were instituted—there is the potential of it escalating into World War III. To safeguard our future, we need to work on what other measures we can put in place that haven't got that incredibly high risk, including the incredibly high risk of escalation into nuclear war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although it seems really difficult to work out how Germany could wean itself quickly off Russian gas and oil, I say that Australia and the world need to work with Europe, including Germany, to work out just how we can make that happen so that we can safeguard our future. The world at this moment has to unite for peace. We have to work together. There are more mechanisms that we can use through the United Nations to respond collectively and decisively to de-escalate the situation and work for peace. My colleague Senator Steele-John is going to be talking more about these measures.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:19</span>):  I thank the government, and Minister Payne in particular, for moving this motion, and I am pleased to join with Senator Wong and the rest of my Labor Senate colleagues in supporting it. I also had two motions on today's <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>, one regarding the war in Ukraine and the second regarding the downing of flight MH17. I have already spoken earlier today during senators' statements in regard to the issue in Ukraine. I was telling people that my father-in-law immigrated from Ukraine, so my husband, Robert, is of Ukrainian descent and still has relatives in Ukraine. As you can imagine, this makes the situation in Ukraine very deeply personal for both me and my family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a Tasmanian of Ukrainian descent, Robert is an active member of the Tasmanian Ukrainian community. The community has been holding regular rallies since the invasion, calling for peace, and I've had the privilege of being able to speak at some of the rallies in both Hobart and Launceston. Speaking to the Ukrainians at these rallies, I understand that their only desire for their country and for their families and friends back home is peace. Many of them hold grave concerns about loved ones in Ukraine, and we've heard that more than 10 million people have been forced to flee their homes. Many cities are in ruin. Even the safer areas, like Lviv in Ukraine's west, aren't immune to attack. Ukrainian people are deeply patriotic and they're courageous. They rightly want the future of their democratic country to be determined by Ukrainians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ukraine has its own unique history, culture and identity, and the people there are a resilient people. This was the case when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, and it remains the case now that Ukraine has celebrated 30 years of independence. But it seems that the Russian government, particularly under the leadership of Mr Putin, has never truly accepted that. Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity have been under threat from Russia ever since they declared their independence. Russia's leadership was suspected of poisoning a pro-independence Ukrainian presidential candidate. They later installed a Russian puppet as President of Ukraine, who was then removed by the popular uprising known as the Revolution of Dignity. They illegally annexed Crimea and gave support to Donbas separatist rebels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The invasion of Ukraine is a further illegal act by the Russian Federation. It's an international crime. It's unjustified and it's unprovoked. But, in addition to this crime, Russia has committed further crimes through their actions during the invasion. The motion currently before the Senate mentions 3,000 dead or wounded civilians, in accordance with the United Nations' official figures, but Ukrainian authorities estimate that around 6,000 civilians may have been killed. Part of the reason for the high civilian death toll, as we've heard, is the deliberate targeting of civilians by Russian forces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned in my senators' statements speech earlier the stories of family and friends of Ukrainians in Tasmania. I was saying that there was a group of friends from Irpin who were tortured after being captured by Russian soldiers, and one of the friends was executed. Then there is the woman who fled with a seven-year-old son after their apartment building came under rocket attack, only to suffer a further attack on the bus they were escaping on, which was full of civilians. There are the residents of Russian occupied Kherson who have been fired on after protesting the invasion. These are just a few of the tragic stories I've heard, in addition to those that we've all heard on the news. These include a Russian air strike on a maternity hospital—an attack that injured 17 people, including pregnant women and children. For me, the most shocking was the air strike on the Donetsk regional theatre in Mariupol, where thousands of Ukrainian civilians were sheltering. Large signs clearly indicated that there were children sheltering there, yet the Russians still bombed it. The death toll from the theatre attack could be as high as 300.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have also been reports of Russian soldiers firing on civilians who were trying to escape Kyiv. These attacks achieved no military objective. The deliberate targeting of civilians is a war crime for which Russia must be held to account, and Labor stands shoulder to shoulder with the government, as Senator Wong said, in condemning Russia's illegal actions and making them accountable. This includes support for economic sanctions against Russia, including targeted sanctions against Mr Putin and those officials responsible for the invasion. It includes the provision of humanitarian aid to the suffering citizens of Ukraine and assistance in the form of military weaponry and equipment to help Ukraine defend itself. It also includes support for actions in the International Criminal Court and United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate allegations of humanitarian crimes committed by Russia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, Labor continue to offer our support for all efforts by the Australian government to bring to justice the perpetrators of the illegal attack on Malaysia Airlines MH17 by Russian backed rebels, which led to the murder of 298 passengers and crew, including 38 Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are at least three good reasons, as I've said before, why Australia should be part of the global effort to pressure Russia to stop the invasion and withdraw its troops. Firstly, it is our responsibility to Australian citizens who are members of the Ukrainian diaspora, who are scared for the safety of their family members and close friends back in their home country. The second is because it's Australia's responsibility as a good global citizen to join its allies in upholding the rules based order that keeps the world relatively peaceful and stable. The third reason this invasion concerns Australia is that if it can happen to Ukraine it can happen to any other sovereign nation. Russia's attack must have real consequences. We must send a signal to the world that an unprovoked attack on a sovereign nation will not be tolerated and that the world will respond accordingly. The global community knows that this attack is unjustified, and so does Mr Putin, despite his ridiculous claims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through internet and broadcast media censorship, as well as a steady stream of Russian government propaganda, we know that Russian citizens are being kept in the dark as to their government's actions and agenda. Sadly, many Russians honestly believe that there is a need to de-Nazify Ukraine, or that civilians have been spared and their military greeted as liberators, because that is what the Russian state propaganda machine is telling them. Whatever excuse Mr Putin has given for the invasion, it is an act of megalomania by an autocratic despot. As we've heard, it is Mr Putin and his regime that will bear the responsibility for the bloodshed and suffering that has followed and will continue to follow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to commend the bravery and the resilience of the Ukrainian people. Despite the material advantages of Russia's forces, Ukraine's military have not only been able to hold them back from capturing a major Ukrainian city but have reportedly even regained some ground in recent days. We also hear stories like that of the 13 Ukrainian soldiers defending an island in the Black Sea, who responded with a defiant profanity—which I won't repeat here, because it's unparliamentary—to the Russian navy, who were demanding that they surrender.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ukrainian civilians have also demonstrated their courage and solidarity in the face of Russia's aggression. Who could not be inspired by the images of Ukrainian civilians standing in the path of advancing Russian troops and tanks? I mentioned earlier the citizens protesting in Russian occupied towns. The President of Ukraine has demonstrated solidarity with his citizens by remaining in the capital. What a great leader! The patriotic refrain of 'Heroiam slava!' or 'Glory to the heroes!' that I've heard uttered at the rallies in Tasmania has a particular resonance during these awful times. I and the whole world were moved to tears when we saw the viral video of seven-year-old Amelia singing 'Let it Go' in a Kyiv bomb shelter and then singing the Ukrainian national anthem in front of a crowd of thousands at a stadium in parliament—in fact I've got goosebumps just remembering that now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said, Ukrainians are a truly remarkable people. They are resilient, and they will rebuild. Let's continue to stand together, as Australians amid the global community, in solidarity with Ukraine to end this atrocious war. Slava Ukraini! Glory to Ukraine!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I seek leave to have Senator Farrell's speech on Ukraine incorporated into <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>. It has been agreed with the Government Whip.</span>

                  <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:29</span>):  I stand in full support of this motion and I am encouraged by the words and fully support all of the actions taken by the government, as articulated by Senator Payne. I share Senator Wong's concerns as well. However, I wish to add some words. I have called for the Australian government to expel the Russian ambassador from Australia. News of Russian war crimes in Ukraine, including indiscriminate attacks on civilians, leaves no doubt that the Russian regime has chosen to place their country outside the company of civilised nations. The Russian bombing of a children's hospital in Mariupol and, indeed, the theatre, as Senator Bilyk alluded to, are just the latest set of atrocities—and there will be more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Russian military also confirmed the use of thermobaric weapons. The use of these devastating fuel-air explosives in urban areas will unquestionably violate the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which outlaws a wide range of barbaric weaponry. Barbarism is what President Putin's regime is engaged in across Ukraine. Aggressive war is a war crime. So too are the terrorist tactics employed by the Russian forces engaged in this war of aggression. In these circumstances, Foreign Minister Senator Payne's arguments that it is necessary to keep the Russian ambassador in Canberra to maintain a direct line of communication with the Russian government sends precisely the wrong signals to Moscow. It suggests that, no matter what President Putin does, Australia still wants to talk to his henchmen. Yet there is no evidence that the Australian government's direct line of communication has any influence or value whatsoever. Australia should immediately expel the Russian ambassador in Canberra and their consul-general in Sydney.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="250156" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEELE-JOHN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:32</span>):  Tonight the Senate debates a motion of solidarity and support for the people of Ukraine in this most terrible moment, this time of war. It is altogether fit and proper that we are here tonight engaging in this debate. Over the last four weeks, we have seen a full-scale humanitarian disaster unfold across Ukraine as people have had their lives destroyed and have fled in the face of tanks and guns, at the hands of a Russian oligarch and the media and military that he commands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians have seen this unfold in devastating real time. We have followed the people of Kherson in their heroic resistance against occupation. We have shed a tear as images of Kharkiv have been streamed to our phones and across our television screens. We have watched the people of Odesa fill sandbags and look out to a freezing, iron-grey sea, wondering when the ships will come. We have heard the cries of the fearful children of Lviv, who wait every night in the knowledge that the destruction that they have witnessed in Kyiv—the rockets, the bombs, the planes, from which they have fled—is following them there. Never before in real time have the results of war been so readily available to be seen, so accessible, so immediate to all those who may wonder what the result of war is, what the reality of war is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Already we have seen across the Ukrainian nation generational scars of the type that only war can cause lashed into the community. Thousands have died. Tens of thousands have had their homes destroyed or have been wounded. Millions have fled for their lives into western Ukraine, Poland and Romania. They have left with the clothes on their backs and with whatever they could cram into a suitcase, and they have often done so knowing that their mothers and fathers have stayed behind to fight, to build molotov cocktails or to place their bodies between their grandparents and the oncoming army.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At home in Perth I have seen people come together—members of the Ukrainian community and people of Ukrainian heritage. A few weeks ago I attended a vigil in St Mary's Cathedral. I was struck by the amount of young people that came out to show solidarity with the Ukrainian people, to come together in one voice and utter the words into the darkness and the fear that it contained, into the uncertainty which was the very essence of the gloom, 'Slava Ukraini'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The solidarity that we demonstrate tonight in the passage of this moment must go beyond the words of the motion itself. We must put into action serious steps designed to bring peaceful resolution to this war that has already inflicted so much damage and pain on so many. We must go beyond these words of solidarity and, as we work to put them into action, work not as individual nations but as a global community in unison to ensure that Vladimir Putin and his dictatorial regime are held to account and that the people of Ukraine are provided with the support that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The United Nations as an institution was created in the aftermath of the Second World War as a global human attempt to prevent any generation from ever again experiencing the horrors of global war. The mechanisms set up within that international institution were designed to mitigate the dangers of conflict and to enable the world to come together and prevent such violent and atrocious acts as we are seeing take place in Ukraine today. The mechanism which is most relevant, I believe, to this particular crisis is the 'Uniting for Peace' resolution—resolution 377A. This resolution exists to be used when the Security Council is unable to come to a unanimous position. The resolution enables for all actions which may be considered by the Security Council to instead be considered by the entirety of the General Assembly. Such a session under that resolution has been called and has resulted in an international statement of condemnation of Russia's unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine and its violation of that nation's sovereignty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the Australian Greens are calling on the Australian government to work with our international partners, and with our friends in the region and across the globe, to ensure that that session is reconvened with two primary purposes. In addition to those of an immediate halt to the violence and a full withdrawal of Russian forces—an end to this carnage—we are also calling for an international effort to provide Ukraine with debt relief. The nation of Ukraine, with which we are expressing our solidarity tonight, is some $129 billion indebted to the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission. In the last few months alone they have been forced to attempt to make millions of dollars and euros in payments on those debts, something no nation should have to do in the middle of such a war. No global benefit can be gained by attempting to pursue debt that Ukraine does not have the ability to repay in its current situation, and so Australia should use its position in the United Nations to champion global debt relief as part of our solidarity with Ukraine. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, we would see this resolution mechanism used to support Germany and other nations of the world, currently highly reliant on Russian oil and gas, to transition urgently away from the purchasing of that gas and oil to other forms of power, particularly renewable energy. We must be clear: Russia is a petro-state. The invasion of Ukraine, this war, is a petro-war. It is financed by fossil fuels. In fact, in 2021 alone, Russia made some US$119 billion from the sale of oil and gas. This is what is keeping the war machine going. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, here at home, Australia must do its part. We are happy to see that our calls for the end of Australian import of Russian oil have been taken up. However, we must go further. There must be a special humanitarian intake of no fewer than 20,000 refugees in relation to Ukraine, and the pausing of any temporary protection visas and the cancellation of any deportation orders of Ukrainian nationals until the crisis abated. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these actions are perfectly possible and are additional tangible ways that we can show our solidarity with the people of Ukraine, that we can turn our words and our actions to this point into concrete support for the Ukrainian people. We can do all of these things while pursuing peace, and supporting peace and nonviolence globally. We can do all of these things while centring peace as the goal, as a global community, and seizing on the opportunity that this moment presents to turn away from solutions to violent conflict that only forge further conflict, only destroy more lives. We can learn from history in this moment, provide aid to Ukraine and to its people in its recovery from this horrific invasion and ensure that more, tangibly, is done in this place and at this time than simply line the pockets of weapon manufacturers and global energy companies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally tonight I note that this motion calls upon the chamber and the government to come together in the condemnation of Russia's violation of international law. It asks the Russian Federation to cease its invasion and uphold its obligations under the human rights charter and the International Criminal Court. It is right and proper that we do this. It is also right and proper that we reflect, as the 10th anniversary of the invasion of Iraq comes into view, upon what role we may have played as a nation in supporting that particular illegal, unjustified invasion of Iraqi sovereignty, led by the United States government, and what role that participation may have played in the creation of an international community where Putin believes that he can get away with such a crime. This is an urgent reflection each legislator must consider. I thank the chamber for its time.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:45</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I want to note that peace and security are my goals. Yet often these conflict—part of the irony of the human condition—at a personal level and a global level. We do know some things for sure. War is ugly. There are many inhuman actions in even the smallest war. We also know that truth is always war's first casualty. We're told there are two sides to this issue in Ukraine. I want to discuss a third view. So far, we've only heard one view. I'll leave the other side to the Russians. They can talk for themselves; I'm not going to speak for the Russians. I want to discuss a third view. Having read widely in the last 14 years, I no longer swallow the crap we were fed at school and continue to be fed in the media.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Former Senator Ron Paul in the United States is acknowledged for trying to start a department of peace in America instead of a defence department. He had the respect, when he was in congress, of both sides of politics, Democrats and Republicans. He is very well known for his honesty, his competence and his sincerity. Ron Paul said that every major war since 1913 can be directly attributed to the United States Federal Reserve bank, which is controlled by globalists.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Steele-John just talked about Iraq. Mr President, I'd take your mind back to Iraq, and I remind people of what Mr Alexander Downer said when he retired. On his last night he said that, when John Howard came back from the 9/11 World Trade Center towers collapse in 2001, he walked into cabinet and said, 'We're off to Iraq.' And the cabinet followed, and Australia followed, and in that conflict we killed Australian men and women—young men and women. We also killed a lot of Iraqis and people of other nationalities. 'We're off to Iraq.' I can recall another incident, too, when Prime Minister Howard, Prime Minister Tony Blair from the United Kingdom and President George W Bush from the United States said, 'We're all going to go there because of weapons of mass destruction.' And then, quietly, the world was told they never had any evidence of weapons of mass destruction, but not one parliament, not one congress, held anyone accountable. It went similarly after the Vietnam War and so many other wars around the world, and, as Senator Steele-John just said, it was led on many occasions by the United States.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have huge admiration for the United States, having lived there for five years, been through all 50 states, worked in eight states and lived in eight states. I admire what the United States has done. I'm married to an American—a dual citizen of Australia and America. But I recognise now that I swallowed a lot of rubbish and propaganda from the Americans, because the government of America led many war efforts. The American people are fine, peace-loving people, but we have been taken into conflicts. So I'm open to alternative views on the Ukrainian issue, but we have no dog in this fight and we should stay out of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We repeatedly see decisions in the place—as people know, I can see—where there is data contradicting the reality, and yet, without any data, we blunder into things. We sometimes ignore the facts and data. And always, as one of the Labor senators pointed out, the people pay. So I raise questions. I question the narrative. I question the media narrative—it's one-way. I question the political narrative—it's one-way. I question the propaganda and the demonising. But I don't make statements without facts, and I don't know sufficient facts to take other than a third view here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I question the cost of fuel. The biggest impact on our fuel prices is not the Ukraine conflict; it's government taxes. Senator Hanson has flagged a reduction in excise duty. I question our capacity to defend ourselves, because we need manufacturing to produce weapons, armaments, tanks. We don't have that capacity anymore. We've been gutted by adherence to UN agreements—the Lima declaration, the Kyoto protocol. We see, today, the government setting aside money for injecting babies—babies!—with an untested vaccine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Payne, talk about the Russians now having to fight German weapons that are being given to Ukraine. But the Germans are giving them billions of dollars for gas, because the United Nations has destroyed Germany's capacity to look after its own energy needs. We have been disarmed. Germany is being disarmed. The only concrete thing I will say in this statement is that we need to get the hell out of the United Nations, not follow it, because the United Nations is pushing a war on humanity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not sufficiently informed to take a stance either way on this issue. I am, though, sufficiently informed to invite all senators to question what we're being told. I implore senators, first of all, to understand basic needs of humans and the needs that are driving these conflicts, whether they're domestic, national or international, and to understand that meeting universal human needs for security, basic interactions and connections is key. It is key to connection and key to relationships.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'd just ask people to question. I question how the Ukraine—I'm told by Senator Steele-John—is $129 billion in debt to the IMF, when it's one of the richest countries in the world. How is that possible? So I ask questions, and I take a third view.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is the first report I present to the Senate as Chair of the Committee. I thank the members of the committee for placing their trust in me, by electing me to the Chair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I also thank Senator Paul Scarr, the previous Chair, for all his great work and leadership.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee is of the view that the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity-also known as ACLEI- has performed satisfactorily against its revised performance framework in 2020-21.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee acknowledges the improved operational and investigative results achieved by ACLEI during the year. This committee was particularly interested in understanding how ACLEI managed its jurisdictional expansion, which occurred on 1 January 2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee notes that ACLEI and the expansion agencies have formed productive working relationships and appreciates that their work together is ongoing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee further notes that ACLEI is presently focused on: undertaking investigations and reporting in a timely manner; prioritising matters of serious and systemic corrupt conduct; maintaining a sustainable workload; and ensuring it is as transparent as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee acknowledges that ACLEI is increasingly seeking to share its corruption findings and making a valuable contribution to corruption prevention in the broader Commonwealth public service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">During the committee's public hearing to examine the ACLEI annual report, the committee inquired into ACLEl's organisational structure. Specifically, the acting arrangements that are in place when the Integrity Commissioner is unavailable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee found that although one of three officials from other Commonwealth integrity agencies can act for the Integrity Commissioner when needed, no deputy from within ACLEI can be called upon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As ACLEI and its jurisdiction have expanded considerably, the committee recommends that consideration should be given to establishing a Deputy Integrity Commissioner position within the agency for its ongoing sustainability. The committee's report contains one recommendation to this effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, it is my pleasure as the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to present the Committee's <span style="font-style:italic;">First periodic report on Human Rights</span>—the final outcome of the inquiry into certain aspects of the DFAT Annual Report 2019-20.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">During this parliament, the Joint Standing Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has conducted three human rights-related inquiries, which has led to the adoption of Magnitsky-style legislation in Australia and recommended actions that will protect the rights of women and girls in the Pacific, and assist in the elimination of child and forced marriage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee, through its Human Rights Sub-Committee, has a longstanding commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights, and to ensuring that the voices of the most marginalised and persecuted populations can be heard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure that attention continues to be given to causes of such dire need, and egregious crime, the Committee has resolved to hold a public hearing roundtable on an annual basis, focused on a particular area of human rights, as part of its inquiry into the annual report of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in addition to numerous briefings the Committee receives on topical human rights issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Furthermore, the Committee has until now not published a general report on human rights, nor had a formal process of informing the Parliament and the Australian people of the range of matters considered by the Committee. This report is intended to be used as a precedent for future periodic reports to the Parliament about human rights matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee remains gravely concerned by the evidence it heard at the public roundtable concerning the human rights situation in Ethiopia. It urges all parties to the conflict to exercise any and all measures to halt the grave human rights abuses that are currently being inflicted on the Ethiopian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While their may be little that Australia can do to materially improve the situation on the ground, we, nevertheless, have recommended that the Australian Government advocate through all available channels and measures for the restoration of peace in Tigray, and consider increasing its humanitarian assistance to respond to that crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">More broadly, the Committee remains concerned about the widespread prevalence of gross human rights violations and suppression of fundamental freedoms in many countries (for example Myanmar—as explored by the Foreign Affairs and Aid Sub-Committee) particularly the scale of violations against the people of Hong Kong, in the Xinjiang Province, and the prevalence of foreign interference in our own country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, I'd like to thank all submitters and those who appeared before the committee in public hearings for their contributions. I'd also like to thank the Committee secretariat, the entire Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and in particular I'd like to thank and acknowledge Mr Kevin Andrews.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Kevin has made an enormous contribution to this Parliament, serving in various Ministerial roles, including as Minister for Defence, and representing the people of Menzies. His experience, sage advice, and considered input has been greatly valued by the members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, particularly in his position as Human Rights Sub-Committee Chair. On behalf of the Committee, I wish him and his wife, Margie, all the best in retirement.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">During this inquiry, the Committee examined the effectiveness of Australian initiatives in the region, such as the Pacific Step-up program, as well as identified ways to improve Australia's engagement with its Pacific Island neighbours.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, it is my pleasure as the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to present the Committee's report on <span style="font-style:italic;">Expanding the membership of the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, the CPTPP, is an agreement between 11 economies, including Australia. The subject of the committee's inquiry was the agreement's expansion-that is, the case for new members to accede to the agreement. Sixty-eight submissions and eight public hearings later, the committee deliberated, and today I am delighted to be tabling a report that received bipartisan support in the joint standing committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The starting point is to recognise that the CPTPP is one of the world's most comprehensive free trade agreements. It follows, therefore, that the CPTPP's quality must be maintained. Indeed, it should be open for new members, but that welcome should not be unconditional. Put differently, the only aspiring economies that should be considered are those that (1) support an open, transparent and stable trading environment; (2) demonstrate an ability and willingness to meet the agreement's high standards; and (3) offer export potential through enhanced market access.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Tackling the question of future CPTPP members isn't an academic exercise. Indeed, the United Kingdom is well into the accession process as the first aspiring economy to formally request to join the agreement. As the committee has recognised, that process that the UK is undergoing should be leveraged as a template for other future aspiring economies. There are also lessons to be learnt from the UK experience. These are, firstly, the benefits that accrue from negotiating a bilateral free trade agreement with a trading partner while concurrently helping facilitate that same partner's accession to the CPTPP; secondly, the importance of government-to-government engagement during the accession process, including at the ministerial level; and, thirdly, the value of clear guidance on the accession process, including the various gates-the various stages-of the deal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When it came to the question of the UK's accession, the committee recommended that the Australian government work with its other CPTPP members to encourage and facilitate the UK's accession to the agreement. We made a similar recommendation on encouraging and facilitating the accession of South Korea, noting that South Korea is at a far earlier stage in the process than the UK, as it's only now in the midst of formalising its request to join the CPTPP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Taiwan, on the other hand, formalised its request to join the CPTPP some time ago. The committee's recommendation on Taiwan was that the Australian government work with other CPTPP members to encourage and facilitate its accession to the agreement. We also went one step further with respect to Taiwan. Australia does not have a bilateral free trade agreement with Taiwan. Noting the benefits that accrued from negotiating a bilateral free trade agreement with the United Kingdom while also supporting its accession to the CPTPP, the committee has recommended to the Australian government that it also consider adopting a similar approach with Taiwan-that is, negotiating a bilateral Taiwan-Australia free trade agreement while, concurrently, encouraging and facilitating its accession to the CPTPP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee recommended that the Australian government work with other CPTPP members to encourage China to re-establish full trading relations, ending its coercive trade measures and re-engaging in ministerial dialogue, and demonstrate an ability and willingness to commit to the CPTPP's high standards prior to supporting the commencement of an accession process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On other economies which have expressed an interest in the CPTPP without formalising a request to join, including Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, the committee recommended that the Australian government work with other CPTPP members to encourage ongoing informal discussions with these economies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Lastly, the committee also made a recommendation with respect to the United States, which was central to negotiations on the agreement before it withdrew. The committee recommended that the Australian government work with other CPTPP members to encourage the United States to renew its interest in the agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In closing, I thank the diplomatic representatives of the United Kingdom, China, and Taiwan for their submissions. I also thank all submitters and those who appeared before the committee in public hearings. I thank the committee secretariat; and the Chair of the Trade Sub-Committee, Mr Ted O'Brien.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, I thank all members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade from both the House of Representatives and the Senate, from both this side of the aisle, for their cooperation which led to the report I tabled today.</span>

The highway connects Sydney and Brisbane, and is a major contributor to Australia's economic activity. Since the commencement of the Pacific Highway upgrade in 1996, fatal crashes have more than halved, down from more than 40 per year prior to the upgrade commencing, to fewer than 20 in recent years. To support the safety improvements, time savings and reduction in noise and pollution to major towns, the Australian Government committed over $5.6 billion from 2013-14 towards the completion of the Pacific Highway upgrade.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Improving road safety is a national priority for the Australian Government, with responsibility shared across all jurisdictions and at all levels of government, including local government. The road transport industry is subject to the work health and safety (WHS) laws of each jurisdiction. The Australian Government works with states and territories through Safe Work Australia to encourage national consistency in WHS laws and to address WHS issues of national concern, including safety in the road transport industry. Heavy vehicles are regulated separately under the Heavy Vehicle National Law which applies nationally, except in Western Australia and the Northern Territory who have their own arrangements in place.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The establishment of an independent tribunal to address rates of pay and conditions in the road transport industry has been tried before with negative impacts on owner-drivers, small and family transport operators. The Australian Government abolished a similar body in 2016, the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal (RSRT), following two independent reviews and feedback from industry participants confirming that, while the aim of the RSRT was to improve safety, the use of financial incentives and strict regulation had significant unintended consequences on participants in the sector. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Economic analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers showed the RSRT's two remuneration orders would result in a net cost to the economy of $2.3 billion over 15 years with no tangible impact on road safety. It also found there was limited and contradictory evidence to show any relationship between safety and remuneration. </span>

The Australian Government believes investing in practical measures that support the industry's safe, sustainable and efficient operation, combined with the existing effective regulatory supports, is the best way to ensure the continued viability of the road transport industry. </span>

In reviewing a contract, a Court must only have regard to the terms of the contract when it was made and other matters at the time the contract was made. This may include the relative strengths of the parties to the contract and whether the contract provides total remuneration that is, or is likely to be, less than that of an employee performing similar work.

Regulators undertake proactive activities, such as education and awareness raising, as well as compliance activities which may include inspections, audits and other verification activities.

The Prime Minister, the Hon Scott Morrison MP, announced on 20 December 2021 that the Transport and Logistics IRC consulted industry stakeholders and recommended a potential apprenticeship pathway for heavy vehicle drivers. If adopted by state and territory governments, such a pathway could help to professionalise the road transport workforce, improve training completion rates, and increase safety standards and the appeal of the industry to younger workers.</span>

All jurisdictions except Victoria have adopted the model WHS laws. Western Australia has passed a new WHS Act based on the model WHS Act, which is expected to commence in 2022. These laws recognise that certain types of work can be hazardous and require specific skills, capabilities and licences to perform safely. Under the model WHS Regulations, a person must be at least 18 years old and hold the appropriate 'high risk work' licence before performing certain classes of work, except as part of supervised training. These classes are set out under Schedule 3 of the model WHS Regulations and include the operation of forklifts. In line with this, workers under 18 years old are currently prohibited under the model WHS laws from operating forklifts.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This instrument is a culmination of a policy announced almost four years ago, affectionately known as UNGI. We were told it was necessary to ensure stable energy supply, but all it's done is cause chaos and havoc with energy investors and halt new energy supply. Energy businesses held off on making their investment decisions for fear that the government was handing out to its preferred coal and gas donors and that they would not be able to compete with them. This isn't just rhetoric. The whole process from start to finish has been hidden from public view. There have been no grant criteria. There's just a slush fund for Minister Taylor to pick and choose which projects he wants to fund, and donors are encouraged to apply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the shortlist was announced around three years ago it included coal plants, five gas plants and six pumped hydro projects. The department were asked over and over again how they were going to legally fund it. They did not have a clear answer. Then they tried to use the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to spend this money by creating the Grid Reliability Fund. This was opposed by the Greens, Labor and the crossbench, and the government did not have the numbers. But it didn't even get to the Senate. When it was in the House a backbencher by the name of Barnaby Joyce moved an amendment to allow the CEFC to fund coal projects. The government killed that bill and UNGI died with it. But in the months that followed, legal counsel for the government obviously came across a new way to fund coal, oil and gas projects in section 33 of the Industry Research and Development Act that allows grants to be made by regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The entire Senate opposes this poor policy except for One Nation and the government. That isn't enough to pass a law to create this fund but it is enough to prevent a disallowance, because the onus is flipped so the government needs one fewer vote. That is why handout after handout for coal, oil and gas companies has been funnelled through this section of the industry act in recent months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scrutiny of regulations committee have serious concerns with this bill, as they did with the ARENA regulations, so these concerns should be carried through. The committee have asked Minister Taylor to respond to their concerns, and, a month on, he still hasn't written back to the committee with any justification. We may not be successful today but we will lodge a disallowance in the next parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lismore has been evacuated and flooded for the second time this month. Water has breached the levee, and insurers are telling us that these floods are set to be the most expensive natural disaster in Australia's history. On this same day, One Nation and the government are voting to hand out more handouts to gas companies that are owned by billionaires overseas and registered in tax havens—surprise, surprise! The gas companies should be paying to clean up the damage they are causing but instead they're getting away with our money to make floods even worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the government's best efforts they still couldn't get this money out the door for their coal donor Trevor St Baker, who bought Vales Point power station off the New South Wales Liberals for $1 million. It was actually worth $700 million the next year. Then a story leaked in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> that they were going to get $11 million for that. In estimates the department denied that this was true, so a cabinet minister must have leaked it. Thankfully, the UNGI scheme imploded, and they couldn't get the money out the door quickly enough. The Vales Point coal plant didn't get the money at the time they needed it, so they withdrew their application. Still, here we are, with one of the final acts of the 46th Parliament being to give more handouts to fossil fuel donors. The 47th Parliament cannot come quick enough for some of us.</span>

It lacks both transparency and integrity. It has given disgraced minister Angus Taylor a blank cheque to fund pet projects without due process. Industry and experts tell us that it will push up power prices and expose taxpayers to risky investments. The Business Council of Australia has also criticised the program, saying: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor very much shares all of those concerns.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 4 to the Bill makes it easier for businesses to create employee share schemes by reducing red tape. It reduces the regulatory requirements that apply to employee share schemes and the associated compliance burden.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 6 to the Bill delivers a one-off Cost Of Living Tax Offset to support low and middle income earners facing rising cost of living pressures. The Government is delivering this cost of living tax offset through the tax system by increasing the low and middle income tax offset by $420 for the 2021-22 income year. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The low and middle income tax offset is available to individuals with taxable incomes of less than $126,000, and currently provides a reduction in tax of up to $1,080.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Overall, the one-off cost of living tax offset will provide $4.1 billion in tax relief to low- and middle-income earners. This is on top of the $7.8 billion in tax relief that the Government delivered through the LMITO for the 2021-22 income year.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WATT:</span>
                    </a>  Fine. I will read them out. Labor will support these bills, including the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Support and Other Measures) Bill 2022. We are fully aware of the cost-of-living pressure being experienced by Australians, and our support for the measures in these bills reflects our commitment before last night's budget to be constructive about cost-of-living relief that the government brings forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were three defining features of last night's budget: firstly, $1 trillion in debt, with nowhere near enough to show for that incredibly significant addition of debt that has been put on the budget by those opposite; secondly, real wages falling in the budget, with the average worker being $26 a week or $1,315 a year worse off as a consequence of the real wage cuts which were outlined there in black and white in the government's budget last night; and, thirdly, buried on page 49 of Budget Paper No. 2, $3 billion in secret cuts that the government does not want to come clean on on this side of the election, no matter what government members may want to say about the budget papers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If there is a theme that emerges from this budget, it is that the government has taken a whole bunch of problems and challenges that exist on one side of the election and put them on the other side of the election. It's almost as if the Prime Minister woke up at some point in the last couple of weeks, contacted the Treasurer and said: 'I've got to call an election in the next fortnight or so. Let's get the shovel out, and hopefully we can shovel enough money in people's direction that they will forget that we've spent the best part of a decade going after the wages, job security, pensions and Medicare of ordinary Australians.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has gone after Australians for the best part of a decade, and it's hoping this cash splash will make Australians forget the damage that those opposite have done to Australians' living standards with this almost decade-long campaign of undermining job security, wages growth, the pension and Medicare. However, I think people are seeing through this budget, just as they're seeing through this government. They understand that, even after the relief which was budgeted for last night and which we're looking to pass through the parliament today, people are still way, way behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While it's true that there has been significant pressure put on the economy and on prices by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, prices didn't start skyrocketing and pressure didn't start being applied to working families when Russia invaded Ukraine. These things started when the coalition started attacking wages and living standards. Nothing in these bills before us today makes up for the damage that those opposite have done to household budgets. They said that stagnant wages were a deliberate design feature of their economic policy. In lots of ways, this is mission accomplished, because we have yet another year of real wages going backwards in the government's own budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have said consistently for some time is that we won't be standing in the way of some cost-of-living relief, which is made necessary by the government's attacks on wages and the fact that real wages are going backwards. We intend to support the bills which are before this house today and which cover the measures announced last night to provide some cost of living relief for Australians, particularly pensioners and workers on low and middle incomes—and also motorists, with the fuel excise cut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth mentioning, though—and it is consistent with what I was saying before about taking problems from one side of the election to the other—that what the government will be legislating today is an increase in petrol prices in September and the end of the low- and middle-income tax offset. So, if the government were to change hands in May, whether the election is on 14 or 21 or 7 May, the inheritance for a new government or, frankly, for a re-elected government would be $1 trillion of debt with nothing to show for it; interest rates going up, as the Reserve Bank and others have flagged; petrol prices going up in September; and the end of the low- and middle-income tax offset.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What was missing in this budget was a genuine plan for the future. At the upcoming election, Australians have a real choice. If we want to deal with the skills crisis by providing fee-free TAFE, if we want to reduce energy costs with cheaper and cleaner energy, if we want to increase workforce participation by boosting child care, if we want to modernise the NBN to increase productivity throughout the economy, and if we want to co-invest in advanced manufacturing to create new, secure jobs and new industries to build sovereign capability in Australia, then that's what an Albanese Labor government will deliver, and that's why Australians should vote for an Anthony Albanese Labor government at the coming election.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COX</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:20</span>):  I rise to make a contribution to this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Support and Other Measures) Bill 2022. This bill provides a one-off payment of $250 to income support recipients and also provides an income tax offset of $420 for the 2021-22 income year. The government is trying to pass off these sweeteners as cost-of-living payments that will ease the cost of living pressures. But Australians won't fall for that. The $420 payment won't go far enough, for families across Australia who are stuck spending half of their income on housing, and the $250 payment would only lift pensioners out of poverty for one week before sending them back below the poverty line the following week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot seriously be talking about easing the cost-of-living pressures without talking about housing. We are in a housing crisis in Australia; there are no two ways about that. Too many Australians are struggling to keep their heads above water, and too many of these Australians are women and younger people. Everyone deserves a roof over their heads and a safe place to call home. In a property market that is rigged for wealthy investors and with property prices surging to record highs, buying a home is well out of reach for most people. Decades of governments have rigged private housing markets with tax breaks to favour big developers and rich property speculators. We have a housing affordability crisis, but the Liberal and Labor parties want to wipe their hands of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It isn't good enough to just leave this to the market. To fix this mess, we actually need government action and we need it now. Renters in this country are doing it tough. It's too expensive for many people to pay rent and also save for a deposit at the same time. More and more people are renting, but with limited rights—and they can't turn their house into a home. Like so many others across this country I am a single parent, and I know what it's like to live in social housing. For people like us the housing crisis is not academic; it is our lived reality. And it's time to wake up, because that is what's happening in the real world. It's time to think differently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the balance of power, the Greens will push for billionaires and big corporations to actually pay their fair share of tax in this country so we can build affordable housing and tackle the housing crisis head-on. Whether you are renting a home or buying one, a housing system should work for people and not for profit. That's why the Greens will build one million new homes, including 120,000 new homes in my home state of Western Australia, over the next 20 years. These new homes will clear the public housing waiting list and make housing more affordable. They will end homelessness and ensure that everyone has a roof other their heads. We will build and offer—to renters, first home buyers and people locked out of housing—new, good-quality homes in areas people actually want to live in, for $300,000, at cost price. This means renters can become homeowners, paying off an affordable home loan—and building equity—rather than the ever-increasing rental payments. Because this means buying a home from the government, the price isn't set by property tycoons trying to turn a massive profit. The shared equity scheme will mean buyers will eventually own three-quarters of the property and be able to live there for the rest of their lives, or sell the property and move into the private property market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens will give renters the rights they deserve, by strengthening renters' rights and by funding tenancy advocacy services. That's why we will introduce rent control, ban no-grounds evictions and give the option of long-term leases for those who want them. Renters should be able to build the life they want in their home—I know you don't understand that, Senator Scarr—with the right to make minor changes without a landlord's permission. We will stop the blanket ban on pets in leases. We will again pay for this by making the billionaires pay the billionaires tax on their wealth and by winding back unfair tax breaks for people who own two or more properties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are the only party who don't take donations from the big banks, the big developers and the property tycoons. We are unlike the other parties, because we don't take big donations and we put people's needs first. The Liberal and Labor parties give billions of dollars in handouts to people who own multiple properties, which just pushes the prices up and locks people out of housing. Both of the major parties want to keep the system rigged for big banks, big developers and property tycoons—all of which donate huge amounts to their party each year. Both parties are beholden to their donors, and it shows. Their policies make it easier for someone to buy their third, fourth or fifth investment property. The Greens will make sure that those people who are locked out of the housing market can own their own home so that we can all have a safe place to call home.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHELDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:26</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Support and Other Measures) Bill 2022. Schedule 6 includes a one-off $420 pre-election bribe for individuals with a taxable income of less than $126,000. Schedule 8 of this bill includes a one-off $420 pre-election bribe for recipients of social security and veteran payments and for holders of certain concession cards. I say these are bribes because there is no real plan to turn around and deal with the cost of living. You purely turn around and do the important immediate steps of trying to pretend you're dealing with the cost of living. You don't have a plan for the future. You didn't have a plan before these one-off payments. There is nothing in this bill or elsewhere in the budget that grows wages. There is nothing in this bill or elsewhere in the budget to improve job security, which assists in growing wages. There is no long-term plan in this bill or elsewhere to improve the standard of living for Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This leads me to ask: why are the Prime Minister and the rest of this sorry government so desperate to hold onto power if, when they have power, they don't even try to improve the lives of everyday Australians? Isn't that why we're all here? Australians are being crushed by cost-of-living pressures. We're seeing skyrocketing costs of living and record low wages growth. Of course, they're also being crushed by record levels of high job insecurity. That's the track record of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I listened earlier today, in question time, with some amusement to Senator Birmingham say, 'We have a long-term economic plan.' Guess what? Their long-term economic plan is to decrease your wages as part of an economic design they have put in place to keep wages low. To keep the standard of living low in this country is a design practice of this government. What does that mean for everyday Australians and what does that mean for Australia? It means middle-class jobs are disappearing. It means that, for the first time in the history of this country, this government has been shrinking the middle class. They have not put the plans and processes in place to make sure there is a real difference. There are so many examples of that. People are desperately suffering under this government's watch and under this government's program to make sure that people are not on a liveable wage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As recently as 23 March this year, it was reported that new modelling shows that an aged-care worker with no partner or dependants has $112 a week left after covering the costs of rent, transport, groceries and health care. If the worker is a single parent, they are $148 behind. About 70 per cent of aged-care staff are qualified personal care workers with a certificate III qualification, and, after tax, they take home $770 a week. Those figures are for a feminised industry—the caring industry, which is so critical to our community and also to our economy. The Australian Aged Care Collaboration, which is a group of six aged-care peak bodies, examined the rising costs of living for affected workers, and that's what they found. This is not some propaganda sheet from some obscure source; this is the employers saying how desperate the situation is for the workers within their industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, you can go into so many more examples of what's occurring in our economy right now. I recall that, when I first started working as a cleaner and then a bar attendant as a full-time job in my late teens, I was working with people who were raising a family. For me, a middle-class job is when you have middle-class pay, and people in those jobs as cleaners and bar attendants were raising families. These days they're still middle-class jobs, but they don't have middle-class pay. They don't have a government that cares about expanding, developing and supporting the middle class in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regardless of the rhetoric, let's look at the actual facts. The McKell Institute found that an average worker would be earning $307 more per week if the wages growth achieved under Labor between 2007 and 2013 had been sustained from 2014 to 2021. Almost $16,000 per year has been stolen from everyday Australian workers under this government's watch because they have a low-wage agenda. And, when you look at the low-wage agenda, how low can they go? How far can we turn it around and make sure that workers don't have the opportunities that they should have to earn a decent living? We only have to turn to comments that have been passed regarding workers in what is now our second-largest company, Uber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 120,000 people working for Uber. Thank goodness they have been working, because they were on the front line of the pandemic. But what's their income? Their income is as low as $6.67 an hour. They have no worker's comp and no right to bargain. Wait a second! I did hear from the industrial relations minister, who said she supports giving gig workers 'the freedom and flexibility to enter into contracts and negotiate their own rates of pay'. It sounds like digital WorkChoices, doesn't it? It sounds like digital WorkChoices as a design of this government. The person in charge of workplace laws in Australia thinks that an Uber driver getting paid $6.67 an hour can negotiate with the CEO in San Francisco to try to get a decent wage. The consequences are in black and white, from inquiry after inquiry, in report after report. An inquiry into job security went right to the heart of this issue of low wages. Uber drivers cannot negotiate their wages. But, for this government, it's too complicated to give basic rights to a fellow worker who is working in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that this doesn't apply to everybody on the other side of this chamber, but it must apply to the people who cop the consequences of what you're doing. When you have industries—whether it be the ag industry, with exploited workers from the Pacific who are doing vital work in this country—where workers are getting as little in take-home pay as $100 a week, when you have Uber drivers getting paid $6.67 an hour and when you have industries that are dominated by people on temporary visas, particularly those where roughly 25 per cent are Australian nationals, it then starts to say that the government doesn't care. It doesn't care about the most vulnerable people within our community. What's clear from the McKell report is that it doesn't care about everyone else who is left, because it is a design practice of this government to turn around and keep our wages low right across the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll let you into a little secret: a good economy doesn't create good jobs; good jobs create a good economy. And a good job is a secure job, where you're able to negotiate a decent wage. This government has said quite clearly, quite directly that, as a matter of policy, low wages are a fundamental ambition that it has. Congratulations! You've achieved that.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:35</span>):  Once again, I've had the privilege of sitting in the chamber as Senator Cox has made a contribution where the Greens have referred to this concept of power sharing. In the event that the Labor Party win the next election, the Greens are all set up. They're mobilised. They're going to share power with the Labor Party. They're going to share power with you, Senator Ciccone and Senator Watt. They're ready. It's going to be delightful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Watt, you've got such mastery, in terms of negotiation skills. I can see you there. I don't know—are you going to play bad cop or good cop with Senator Ciccone? Senator Ciccone, I think you'll be the good cop. I think Senator Watt is the bad cop.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator SCARR:</span>
                    </a>  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I do believe that Senator Ciccone would make a good cop, but I think, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that he could turn and become a bad cop, and maybe you'll need to use negotiating tactics like this, in terms of your power-sharing arrangement with the Greens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we heard it again this afternoon. We heard it again today from Senator Cox, with her housing policy straight out of the 1940s. Did rent control work in Great Britain? No. Did they abolish it because it didn't work? Yes. Does rent control work in the state of New York? No. Did rent control work in the state of Victoria in the 1940s, during the Second World War and in its aftermath? No. What did rent control lead to? It led to a lack of private dwellings available for rent, because landlords wouldn't invest in them. And they didn't invest in any maintenance of the buildings that they built, because there was rent control. Then, people who had excess capacity, in terms of accommodation, didn't rent it out because they wouldn't have gotten sufficient rent. It was an absolutely disastrous policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I can see Senator Watt and Senator Ciccone spending time, in terms of sharing the power with the Greens, having these debates. I've got some literature upstairs. I've got a book called <span style="font-style:italic;">Basic Economics</span>, which I'll lend you. It has a whole chapter on rent control. It's an introductory text for economics 101, so I'll lend that to you, Senator Ciccone. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I will lend it to my good friends opposite for when they're engaged in their power-sharing arrangements with the Australian Greens. It's going to be delightful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must say that Senator Watt is a person of great humour. From time to time I chuckle at his contributions. Sometimes I can't be too open about it, but I do chuckle from time to time. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I just wonder how long Senator Watt's good humour is going to last. But, through you Mr Acting Deputy President, whatever happens, my door is always open to Senator Watt and to my good friend Senator Ciccone, if they need some counselling. I've been through difficult negotiations during my corporate career, and if they need some counselling at any time in relation to the negotiation, I've got a book in my library called <span style="font-style:italic;">How to </span><span style="font-style:italic;">D</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eal with Difficult People</span>. I'm prepared to lend you that book—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:</span>  Senator Scarr, this is a very generous contribution, but I do start to fail to see its relevance to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Support and Other Measures) Bill 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282997" type="MemberContinuation">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator SCARR:</span>
                    </a>  I thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, for bringing me back to the topic. You are, in fact, right: I have been thinking aloud in relation to the power sharing, so I will come back to the cost of living. I'm delighted to do so after the budget that was brought down, because there are cost-of-living measures in the budget that was brought down which will make a substantial difference to the good people of Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of the budget that was brought down earlier this week, for the next six months Australians will save 22c a litre every time they fill up their motor vehicle. That makes an outstanding contribution. It is money in the pockets for Queenslanders, a direct contribution for Queenslanders to handle those cost-of-living pressures. And it's fit and proper that, with the international situation as it is, this budget should have cost-of-living measures to provide some assistance to the good people of Queensland and the good people in South Australia, who you represent, Mr Acting Deputy President Fawcett. These are cost-of-living contributions to assist our constituents, to assist the people of Australia, in relation to the increase in oil prices which arose as a direct result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. So there's cost-of-living measure No. 1.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's estimated that a family with two cars they fill up once a week could save around $30 a week or around $700 over the next six months—a profound difference in cost of living for those people who need to fill up, who have a family and who have two cars. But there is also a cost-of-living tax offset, which I'm sure Senator Patrick would be interested in. This cost-of-living tax offset provides a new one-off $420 cost-of-living tax offset for more than 10 million low- and middle-income earners. Senator Sheldon in his contribution talked about those middle-income earners and said, 'Where's the plan?' Here's the plan: a $420 cost-of-living tax offset for more than 10 million low- and middle-income earners. The punters, the people out there, are not interested in wild and woolly rhetoric, theoretical plans et cetera. They want to know what it means to their basic living expenses. What does it mean? What does the budget mean as they try to balance their household budgets and provide for their families? That's what they want to know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Sheldon can talk about the issues in relation to whether a good economy creates good jobs or good jobs create a good economy. I'm not sure that the constituents I speak to in the region where I'm based—the Ipswich regional council area in the good state of Queensland—are interested in those debates. I think they are more interested in what it means for their wallets. What does the budget mean for their wallets in terms of practically managing the cost of living?</span>

                    </a>  In addition to those cost-of-living benefits, there's also, of course, the new one-off $250 cost-of-living payment, delivered within weeks to six million Australians. Pensioners, carers, veterans, jobseekers, eligible self-funded retirees and concession card holders will benefit. Together with existing indexation arrangements, this will see a single pensioner receive more than $500 in additional support over the next six months, just when they need it most. How's that for a plan? It sounds like a pretty good plan to me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason this government can deliver the cost-of-living relief is the responsible way in which this government has managed the budget through one of the most challenging times ever seen by this country. That's why we can deliver this cost-of-living relief to the good constituents of South Australia, who you represent, Mr Acting Deputy President Fawcett, and to the good constituents of Queensland, who I represent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, whilst relieving those cost-of-living pressures, we're also assisting the people of Australia with fulfilling their long-term plan—if we want to talk about plans—to buy a house, because that's the Australian dream. That's the Australia I grew up in: that everyone in this country should have the opportunity, if they work hard and put the effort in, to realise that dream of buying their first home. And this government has delivered in spades in relation to that objective. Over the last year 160,000 Australians have purchased their first home. That is a terrific record of achievement by this government. We're doubling the home guarantee scheme to 50,000 places per year. Approximately 10,000 Queenslanders have benefited from that home guarantee scheme—10,000 Queenslanders in their homes, no doubt listening to their senator from Queensland making a contribution to this debate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="266499" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUME</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Superannuation, Financial Services and the Digital Economy and Minister for Women</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">'</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">s Economic Security</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:46</span>):  I thank senators for their contributions to the debate today. The bill before us, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Support and Other Measures) Bill 2022, outlines a number of cost-of-living measures that were announced in last night's budget, delivered by the Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, in the other place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of the schedules in the bill include things like: making sure that the Medicare low-income thresholds keep pace with the cost of living; making COVID testing expenses tax-deductible for workers who require testing to attend work; and making it easier for businesses to create employee share schemes, giving more Australians opportunities to share in the economic value that they create through their work. The bill reduces the GDP uplift for GST instalments, saving businesses money. It includes the one-off cost-of-living tax offset, to support low- and middle-income earners, of $420 for the 2021-22 financial year. It increases the low- and middle-income tax offset benefit to $1,500 for singles or $3,000 for couples, provided on assessment of a tax return for this 2021-22 income year. It also increases the affordability of drugs that are on the PBS. In fact, 2,800 new drugs have been listed on the PBS since 2013, when the coalition came to government. It introduces a cost-of-living payment of $250 to pensioners, veterans, carers, jobseekers, concession card holders and eligible self-funded retirees. And, of course, it cuts the excise on petrol by half for the next six months. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the cost-of-living measures that we have promised in the budget. They are helping to ease the cost-of-living pressures on ordinary Australians now—cost-of-living pressures that have been caused by the invasion of Ukraine by Russia but also by the global supply chain issues that are a response to COVID-19.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More importantly, the budget last night did not just deal with cost-of-living pressures but also cemented our long-term economic plan that creates more jobs for Australians: lowering taxes; cutting red tape; investing in infrastructure and skills for a future workforce; keeping energy prices low—about eight per cent lower in the last two years alone—while at the same time ensuring that we continue on the journey to net zero by 2050; making Australia a leading, top-10 digital economy and society by 2030; and increasing our sovereign capabilities in modern manufacturing in areas like space, defence, food and beverages, and critical minerals and mining technology. That is the plan for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly, though, this bill is about reducing the cost of living, right now. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in a situation where we have floods in New South Wales and Queensland. We have a housing crisis. People can't make ends meet. Young people are burdened with huge study debts which are holding them back. Rather than addressing these issues that affect millions of people, here we have a government trying to sneak in deductible gift status for the Ramsay Centre for Western Civilisation—a move that will allow the centre to avoid taxation on their income. My amendment will stop this from happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot allow the Ramsay Centre for Western Civilisation to further cement its influence in our universities, on our students and in the curriculum. The Ramsay centre wants nothing more than to churn out students with an uncritical view of Western civilisation, and the government knows that. It's not as if university curricula across the country have any dearth of material that they already teach about Western civilisation. No university curriculum is even remotely lacking in Western history, literature or politics. All the Ramsay centre wants is to glorify Western civilisation, with as much influence as possible from their Howard and Abbott led vote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is shameful that the government wants to aid the Ramsay centre's project to airbrush imperialism and colonialism out of Western civilisation studies. This centre is about nothing but an aggressive and extremely political right-wing agenda. Let's not forget that Tony Abbott said, 'This centre isn't about Western civilisation; it's in favour of it.' We must push back hard against this idea of cultural supremacy and stand strongly for academic freedom and critical thinking. I urge my colleagues in the chamber to support my amendments.</span>

Putting aside the fact that Western civilisation is the foundation of the liberal democracy that we enjoy in Australia and is also the foundation of a parliamentary democracy that we enjoy right in this very chamber, I think the senator has misunderstood what DGR status actually implies. It does not mean that the Ramsay centre doesn't pay tax; it means that donors to the Ramsay centre are allowed to deduct their donations. I'm not entirely sure that's clear. Obviously, the government will be opposing these amendments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:02</span>):  In the interest of time, I won't make any extended remarks; I'll just refer people to the second reading speech I gave for the previous bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Support and Other Measures) Bill 2022. The sentiments that we expressed in that speech apply here as well. We fully support providing Australians with cost-of-living relief. It's a shame that it's taken this government so long to recognise that people have needed cost-of-living support, it's a shame that it took an impending election before the government delivered cost-of-living support and, of course, it leaves unresolved the matter of wages stagnating under this government, but we are fully supportive of providing the cost-of-living support that these bills, the Excise Tariff Amendment (Cost of Living Support) Bill 2022 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Cost of Living Support) Bill 2022, seek to provide.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate and Australian Greens </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:03</span>):  I'll also be relatively brief, but I want to reflect on the fact that the opening of the Treasurer's budget speech last night was very grave. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… as we gather, war rages in Europe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The global pandemic is not over.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Devastating floods have battered our communities. We live in uncertain times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, this parliament and parliaments and governments around the world are faced with these weighty issues—to which he could have added that we are living in an era when the planet's climate is breaking down around us. Yet, having set out in these Churchillian tones, the Treasurer proceeded to introduce a budget that, instead of rising to the gravity of the times and to the gravity of his opening remarks, is designed to do nothing more than get the government through to polling day in just a few short weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget confirms that this government is completely devoid of a moral compass, 100 per cent transactional, politically and electorally desperate, and cynical to its core. The budget is nothing more than a money-for-votes pitch. Sure, people will be happy to see an extra $250 or $420 in their wallets or their tax returns, but, individually and as a nation, we'd be much better off if we had a government that actually addressed the weighty issues of our time and went about ensuring access to reliable, affordable and high-quality essential public services so that, in a country as wealthy, safe and prosperous as ours, no-one would actually need budget handouts on budget night just to help them pay next week's bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'd also be much better off if we had a government which hadn't actively campaigned—as this government did in the last election—against the transition to electric vehicles. We all remember Mr Morrison three years ago doing his Chicken Little routine about electric vehicles being the end of the weekend. Well, how's the Prime Minister's weekend looking now? What's his solution? We've got a six-month cut to the fuel excise proposed in this legislation, the Excise Tariff Amendment (Cost of Living Support) Bill 2022 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Cost of Living Support) Bill 2022. That could easily be wiped out overnight, before it even gets to the petrol pump, by a spike in global commodity prices and the endlessly voracious profit gouging of multinational oil and gas companies—who, let's not forget, have obscenely profited by contributing so massively to the breakdown of our climate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we've got temporary cash payments and a temporary cut to the fuel excise. They both highlight that this government has no plan and no interest in addressing the fundamental cost-of-living pressures that people around the country are facing. Even with the temporary relief—and it's very temporary—that is offered by this budget, rents will still be going up thanks to this government giving $13 billion of tax breaks to property speculators in this budget so they can buy their third, fourth, fifth, 10th, 20th or 50th investment property. These tax breaks have turned what used to be regarded as homes for people into just another investment class. We will see medical expenses still going up, because this government is more interested in subsidising the profits of the private health corporations than it is in running a world-class public health system. We will see young people continuing to be priced out of a turbocharged housing market that is significantly increasing pressure on rents and pricing many people out of the rental market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Young people will also still be saddled with crippling levels of student budget. In this budget another $9 billion is added to the student debt in this country, thanks to a government made up of ministers who almost without exception got free university back in the day. We should be abolishing student debt in this country. That's what we should be doing, and we can afford it easily by making the big corporations and the billionaires pay their fair share of tax and ending the $10 billion that we see going every single year, including in the four out-years of this budget, to direct public subsidies to burn fossil fuels. House insurance will continue to go up thanks to this government doing nothing to prepare cities and towns for the impact of climate change, whether that be floods, sea level rise or bushfires.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, what do we get in this budget? Confirmation that the millionaires and billionaires can look forward to a $9,000-a-year leg-up when the stage 3 tax cuts come into place. This is a budget where there are tiny cash handouts for people who are struggling to make ends meet. The $250 for people on business will lift a group of people out of poverty for two weeks and then plunge them straight back into poverty. Meanwhile, the billionaires get a $9,000-a-year tax cut in perpetuity. It's an utter, utter disgrace. For the rich and powerful, the billionaires, the big corporates—the planet cookers—the handouts in this budget are massive, just like they are in every budget each and every year that this government has been here. I will never forget—and I will never stop reminding the Senate of it—that the Prime Minister once infamously said: 'This government looks after its mates.' So it has in this budget, because this is a government of its mates, by its mates and for its mates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The good news is that this country is less than 50 days away from kicking them out. We're going to see the back of this government that doesn't even believe in being a government. I genuinely hope that, when this parliament next convenes, we will have more Greens here in the Senate, and I believe we will, and that we will have more Greens in the House of Representatives as well, and I believe that we will. We actually have a positive vision for this country. With more Greens and with the Greens in the balance of power in the House of Representatives and the Senate, we can build more affordable housing; we can get rid of negative gearing and the capital gains tax concession; we can give people who are renting proper rights, so we can address the housing crisis head-on; we can get dental and mental health into Medicare; we can abolish student debt; we can keep coal and gas in the ground; we can restore a price on carbon pollution; we can protect the beautiful environment and the magnificent nature of this country; we can drive investment in clean energy; and we can make Australia a renewable energy superpower.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to do those things because, as the Treasurer said at the start of his budget speech, we are living in very challenging times. Our climate is breaking down around us. Economic inequality has been turbocharged. We are living through the sixth mass extinction event in the history of this planet. We need to take action to address those things. The budget did not take the necessary action, and that is because it is nothing other than a panicked scam—a desperate and cynical attempt to buy this government's way back into power. But what lets me sleep at night is that I know it's not going to work. I know it's not going to work because it is time that the Liberals are kicked out, and I genuinely believe the Australian people will do it this time around.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope the Australian people put the Greens in the balance of power in the Senate and in the House of Representatives so we can push the next government to go further and faster on those significant public policy areas that are the cause of some of the great challenges of our time.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUGHES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:13</span>):  I rise to speak on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Cost of Living Support) Bill 2022 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Cost of Living Support) Bill 2022. Senator McKim has actually started the theme that I wanted to talk about tonight. It was in this place only last night that Greens Senator Faruqi made the comment:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Greens in the balance of power will push the next government to move further and faster to tackle the climate crisis, to end coal and gas, to do more on mitigation and resilience, and to protect people and the planet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know about everybody else, but that sounds like a done deal to me. Obviously those opposite and those at the end of the chamber have already got into bed together. They're already lining up to destroy industries, to destroy jobs, to turn the lights off and to kill regions like the Hunter. What else would we expect from a party that has the member for Shortland, who is from the very far Left of the Labor Party, busy hugging snowmen at COP26 whilst he's trying to shut down the industry that his entire electorate is based on?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is absolutely appalling, and it is exactly why a Labor-Greens alliance is the most dangerous thing facing this country. And, if Senator Faruqi hadn't said it last night, we've just heard it said again by Senator McKim: with the balance of power and their Labor mates—already locked and loaded—they're going to shut down every coalmine, shut down every power station and kill off jobs. I'm off to the Hunter on Sunday and I'm now very much looking forward, even more than usual, to catching up with those industries—the defence industry that is absolutely striving to support our nation and the makers of the lithium-ion batteries being produced up in the Hunter. I'm looking forward to going to see the coalminers and the Newcastle ports—industries that sustain the entire Hunter region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At one point in time the Labor Party purported to be the party of workers. Well, we know that's gone. And we're going to lose the member for Hunter. It's like the last great hope as Mr Fitzgibbon leaves the Labor Party, because at least he got it. We've lost Senator Kitching; she got it. The Otis group seems to be a bit quiet at the moment. Maybe they can't get a booking, or maybe they've stopped stocking Godfather Too, so Senator Farrell won't go any more! But we very much look forward, hopefully in the coming weeks, to hearing from the Otis group—giving us some solace at some point—that coal is important to Australia, that energy production and fuel are important to Australia and that gas production is important to Australia. If you don't get that already, just go and have a look at what's happening in the Ukraine and Europe at the moment. It is absolutely irresponsible to suggest otherwise. We expect that from the Greens. We know that from the Greens. To their bed buddies who are all lined up with their power-sharing agreement, the Albanese-Bandt government: we know what's coming and we know how many jobs are going to be lost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People are experiencing incredible hardship after COVID. That is coming out of an incredibly strong economy bounce-back, better than almost anywhere in the world, with a AAA credit rating. But people are still doing it tough. We know there are cost-of-living pressures, because we all do actually live in the real world. We actually do go in and turn our lights on and appreciate where that power comes from. But we know that Australians, real Australians, are experiencing cost-of-living pressures. And, again—here's a little bit of intellectual depth that we know is lacking around most of this chamber on the other side—a lot of those cost-of-living pressures are actually created by international factors. We've had supply chain issues because we can't get the ships and the planes, that used to bring so many goods into and out of our country, to travel. We've got the fuel issue being driven by the war in Ukraine. These are international levers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we as a government have taken responsible action in supporting everyday Australians by putting more money into their pockets. We know that when you have a job, it's the best thing that can happen for you. It's good for your confidence, it's good for your self-esteem and it's great for your kids to see it. We don't want to see a consistent welfare state. We don't want to see people on a lifetime cycle of welfare. We know that senators sitting over there want a living wage. We haven't heard what's coming from those on the other side. Are they backing a living wage too—backing a living wage so that we don't have people in work? But when people are in work we trust them to keep more of their own money, because we know they can spend it the way they want to spend it. They can invest in their family and spend the money they earn much more efficiently than a group, a gaggle, a pair of bed partners that want to shut down entire industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we've all heard it today. We know it's all happening. The Australian public deserve to know what alliance you have set up, between the Labor Party and the Greens, what sort of backroom, secret, dodgy deals you're doing—I don't know, have you got a movie theme for that one as well? The Australian people deserve to know just how and when and how quickly—if you were to form government—you would kill off their jobs. That hubris is sneaking back in. We all remember the 'we're ready' photo. I'm really looking forward to the next one; I think it will be a cracker. And I'm sure we're going to have to have Mr Bandt in that one because Mr Bandt is ready as well, to get into that power-sharing agreement. I think you might all find in a couple of months that Australians are going to understand that this government has taken them through COVID, has saved their jobs and has kept the economy strong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing debt being repaid at a much faster rate, and one of the reasons for that—which you might enjoy, Senator McKim—is the unbelievable commodity prices at the moment: iron ore, coal, thermal coal—love it!—and gas. Those commodity prices are what are going to bring the deficit down. But because some of us actually did pay attention in economics, we understand that. I think the Australian people are going to see it because they do not want a bunch of economic illiterates who want to cut their jobs off and who bully their colleagues but don't look into that whilst jumping up and down hypocritically. It's absolutely appalling and the Australian people deserve to know exactly what sneaky deals you guys have done.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHELDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  I rise to speak on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Cost of Living Support) Bill 2022 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Cost of Living Support) Bill 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government is defeated in May, its parting gift to all Australians is an increase in petrol prices in September and, of course, not keeping up with prices, a trillion dollars in debt and rising interest rates. Under this government we could see petrol prices and cost of living skyrocketing, and we're going to see working families falling further behind. We should also consider that before the Ukrainian-Russian war, before all the horrors that have been occurring in Ukraine, petrol prices were going up under this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we start looking at dealing with the cost of living, particularly with the fuel excise, we start looking at my old industry, which I'll get to in a moment—the old transport industry, which I still take a deep interest in. There are some great companies, some wonderful owner-drivers and great employees which make that industry. Of course, I'm proud to say, as a union official, that I also represented the largest small-business organisation in this country: the Transport Workers Union. They represent many, many thousands of owner-drivers across this economy. In actual fact I think it's the largest small-business organisation, even when you put all the other groups together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What really strikes me when we start looking at what this excise tariff means for those drivers is that it costs $1,000 to fill up their tank and that the money they'll get back, approximately, is $88. That's $1,000 to fill their tank and they'll only get $88. How has this government helped the cost of living for small business? Firstly, they got rid of the right for owner-drivers to negotiate collectively for agreements—that was only a number of years ago under this government. Then they said they would put something in place to make sure that there wasn't devastation across the industry. Of course—surprise, surprise!—nothing has been put in place at all to effectively give rights back to those owner-drivers, those small-business people, which were stolen by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's particularly galling when we start looking at the exploitation that's happening in that cost-of-living question for owner-drivers as small-business people is the consequences of the death and injury rates. When you're in a supply chain—and this is a bit of a lesson for them—you have the employer at the top, reaping all the benefit and contracting out, contracting out and contracting out what is fundamentally the same work. The people at the bottom, who are often those hardworking owner-drivers, are the ones who are forced to take the price they're given. They're not price-makers; they're price-takers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the exact same thing when you look at Uber, when you look at the gig economy in transport. These people, these hard workers, are not price-makers; they're price-takers. They don't have the capacity to bargain collectively. And what are the consequences? Five people dead across the eastern seaboard from delivering food. And those are the ones which have been reported. In further reports as a result of forensic pursuit by the Labor Party in New South Wales, there were hundreds upon hundreds of injured workers each year who were not identified to WorkCover in New South Wales. So there are hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of serious injuries across the gig industry in food delivery for one company, Uber—the one they defend, because, don't forget, they reckon that those Uber workers can negotiate. If they don't like it, they can just take their labour somewhere else. When you've only got the option of starvation wages and starvation, then you take starvation wages. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government simply and fundamentally does not care. For those who do care, there is a solution. For those who are in this chamber, in the Senate, there are solutions. The solution isn't $88 to those owner-drivers; the solution is about having a plan, not a one-off payment. It isn't necessary for us to turn around and: make sure that we have proper regulation to equalise bargaining rights between employers and those supply chains; make sure we deal with the cost-of-living pressures; make sure that we actually have a plan to make sure small businesses aren't being done over; and make sure those people who are in the most exploited industries have rights, the rights that we all enjoy, because we actually don't have the will to turn around and give legislative protections. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government needs to turn around and decide that the Oliver Twist approach to wages is no policy at all—going to the governor with your bowl and saying, 'Please, can I have some more?' Surprise, surprise, the governor says, 'No.' And what do you do? You go back to your seat. Well, that's not the sort of country that we should have here. We should have rights for working people to be able to argue for decent wages. This is not an anti-company position; it's actually supporting good business. Because there are lots of good businesses out there, including in the gig industry, that want further regulation; however, they can't do it unless there's proper competition, proper regulation and fairness in the market. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Oliver Twist approach by this government just does not work. As recently as 22 March, Ben Butler in a report—and this was reported in a number of other places as well—on the Reserve Bank said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="background-color:#FFFFFF;">Real wages have been stagnant in Australia for almost a decade, frustrating Lowe, who said he would 'like to see some bigger increases'.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And what's the government's plan for that? No plan. No strategy. No way to make sure the middle-class are putting workers, small-business people and its employees in jobs that are vital. All they can think of is: 'Gee, I tell you what: wages are really going up for the executives in those finance companies. They're really going up for some sections of the market. They're really going up for that top one per cent, but they are not going up for everybody else across this economy.' They've got more job insecurity, they've got lower wages and, under this government's plan, they'll have even lower wages. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="237920" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STOKER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Attorney-General, Assistant Minister for Women and Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:28</span>):  I rise to speak to the Excise Tariff Amendment (Cost of Living Support) Bill 2022 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Cost of Living Support) Bill 2022. Of course they form part of the federal government's budget delivered yesterday by Mr Frydenberg.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget does something very important for all Australians. It acknowledges the challenges that households are facing right now as our market adapts to many of the challenges that have put inflationary pressures on prices, the concerns emerging from Europe and the Ukraine, and the impact on fuel prices. The impact on the cost of transport and its impact on groceries and household bills is something that we acknowledge in this budget, something that we empathise with and something that we understand. There is action to reduce the cost of living now, whether one looks to the cost of fuel—which, by halving the fuel excise for the next six months, means a household with two cars that fill up once a week will find themselves around $700 better off during that period—or whether it's about the cost-of-living tax offset—$420 that means more than 10 million low- and middle-income earners in this country will find themselves better able to cope with those increased costs of living. We'll have pensioners, carers, veterans, jobseekers and eligible self-funded retirees and concession card holders better equipped to handle the price fluctuations we have seen due to that international change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also taking important steps to make sure that more Australians can afford the cost of a home. We know and we understand just how important that ambition of Australians to be able to save for and get into a home of their very own is, including ensuring that that's not something that's out of reach for people who are single parents. We're more than doubling the home guarantee scheme to 50,000 places per year, knowing that the enthusiasm for this program in its early years has been through the roof. Helping more Australians get into their own home, get out of the cycle of renting and own their own little piece of Australia is a big part of how we are showing that we understand the pressures that are on people to manage those cost-of-living pressures every day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we're not just dealing with the here and now. We also have in this budget a long-term plan that is about building the kind of strength in this economy that delivers job and wage growth for the long term, and that is something every Australian benefits from. With $2.8 billion invested to increase the take-up and completion rates of apprentices, we will see more skilled people in the workforce. There will be 800,000 people supported into training places as a part of this budget. With support for small businesses to get supersized tax deductions for every dollar they're prepared to spend investing in the skill sets and training of their employees—investing in the software, the technical and electronic infrastructure needed to improve productivity, to improve cybersecurity and to improve efficiency of their business—they can get benefits of up to $100,000 a year per business if they are prepared to double down on their investment in the jobs of their team, in the growth and in the contribution that they make to our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're investing hard in local manufacturing. Of course, we've made enormous progress in developing the kind of specialised and high-skill manufacturing in Australia that remains an area in which we can be very competitive despite the comparatively high labour costs that we have in Australia. It is going from strength to strength. With support for greater commercialisation of the research that is being done in enormous quantities, particularly in partnership between our universities, the CSIRO and industry, we are driving the commercialisation and the manufacture of new technologies, whether those are in energy, medical supplies, defence or other high-priority areas for this country. Importantly, agriculture and energy are core to this manufacturing strategy. It's all about making sure there is a steady stream of high-value intellectual property developed here in Australia so that income from new patents developed here can be taxed at almost half the rate that ordinarily applies. That means this country will become a really attractive destination for people to set up shop, do their research and development and forge a manufacturing enterprise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our regions are a big part of the story of the coalition government's vision for the future growth of our economy. Investment in our regions is how we ensure that we give great opportunities to people who live outside our cities, who we know ordinarily have fewer opportunities from which to choose. It is how we harness the enormous gift that we have in the size and richness of the mineral and land wealth of this country. And it is how we ensure that people, no matter where they live in this great country, can have not only the same aspiration to have a great job and afford a home they can be proud of but also the expectation of high-quality services. By building the wealth of this nation, by harnessing both the human talents and the natural talents of our regions, we can make sure that there is opportunity for all in this country from the strength of our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this makes possible something that is really important, and that's our safety net. We're able to guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on because of the strength of our vision for our nation's economy for the long term. Of course, we have guaranteed Medicare. We have funded our health system at increasing levels every year under our government so that now health spending is at a record high. In last year's budget there was a landmark $2.3 billion investment in the mental health of Australians and in suicide prevention, and in this budget we have built on that commitment further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard today in the debate on the Women's Budget Statement just how much the prosperity, the safety, the health and wellbeing, and the leadership of Australian women is vital to this economic story. That is something the women of this country, who now face almost the lowest gender pay gap ever and the highest workforce participation they have ever seen, are benefiting from now. And the families of this country will continue to benefit, with more support for child care and more flexibility in paid parental leave than we have seen in the past.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I could keep going but I think the point is clear: we are able to guarantee the essential services that Australians depend on because we have a strong plan for our economy to deliver opportunity for all. What that means is fewer Australians who need our support in welfare. Those very same people are not just getting the dignity of a job, not just getting the pride, the skills and the camaraderie that comes from having work to go to every day; they also become contributors to this country in the sense of making contributions to the tax system. They are net givers rather than takers. That is what we need to make sure we can guarantee the essential services on which Australians rely for the very, very long term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, this budget makes it possible for us to make a record investment in the security of this country. As we face a less certain world, as we observe geopolitical tensions in Europe and elsewhere, it is more important than ever that we invest in the good men and women of our defence forces, that we grow our capability to protect our shores and that we prepare our cybersecurity in both the governmental and defence senses but also to assist industries to cope with changing dynamics on that front. Our cybersecurity investment in this budget puts us on a robust footing in this new frontier for international conflict.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it's in that context that I look with great optimism to what is ahead for Australia. These bills play such an important part in realising that vision, delivered so well by Treasurer Frydenberg yesterday. We look forward to not just sharing it with the Australian people in the days and weeks ahead but delivering it—delivering it today, tomorrow, next week, next month and for the years and decades ahead.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill modernises and streamlines social security law to support a new employment services model, which will change the way that employment services are delivered from 1 July 2022. The new model offers job seekers who are more job-ready the opportunity to self-manage their pathway to work using a digital platform, while providing more intensive, tailored face-to-face support for those who need or want it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new model builds on evidence from the New Employment Services Trial and Online Employment Services Trial. The new model will make better use of digital technology to support job seekers to find work and aligns with recommendations made by the Employment Services Expert Advisory Panel's report, <span style="font-style:italic;">I Want to Work: Employment Services 2020</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A key feature of the new model will be job-ready job seekers being able to self-manage their requirements through Digital Services and having more choice in how they meet their requirements through the Points Based Activation System. While job search remains a core element, job seekers will have greater agency to determine and access the activities they undertake on their pathway to employment and will be rewarded for their active effort and engagement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will enable job seekers to self-manage their requirements through Digital Services and access more flexibility and have greater control over how they meet their requirements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments to modernise social security law will better support online servicing and Points-Based Activation. This includes consolidating and streamlining Job Plan and exemption provisions, which are currently duplicated across four payment types, and clarifying that mutual obligations for unemployment payments can be met by complying with a Job Plan. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill also makes a range of other improvements to the social security law which are consistent with current Government policy and practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill removes the use of 'must' in provisions relating to the Targeted Compliance Framework and instead refers to circumstances in which a person 'may' be subject to compliance action, to better reflect operational policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also places in the social security law the legislative authority for employment programs to help job seekers find and keep paid work, making the authority more transparent and accessible. The Bill will enable more agile responses to pandemics and other emergencies, ensure that employment services assistance is not counted as income under social security law and clarify arrangements for job seekers who study as part of their requirements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Schedule 1</span> of this Bill will facilitate the use of technology to enable job seekers to manage their own mutual obligations and pathway back to employment using online services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government began trialling online employment services in July 2018 and significantly expanded these services in response to COVID-19. Departmental evidence shows that online servicing is effective, with over 400,000 referrals to online employment services between 20 March 2020 and 31 January 2021 exiting and not returning to employment services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Current social security law does not, however, adequately enable the best use of technology, as most of it was drafted decades ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will allow job seekers to choose their own Job Plan requirements, within departmental guidelines, and to manage their Job Plans online. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments in this Bill do not mean that computers will be delivering employment services to job seekers or approving Job Plans. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Human oversight and assistance will remain an integral part of all employment services. At any time, a job seeker can contact a person in the Digital Services Contact Centre for assistance or opt out of online employment services and agree their Job Plan with a human delegate at an employment services provider of their choice. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And all the existing protections will be retained. The Bill ensures that a delegate must always take a job seeker's circumstances into account and that a delegate cannot require a job seeker to enter into a Job Plan that contains unsuitable requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also streamlines and modernises social security law. This is because much of the social security law relating to mutual obligation requirements was written several decades ago and has not kept pace with changes to payments, employment services or mutual obligation requirements. For example, the Bill will remove the unnecessary phrasing of the 'activity test', which was introduced 30 years ago in 1991, at a time when unemployment payments and employment services were very different. In practice, job seekers meet their mutual obligation requirements by complying with the terms of their Job Plan and this will be more clearly reflected in the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will remove approximately 130 pages of superfluous social security legislation. The changes streamline and reduce the complexity of social security law to better support understanding and administration of existing mutual obligation policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Current policy and protections for job seekers will be maintained, while duplicated and redundant provisions are reduced to ensure the legislation is fit for purpose now and in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Schedule 2</span> of the Bill places legislative authority for Commonwealth expenditure on employment programs within the responsibility of the Employment Minister and department. This is more appropriate than current arrangements involving regulations administered by the Finance Minister, and will enhance the transparency and accessibility of the legislative authority while maintaining usual processes, including that funding for the programs will still need to come from annual appropriations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Schedule 3</span> more clearly supports the intent of the Targeted Compliance Framework to encourage job seekers to comply with their mutual obligation requirements and re-engage when they have failed to meet a requirement. The Bill ensures that sanctions need not be imposed when recipients of participation payments have a valid reason for failing to meet their requirements, or immediately re-engage, consistent with current practice and with the objectives of the Targeted Compliance Framework.</span>
                </p>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:41</span>):  The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Streamlined Participation Requirements and Other Measures) Bill 2021 certainly did need revising, but Labor is now in a position to support it. It seeks to streamline social security law in relation to JobSeeker payments under the new employment services model, taking effect from the beginning of the new financial year. Labor was very concerned that the savings attributed to this bill over the forward estimates were really going to come off the back of jobseekers and their access to social security payments. However, that has now been fixed in the House of Representatives along with a number of other key issues. We were at that time very concerned that the government was wanting to rush this through parliament without proper consultation and scrutiny. I can now report that there has been a great deal of pressure on the government, and as a result the bill has now been amended. According to ACOSS and those who have sought to influence the government, we're now better off passing this bill rather than objecting to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We note that last year the Education and Employment Legislation Committee had a very limited opportunity to inquire, and at that time it was rightly identified that shifting the start date for when payments were made to 10 days later on average, in conjunction with the shift to online services, would see a massive cost to the hip pocket of jobseekers, hitting Australians when they are most vulnerable. That schedule—schedule 8—has now been removed, and, by virtue of a number of other amendments—which have involved the Australian Council of Social Service, who I thank very much for standing up for the interests of Australians who, at various times in their life, rely on government social services payments—the bill has now been successfully changed in the House of Representatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that, from the outset, the government very much mishandled this bill. There was no rush for the legislation last year, and, as Labor highlighted earlier, the introduction of the new employment services model, which this bill supports, now takes place in July this year. The government previously attempted to rush it, but it could not get its legislative agenda together. Now, at the death knell, right before an election, we're finally in a position to pursue this bill. The important changes in this legislation deserved better consideration. The government did come to the conclusion that significant changes needed to happen to this legislation, and the government finally acted in the lower house.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the Labor Party support an employment services system that is fair and that also makes the most of technology to support jobseekers, employers and employment service providers. But we need to do more to get Australians into work, especially those who find themselves in long-term unemployment. Despite what you might say about unemployment figures, long-term unemployment—that is, the number of Australians who have been looking for work for more than 12 months—has actually increased under this government. This is a key challenge that this government is failing to address. More than four out of five of those who receive unemployment benefits are now classified as long-term unemployed. These Australians need more support. Of those Australians who are on unemployment benefits, 82 per cent have been on income support for more than a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is pleased that this bill has changed, as supported by ACOSS, and we support the bill as amended. The Labor Party can be trusted to ensure that no jobseeker is left behind.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  Josh Park-Fing was 18 years old in April 2016. He was 18 years old when he accessed income support and he was 18 years old when his employment services provider sent him to a worksite to collect rubbish. He was 18 years old when he died after falling off the back of a truck. For Josh's family and friends I know that the passage of time cannot dull their grief or diminish their pain. The aching gap of a missing life stays with us. It was four years later, in 2020, that the government finally released the report inquiring into his death. Josh would've been 22 if he hadn't died that day on the site that was providing a Work for the Dole program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we debate this legislation today, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Streamlined Participation Requirements and Other Measures) Bill 2021, it is important to remember that this matters for people's lives across the country. It's easy for some of us to forget, here in our air-conditioned building after a day of speeches and an evening of plenty to eat and drink, that we have a moral obligation to those we represent. We particularly have a moral obligation to the people across Australia who have faced and continue to face a cruel and punitive system, who have not received the support they need or they deserve, and to people who have been forced to live below the poverty line by ministers who just do not know what it's like, who don't care about the impact on people's lives and who refuse to act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The very title of this bill, 'streamlined participation', doesn't speak to people's experience of having to live with this system. It speaks to a bureaucracy who are getting that machine working in a very streamlined way and of people just being cogs in the machine, being corralled through a heartless system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have got a different vision. We believe that no-one should be living in poverty in a wealthy country where billionaires and big corporations are being subsidised by the government. In last night's budget we saw the horrific figure of $38 billion being given in subsidies to coal, oil and gas companies, but they cut funding for climate by 35 per cent. In a country that can afford to subsidise coal, gas and oil companies by $38 billion, we think we should be ensuring that no-one lives in poverty—not looking after billionaires and big corporations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, during the pandemic we had a little experiment where governments worked to lift payments above the poverty line and ensured a strong safety net where it was needed. And they suspended mutual obligations. That's what the Greens think we should be doing permanently. We want to see a liveable income guarantee that would lift people out of poverty and the abolition of the punitive system of mutual obligations. We want to abolish these punitive measures from our social security system so it is genuinely and easily available to those who need it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our vision is for a radically different income support system—one with a guaranteed liveable income where people are treated humanely, not treated as just cogs in the machine. Let me be clear: the pandemic showed that this is possible. Poverty is a political choice, and it's a choice being made every day by ministers in the Liberal government who are earning six-figure salaries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have consistently raised significant concerns about the current bill. As outlined by my predecessor, Senator Rachel Siewert, in the dissenting report on the inquiry into the bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Greens are extremely disappointed by the rushed nature of the inquiry into the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Streamlined Participation Requirements and Other Measures) Bill 2021. This bill encompasses significant changes to employment services, mutual obligations and compliance for income support recipients … Unfortunately, stakeholders were only provided with a few business days to consider the bill and make submissions to the inquiry. This is wholly inadequate for a suite of such significant changes. While there are some positive changes, such as more flexibility and agency in creating a job plan, a number of the proposed changes do raise deep concerns and need more careful consideration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that in the time since Senator Siewert wrote that dissenting report there have been changes to this bill and there have been changes made in the House of Representatives. I do want to note the work particularly of the Australian Council of Social Service in working to improve this bill. We recognise that these amendments will improve this bill and so we support these amendments. I want to note, however, that even this process of these amendments has been rushed. While I thank people, and thank those involved in their work to consult and the work that ACOSS have put in, the amendments weren't introduced in the House of Representatives in their final form until today. We are pleased to see that the key measure which was in schedule 8 that would have taken more money from those who were really doing it in the most difficult way is gone. We're pleased to see greater protections for those who are principal carers and who have a partial capacity to work. We welcome the guidelines—recognising that they reflect an amendment introduced by the Australian Greens. We do think these are genuine improvements on the original bill and we support them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will note that we still have incredibly significant concerns about fundamental aspects of the employment services framework. Based on our understanding, including of the draft delegated legislation, the framework is going to involve more people being forced into Work for the Dole, as participants are required to undertake it at the six-month mark rather than the one-year mark, and fewer people having the opportunity to actually engage with a human being.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise the improvements made by the amendments but we have still got really fundamental concerns about some of the most vulnerable people in our society who are forced to live below the poverty line, having their requirements dictated to them by an impersonal system. The loss of people that jobseekers are going to have to interact with is profound.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I received an email today from a person who works for what they describe as a high-performing employment agency who wanted to highlight to me what these changes will mean. On the issue of how many fewer people are going to be employed—real people to engage with people looking for work, to give them the support that they need to create the human system—this person writing to me said, 'It is estimated that from April this year 15,000 frontline case manager employees, predominantly female, will also be looking for work.' So there will be 15,000 fewer people being employed supporting jobseekers. This person then continued: 'As an individual, my work every day is about changing people's lives through employment, helping jobseekers to move off welfare payments and become active contributors to the local and national economy. The recent Australian government announcement of changes to established service providers will result in far-reaching disruption across the industry. It is highly likely that many of my colleagues will be made redundant. I worked for a high-performing provider that has failed to have their contracts for the rebranded jobactive service renewed in my area. My colleagues and I would like to know why the government removed high-performing providers from the market at a time when employers are crying out for staff and many of the most vulnerable jobseekers have an opportunity to take up work with our support and guidance. This unnecessary disruption to the market will impact employees like me, vulnerable job seekers already struggling to navigate the system as well as local employers struggling to find workers. The changes are likely to result in poor performance for a long period and will cost the taxpayer millions.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fundamentally, we're going to have a system that is now going to employ fewer people, providing less support yet with punitive measures of mutual obligations still being maintained. Fundamentally, the whole model is wrong. Fundamentally, we should be supporting people to find work without punitive mutual obligations. We should scrap that system entirely and provide genuine support for people without making them jump through useless hoops that actually don't help them to find work. Again, when mutual obligations were paused during the pandemic it in fact enabled and encouraged more people to seek work. They weren't having to jump through useless hoops to try and find work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we recognise the improvements that have been made to this bill we still have fundamental concerns, and I would like to move my second reading amendment in relation to this bill to address some of those concerns. Basically, we fundamentally do not think that the changes being proposed are enough to guarantee the protections that are needed for hundreds of thousands of Australians who are forced to interact with a system that is cruel, that is punitive and that does not provide the support that people need or deserve.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish by reflecting upon another woman that I met two weeks ago when we were launching our liveable income guarantee policy, which would lift people above the poverty line, give them $88 a day and abolish mutual obligations. We launched it outside the South Melbourne Centrelink. This woman told us she was homeless, she was living on the streets and she had zero income but she had decided that she was not going to continue to even try and engage with our social security system, because she found it just too damaging to her mental health. She had poor mental health. She had anxiety. She said she should have been on the disability support pension but that was impossible. For her, the system was just too hard, too harsh and too punitive. It was making her more unwell to even engage with the system, so she decided that she would prefer to have zero income and be living on the streets, homeless, rather than make herself more unwell by forcing herself to engage with the system. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it absolutely heart-wrenching that, in a rich country like ours, we have put people in this system. This bill is not going to change that system to make it a system that would work for women like that, and that is why the Australian Greens will be opposing this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator REYNOLDS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Government Services and Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:57</span>):  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="font-weight:bold;"></span>thank all senators for their contributions on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Streamlined Participation Requirements and Other Measures) Bill 2021 this evening. This bill modernises and streamlines social security law by reducing duplication and enabling jobseekers who are job ready the opportunity to self-manage their pathways to work using a digital platform, giving them more flexibility and choice. The bill enables a key element of the new employment services model known as Workforce Australia. Workforce Australia aligns with recommendations made by the Employment Services Expert Advisory Panel report, <span style="font-style:italic;">I want to work: employment services 2020</span>, which was the result of extensive stakeholder consultation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Current social security law is constraining the government's ability to provide the best possible service to jobseekers. For example, jobseekers who want to enter study or training into their job plan need to call the Digital Services Contact Centre to talk to a human delegate. This is an unnecessary burden on the hundreds of thousands of jobseekers who are job ready and who can and should be allowed to manage their own requirements online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also worth clarifying that the amendments do not mean that employment services or approving job plans will in fact be automated or that jobseekers are forced into a digital-only pathway. Human oversight and assistance will remain an integral part of all employment services. At any time, a jobseeker can contact a person in the Digital Services Contact Centre for assistance or opt out of online services and agree their job plan with a human delegate at an employment service provider. However, responding to stakeholder concerns, the government has agreed to make amendments to require that a digital protection framework be contained in the legislative instrument, providing greater assurance to stakeholders that employment services are administered ethically.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that protections within schedule 8 would ensure that jobseekers do not face delays in payment for reasons beyond their control. However, the government does not wish the passage of other important improvements to the social security law to be delayed, including changes to support the new model. Accordingly, the government agreed to move amendments to remove schedule 8 from the bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will significantly modernise and streamline social security law while maintaining existing protections and providing crucial support for the new employment services model. For all these reasons, I commend this bill to the chamber.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Retirement Income Review highlighted that accessing a portion of a person's home equity can greatly improve their living standards in retirement.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Participation in the Pension Loan Scheme is voluntary and the Scheme is similar to a reverse mortgage product.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It provides senior Australians the option of drawing a fortnightly loan amount, backed by the equity in their home or other real estate assets, to supplement their other retirement income.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Through the Scheme, <span style="font-style:italic;">pensioners</span> can top up their pension payment with loan payments, up to a maximum of 150 per cent of the fortnightly rate of the Age Pension. Eligible <span style="font-style:italic;">non-pensioners</span>, such as self-funded retirees, can receive the full 150 per cent of the fortnightly rate of the Age Pension in loan payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Morrison Government enhanced the Pension Loans Scheme in the 2019-20 Budget by expanding its eligibility to all older Australians of Age Pension age and increasing the maximum allowable fortnightly combined pension plus loan from 100 per cent to 150 per cent of the rate of the Age Pension. This allowed maximum rate pensioners to participate in the Scheme for the first time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since those changes came into effect on 1 July 2019, the number of participants in the Scheme, as at 30 September 2021, has grown from around 780 to over 5,000. This six-fold increase in two years demonstrates that the Scheme is meeting the needs of our senior Australians.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will introduce two additional features to the Pension Loans Scheme to further increase flexibility and confidence in the Scheme for those senior Australians who choose to use it. These measures will come into effect on 1 July 2022.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Firstly, a "<span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">No Negative Equity Guarantee</span>", will apply to all Pension Loans Scheme participants. It will mean that when Scheme participants settle their debt, they will not repay more than the equity they have in the property used to secure their loan. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Introducing a <span style="font-style:italic;">No Negative Equity Guarantee</span> brings the Pension Loans Scheme in line with a obligation placed on private providers of reverse mortgage products, who have been required, since 2012, to provide a <span style="font-style:italic;">No Negative Equity Guarantee</span> to users of home equity products.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">No Negative Equity Guarantee</span> will provide additional confidence for participants of the Pension Loans Scheme.

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DODSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:09</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Loans Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2021. I move the second reading amendment on sheet 1588 circulated in my name:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the end of the motion, add ", but the Senate notes that the Coalition Government has repeatedly tried to cut the pension, including pensioner concessions, the assets test and indexation, and attempted to increase the pension age to 70".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Pension Loans Scheme allows older Australians to get a loan from the Australian government to supplement their retirement income. This important social security program is a legacy of the Hawke government, offering older Australians the opportunity to tap into their home equity and unlock cash for an improved standard of living.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the benefits of the scheme, take-up rates have been very, very low. Only around 5,000 participants currently access the scheme. This is against a potential four million senior Australians of pension age, including around 2.6 million age pensioners of which 80 per cent are homeowners. The lack of take-up is primarily because of the barriers to access. These barriers are well known and have been known for the nine years of this government. Labor welcomed and supported previous changes made in 2018, but clearly more needs to be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These latest changes have come too late. Pensioners won't be fooled by this government and its last-minute attempt to support them. Pensioners know that this government has tried to cut the age pension and reduce their living standards at every possible opportunity. In the 2014 budget they cut $1 billion from pensioners' concessions, they axed 900 senior supplements to self-funded retirees and they tried to reset the deeming rates threshold and cut pension indexation. In 2015 they did a deal with the Greens to change the pension assets test, cutting the pension to around 370,000 pensioners by as much as $12,000 a year. In the 2016 budget they tried to cut the pension to around 190,000 pensioners as part of a plan to limit overseas travel for pensioners to six weeks, and they tried to cut the pension to over 1.5 million Australians by scrapping the energy supplement for new pensioners. The government also spent five years trying to increase the pension age to 70.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Spiralling out-of-pocket healthcare costs are a bigger concern for older Australians. These have come about because of the Medicare freeze put in place by the Morrison government. Pensioners know—and they're not fooled—that they can't trust this government to protect their living standards and act to offset rising costs—</span>

The question is that the second reading amendment on sheet 1588 be agreed to.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:05</span>):  So we're up to date with what we're dealing with here, colleagues, these are the amendments that were moved by Senator Canavan, but in his absence I will speak briefly on them. This deals with the two techniques that the bill proposes and effectively removes one of those techniques, still allowing the research and the procedures to go forward but in a limited way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The techniques for mitochondrial donation, for example the pro-nuclear transfer technique, result in the creation of two zygotes or embryos. The zygote that is left with defective mitochondria is then discarded. This raises, of course, the ethical issue of the creation of life—that is, a zygote—as a tool or instrument to help another life. This life is created with the knowledge that it will be destroyed. The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference said about these techniques:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the disposing of any human embryos because such actions would instrumentalise human embryos, treating them as part of a production process where they can be kept or disposed of subject to arbitrary judgements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments deal with that technique that involves the transfer of mitochondria after the creation of an embryo so as to not create embryos for destruction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments remove the pro-nuclear transfer and second polar body transfer techniques as approved methods. If these amendments pass, the research and clinical practice will continue—so, if you vote for this amendment, it doesn't mean that you're voting against the research in this field—but they do deal with the pro-life aspect of the technique that some might have some ethical issues with. The amendments deal with the techniques that transfer mitochondria between the prospective mother's and donor's eggs before the creation of life. These techniques, as I said, avoid the ethical controversy over whether a human life should be created simply as a tool to help another life. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some argue that the embryonic methods have shown more chance of success and, therefore, if we removed them from the bill, we would materially reduce the chance of a successful mitochondrial donation occurring. That's not correct. A recent report in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics</span> medical journal found that there had been three births, one in Mexico, one in Greece and one in Ukraine, using the techniques permitted by this bill. Two of these live births used the techniques that actually do not destroy embryos, so two-thirds would still be permitted if this amendment were to go through. Two-thirds of the births so far have used pro-life techniques. Only one of these births was performed for mitochondrial donation—the others were transferring material to overcome some fertility issues—and that birth used a method that does not destroy the embryo. So there's no evidence that these amendments would restrict the development of mitochondrial donation services, given the evidence that pro-life, non-destructive techniques can work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, colleagues, if you support research in this field you can actually vote for this and that research would be able to continue. But if you do have ethical issues with the use of embryos that, by their creation and design, are ultimately to be destroyed then this amendment would eliminate the possibility and remove that as an option as far as the research and use of these techniques go. I encourage you to support this amendment.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:10</span>):  I would like to associate myself with the remarks just put on the record by Senator O'Sullivan. I also want to acknowledge Senator Canavan in moving this amendment. For those who might be listening and just picking up the debate—and perhaps for senators who are here at this late hour and hoping that it won't be too late an hour by the time we depart—I just want to make some general remarks about the nature of this debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a debate that is informed by conscience. Happily, we live in Australia, where there's the freedom to practice our religion—although we have recently been unable to pass through this parliament legislation to prevent discrimination against people of faith. Nonetheless, I'm a senator from the Australian Labor Party and it was determined by our caucus that this matter would be a free vote on conscience. My conscience on these matters that we're debating about the sanctity of human life are informed by the great theological tradition and the language, practices and beliefs of the Catholic faith. That is only one faith among many. There are many people of other faiths who share the views that I'm going to express with my vote today in support of the arguments that were just put so cogently and succinctly by Senator O'Sullivan. But there are people of no faith who also share these views about the protection of human life and embryos. That is why this is such an important vote and debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very appreciative of my Labor colleagues and the Labor caucus in making sure that this evening, although there could have been the option considered to truncate the debate and to guillotine the debate, we are going to be allowed to debate long into the night, although that is not my intention. We will actually prosecute this, I hope, quite efficiently, because I think we know where it's going to land. Nonetheless, it's important for this parliament to preserve the right of people of faith to exercise their conscience in matters of life in particular. That's why this particular amendment is one I wholly endorse and support. I hope that those who hold that worldview, whether it's informed by faith or another form of morality and decision-making in their own life, will also support Senator Canavan's amendment that's up for discussion right now.</span>

I think it's incredibly important that we have this debate as a debate, not as a guillotine, and acknowledge that that's what the Senate has achieved tonight. I join myself with Senator O'Neill in acknowledging that we do not want to prolong this debate. I think it's important to recognise that, throughout, this debate has been conducted respectfully.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I won't belabour the point, if the Senate would just indulge me for a moment: this is my last day in the Senate, of course, and I will be contesting for the House of Representatives. I just want a moment for a personal reflection, to say that Senator O'Neill and I first met in 2002 when we both first stood as state candidates in a state election. I find it quite nice almost 20 years later to be standing here with her because the thing we had in common from that point was a passion for the Labor Party and a passion for the Catholic social justice principles and ensuring that people of faith had a voice in our party. So I'm very proud tonight to associate myself with her after the 20 years we've spent working together, and I look forward to doing it in, hopefully, a Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More to the point, I think it is important that we have these debates. I think it's important that these views be put. Based on the numbers, I acknowledge that there are some people who are not able to be here tonight to vote in the way they did a few weeks ago, due to illness and other reasons, and perhaps in a moment Senator O'Neill might want to acknowledge our colleague Senator Kitching, who would have made a contribution and would have voted in this debate. I want to thank Senator O'Sullivan for taking on Senator Canavan's amendments and making sure that we have the opportunity to express our views on them.</span>

Firstly, I say to my colleagues in the chamber that I watched the debate very carefully from afar, and I was extraordinarily impressed with the decency and respect with which the arguments were prosecuted. I have struggled with this bill in many respects. I have sought to try and convince myself to vote for the bill unamended, but, at the end of the day, I simply struggle on an ethical basis—not informed by any religious perspective—with the notion that one should create an embryo with the intention that part of it will be transferred and the balance destroyed. Hence I feel obliged, as a matter of conscience, to support this amendment. In particular I must say, Senator Keneally, I listened to your contributions very carefully during the last sitting and I found your arguments extraordinarily convincing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is simply a small amendment that seeks to prevent immunity from civil action. Of course, we are debating quite a significant change to the law, and we've been discussing during some of these divisions the creeping nature of this piece of legislation, which 20 years ago we were unwilling to introduce. I see in the chamber senators who were on the committee with me when we undertook this inquiry and who understand the portent of what we're undertaking tonight. Ultimately, history will reveal what it is that we have done, and I have fears and concerns, and that's why I am putting these amendments: to provide a degree of protection that I think we should be cautiously advancing with. This particular amendment, which I urge you to support, concerns an immunity from civil actions that I don't think researchers should be protected from. If this is such great and un-risky technology, then there should be no protection. Thank you.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last couple of amendments that we've considered are ones that really do go to a matter of conscience. I ask those who, to date, have made up their minds on their conscience just to look at this as legislators. This is more of a technical amendment, in my view, and I hope that you might be persuaded by the argument that mitochondrial donation research in the UK was, in fact, legalised in 2015. It began in one laboratory in Newcastle in 2016 and at this point of time, after six years of research, as we make this very important decision, there is absolutely no data available to Australians. That is very, very concerning to me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't know whether experiments have happened. We don't know what the experiments produced. We don't know, in fact, if there are any pregnancies, despite the hope that is held out. We don't know if there have been any live births. We don't know if there have been any unexpected difficulties or challenges. None of that has been made available to inform our decisions here. As the Australian mito bill is broadly modelled on the UK law, and as we are doing this on the back of reported success that is unobservable, it's reasonable, I believe, to expect that the results of the UK experiments would, at the very least, be available to the NHMRC's Embryo Research Licensing Committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment not only advances a position that I hold but supports the work of Senator Canavan to introduce stronger and more frequent reporting guidelines for this technology. Senators, whatever your conscience may tell you, I would put to you that this is just sensible legislative caution that requires our best attention, because this is about getting the facts on the record using the facts and the evidence from the only other jurisdiction that has advanced this piece of technology. So I seek your support for this amendment.</span>

Senator Canavan I think I acknowledged earlier on, because he was very instrumental, but there was Senator Duniam, Senator Farrell, Senator Fierravanti-Wells and, of course, Senator Polley, Senator Sterle and, most sadly, Senator Kitching. And I want to acknowledge, from the Labor team, that there was an arrangement to make sure that her vote counted and that an arrangement was made to honour her particular voting pattern. So I thank my colleagues for that. </span>

It's really one minute to midnight, and here we are discussing an issue of great importance to Australians, particularly Australians of faith. But, as Senator Scarr has indicated, you don't have to have a particular faith position to hold a humanist view and to vote for the amendments that I'm putting forward. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment calls for a clear and unambiguous measure of a successful test of compatibility before approval is granted. It will minimise the potential transmission of mito disease from the mother to the child, and there is recent research that shows strong evidence from large human population samples that mitochondrial and nuclear genomes are under selective pressure for compatibility, so those from eggs from different women can't be safely mixed and matched without impunity. The amendment is a response to that recent research. It's a measure to ensure efficacy of this experimental technology, for the safety of both the mother and the child. I urge senators to support the amendment. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment seeks to explicitly and unequivocally specify that mitochondrial techniques are solely licensed to be used for transfers between the egg or a zygote of a woman who is suffering mito disease to the egg or a zygote of a healthy woman. It would seem obvious that it's implied in the name of the legislation but, in reality, clarity is required. I would urge you to support this amendment, because it is essential. There is a great likelihood that some IVF clinics in other jurisdictions who claim to have used mitochondrial transfer techniques have used that to treat general infertility, especially in older women whose eggs are necessarily older. This seeks to be very explicit that this procedure is solely for the use of response to mitochondrial disease. </span>

An approval can only be granted if, among other things, under paragraphs 28P(4)(a) and (b), the trial participant or patient has a particular risk of their offspring inheriting mitochondria that would predispose them to mitochondrial disease and there is a significant risk that mitochondrial disease that would develop would result in a serious illness or other serious medical condition. The existing provisions in the bill are more stringent, indeed, than this which would provide potentially a less stringent limitation or an element of confusion to the bill. With that, I would encourage the Senate to oppose the proposed amendment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe this is simply an oversight in the legislation. The bill currently requires those who engage in mitochondrial research to comply with the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research, but it does not require compliance with the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research. However, both are referenced in the government's explanation of how clinical trials work. This amendment simply seeks to rectify that oversight. I know some senators are concerned that this would prevent the bill from proceeding at all. It is clear that the House is sitting tomorrow and, if the bill were to be returned there with these amendments if they are passed, that would give sufficient time for the House to complete the process. I seek senators' support.</span>

It was developed jointly by the NHMRC, the Australian Research Council and Universities Australia. Adherence to the code is actually a prerequisite for the receipt of funding from the NHMRC or the ARC. Given its prerequisite nature in that regard and the nature of the code itself, these amendments are not considered necessary to the operation of the bill or to ensuring that any who operate under the bill would be adhering to the code.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It strikes me, as I stand here in this seat where we commenced the week and I struggled to hold my composure and honour Senator Kitching, that I asked for this place to create a living legacy to her memory and that we might find a way to agree and disagree more respectfully. It's a little ironic that, as much as I despair that we're doing a conscience vote at 10 o'clock in a rather expedited way, I have to observe the nature of the conversation this evening around the room and the respectful nature of the debate—basically, because nobody's arguing. We've actually ended a very fractious period with a little bit of the way in which people might hope we operate in the future. I am proud to stand here with you as senators, and I also want to very much thank those who have supported the amendments that I've put forward, even though we knew pretty well that we were going to go down in the count. This is a reflection that there are a range of views across the Australian people. We reflect that in what we bring here, and it is, I think, a signature that we bring our perspectives across party lines to represent Australians in the best way that we can. I appreciate the opportunity for this debate and I thank you at this late hour for remaining to allow me to advance these amendments. This is the last one. You can cheer now.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a bill that acknowledges that adverse events are a potential outcome if this legislation is passed. It's an experimental technology, as I said earlier. There is only one other country that is actually operating under the auspices of a piece of legislation that allows this kind of research to go on, and it remains the case today, as we make our decision here this evening, that we do not know. We don't know if there have been successes or failures. We do not know if there have been aberrant results. We don't know anything after six years in the UK. And there are risks embedded in this technology.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance, Leader of the Government in the Senate and Vice-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:05</span>):  I thank Senator O'Neill for the observations that she made before in relation to the conduct of this debate. They're observations that I think I made at an earlier stage, particularly following the very extensive second reading contributions that were made around the chamber. Debates of this nature do tend to bring out the best of parliamentary contributions, and this bill is a bill that does present, on the one hand, the challenge of considering the impacts of medical conditions that have terrible consequences on families and children, and the intent of the bill is to seek to avoid those terrible consequences. Equally, it is a bill that presents ethical challenges and considerations in the construct of the bill and the theories and approaches that are being applied, and I know that, across the chamber, whichever way senators are voting, they have wrestled in their own way with those ethical considerations, weighing them against the objectives of the bill to help to ultimately save the lives of children and provide improved medical outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator O'Neill, in relation to the final amendment that you have moved, which seeks to create a compensation scheme, this is a somewhat challenging amendment that you present on the basis that the whole point of the bill and the donation techniques is to seek to reduce the risk of transmission of mitochondrial disease. If mitochondrial disease were to be passed on despite the techniques, then, depending on the severity of the disease, the types of supports that would ordinarily have been available to parents and families in those circumstances would be available, of course, through the health system. Were there to be instances of any evidence of medical negligence or otherwise, then the normal avenues would be available. But it is a bill that is seeking very much to ensure informed consent and knowledge and, as we stepped through earlier, the two-stage approach, in terms of the very extensive trial stage before moving into a clinical phase.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment also, in its composition, has some anomalous outcomes, in terms of compensation being limited to diagnosis when a child is born, at birth, whereas symptoms are sometimes only evident at a later stage. Compensation also is limited to mothers, which may not always be relevant in that regard, and there are areas in which it would deny compensation at the clinical practice stage, even though we're providing for it at the trial stage. I don't believe this amendment would aid in terms of the composition of the bill. I would encourage the amendment to be defeated, but I do very much again thank Senator O'Neill for her thoughtful contributions in the debate, as I do all senators for the way in which they engaged during the debate.</span>
