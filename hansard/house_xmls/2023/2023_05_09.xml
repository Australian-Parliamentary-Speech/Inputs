                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the parliament and the people of Australia, I send our sincere congratulations to His Majesty King Charles III and to Her Majesty Queen Camilla on their coronations. Along with other Commonwealth realms, Australia welcomes the new King and Queen and the beginning of a new era. The coronation of a new monarch has occurred only four times since Australia became a nation. At Federation on 1 January 1901, Queen Victoria was coming to the end of her long and remarkable reign. Her sons and grandsons followed her through the first tumultuous half of the 20th century; then her great-great-granddaughter, crowned 70 years ago, went on to eclipse her record to become Britain's longest-serving monarch. Until her passing last year, Queen Elizabeth II was the only reigning monarch most Australians had ever known, and the only one to visit our shores. Australians' personal respect and affection and admiration for her remarkable service will never fade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As King Charles takes up the duties his mother so faithfully fulfilled, he makes the same promise of lifelong service and the same commitment to the institutions of democracy that she vowed to uphold. The new King and Queen clearly intend to serve with energy, integrity and empathy. In his first speech as King, His Majesty paid tribute to the fine example his mother had set and promised to serve with loyalty, respect and love for people, irrespective of their backgrounds or beliefs. He spoke of the way that society had changed over his lifetime, transforming into one of many cultures and many faiths, even as the bedrock values of freedom and responsibility remain constant. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coronation itself is, in a profound sense, a part of this conversation between tradition and change, continuity and renewal. Even as he performs a role that has endured for almost a thousand years, the King makes his pledge in a modern world with a promise to the future. For more than 50 years, His Majesty King Charles has been a passionate champion of the environment, espousing the belief that we must think seven generations ahead to have any chance of leaving a better world behind us. He has a long record of interest in climate change, the urban environment and sustainability. As his reign begins, Australians know that we have a friend who celebrates our successes and stands with us in our times of disaster and distress, and a friend with a deep and abiding interest in issues relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His Majesty is no stranger to our shores. As a 17-year-old in 1966, he spent six months at Geelong Grammar School's Timbertop campus in the Victorian High Country. Recounting the story years later, he told an Australia Day crowd in London, 'If you want to develop character, go to Australia.' He has also professed his enduring love for the experience and described how it left him with a huge affection for our country—and I can assure the parliament that, when I have had the privilege of having an audience with King Charles, that affection has shone through. We look forward to welcoming him once again to Australia. This time, as one of 15 countries, it will be as our head of state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the King's mother, Elizabeth II, acceded to the throne on 6 February 1952, Australia's parliament expressed its faith in her as she took on the great responsibilities of the Crown and wished her a rich and kind reign. The world has changed radically since then, and Australia has grown into a mature and diverse nation, confident about who we are and our place in the world. As a mature nation, we will continue to examine our own constitutional arrangements and determine what they should be. King Charles has made it clear that these are matters that are rightly determined by nations of the Commonwealth and that those decisions are to be respected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an honour to attend the coronation and have private audiences with King Charles and the Prince of Wales, Prince William, and meetings with other members of the royal family, including the Princess of Wales. Along with the Governor-General and Mrs Hurley, High Commissioner Stephen Smith and the governors of all of our states, Australia's representatives reflected our nation's diversity at the request of the palace. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:12</span>):  Australians were glued to their televisions on Saturday night to watch our new King and Queen crowned. It was a wonderful occasion. It was historical, heartening and happy. As we watched on, we were all proud to see the Prime Minister and the Governor-General there on behalf of our nation. I want to acknowledge you, Prime Minister; His Excellency General the Hon. David Hurley; and the entire Australian delegation. Each of you represented Australia with grace and dignity. It was a great credit to each of you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of us have only ever lived under one monarch, such was the extraordinary 70-year reign of Queen Elizabeth II. Thus the crowning of King Charles III, our new sovereign, and Queen Camilla, who was at his side, was a truly momentous occasion. It was a momentous occasion for the British people, for Australians and for all citizens of the Commonwealth. It was a moment when an age-old tradition brought with it both a sense of reconnection to history and regeneration in our times. It was a moment of celebration that resonated around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Charles was the longest-serving heir apparent in British history. He was the boy who waited, the prince of patience and a king seven decades in the making. No other royal has journeyed longer to sit on the British throne and no other royal has been so prepared to wear the crown. Succeeding her father on the throne at age 25, Elizabeth was the Queen that we came to know and, succeeding his mother on the throne at age 73, Charles is the King that we already know. We know that he will be a decent, dedicated and well-disposed King. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his biography of Charles, Christopher Andersen recounted Elizabeth's coronation day. The newly crowned Queen emerged onto the balcony at Buckingham Palace cheered by a crowd of one million Britons. Next to her of course was her four-year-old son, Charles. In that moment the boy first understood how much his mother was loved by her people. In that moment young Charles first grasped the importance of the bond between the people and their monarch, a bond which held that country together and a bond that kept the Commonwealth united and strong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his first speech as King on 9 September last year, which the Prime Minister referenced earlier, Charles said that his beloved mother was an inspiration and example to him. In that address Charles's renewed promise of lifelong service echoed the promise his mother made on her 21st birthday. The King went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his Commonwealth Day address on 13 March, the King described the Commonwealth as a constant in his life, as an association of shared values, common purpose, joint action and extraordinary potential. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The myriad connections between our nations have sustained and enriched us for more than seven decades. Our commitment to peace, progress and opportunity will sustain us for many more.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our sovereign has a great affinity, as we know, for Australia. In many ways it was Charles's first trip to Australia which transformed the boy into the man. The Queen and Prince Philip arranged for young Charles to attend Geelong Grammar School on an exchange program in 1966, particularly to attend the remote Timbertop campus in the foothills of the Victorian alps. There, students received traditional classroom lessons combined with activities in the bush to develop resilience, self-reliance and strength. If Prince Philip had hoped the experience would test the young Charles' mettle and put some steel in him, he was right, for soon the 17-year-old prince was hiking, cross-country running, fishing, chopping wood and supervising younger students. He learned about natural history, and he encountered every Englishman's worst nightmare: huntsman spiders, tiger snakes, dragon lizards, leeches, fruit bats and bull ants. Meanwhile, under the guidance of history head Michael Collins Persse, with whom he would develop a lifelong friendship, Charles worked away at his A-levels, and in his public appearances, like meeting lifesavers at Bondi Beach, the prince would learn to conquer his paralysing fear of crowds. Collins Persse later reflected:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Everybody sooner or later discovered that … they had in their midst not only an inevitable celebrity, but a human being of extraordinary warmth and worth …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the resulting affection and understanding between him and Australians at large is a bond much appreciated by many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Charles who left our country was transformed. He was a very different figure from the shy boy who only six months earlier had skipped down the air stairs of a Qantas Boeing 707 in Sydney to nervously meet Governor-General Casey, Prime Minister Holt and their wives. In 1988, when Charles was in Australia for the bicentenary celebrations, he would reflect on that first trip down under. He described it as by far the best part of his entire education and something he would always cherish. Charles has visited our nation on 16 occasions spanning 10 different prime ministers. Notably, he attended the funerals of prime ministers Holt and Menzies on behalf of the Queen. He celebrated the 200th anniversaries of both James Cook's and the First Fleet's arrivals in Australia. He inaugurated the Anglo-Australian Telescope at Siding Spring in New South Wales, and he visited towns and cities across the country. He opened the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unexpected moments have stayed with us too—the prince being interviewed on <span style="font-style:italic;">Countdown</span> by Molly Meldrum, his emerging from the surf at Cottesloe Beach to be kissed by an audacious Jane Priest, and his cool-headed return to the lectern on Australia Day after being shot at by a student with a starting pistol. Our sovereign appreciates all too well our harsh and unforgiving climate. Never has Charles been remiss in sending wishes to Australians besieged by bushfires, floods and other natural disasters. At an Australian bushfire appeal in London in 2020 he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Amidst the horror and the sorrow, I have … felt the greatest possible sense of admiration for the extraordinary determination and resilience of the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over many years King Charles III has got to know Australians, and Australians have got to know him. We have come to know the philanthropist who has established more than 20 charities and is a patron of hundreds more, the aviator who flew planes for the RAF and helicopters for the Royal Navy, the conservationist who has passionately campaigned for environmental protection and sustainability since his first public speech aged 21 and the enthusiastic spectator and sportsman who has dabbled in many sports and is a very keen and fierce advocate for the arts in all their forms. At the 1988 bicentennial celebrations, Charles said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is no point now in trying to gloss over the circumstances in which the country, of which you are rightly proud, began.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He spoke of our nation's harsh beginnings and the hardship for all—for Indigenous Australians, the original people of this land; for the convicts sent against this will to an unknown country, which would have felt like another prison. But Charles also spoke of the Australian achievement, of the intelligence and courage of brave men and women who, in an astonishingly brief time, in a heartbeat of history, created a whole new free country. He spoke proudly of Australia being its own creation, a democracy which has become a model for the world, and of how that creation became the British gift of the rule of law. Profoundly, he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The true celebration of this nation is in its constitution. In those dry-sounding but hard fought for rules and regulations, every family in this remarkable country has its rights protected and cherished. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With our sovereign and his queen crowned, we celebrate change, but we also celebrate our historical connections with Britain and the British inheritance: representative democracy, parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law, the separation of powers, the English language, and freedom of speech, of association, the press and much more besides. May we never take this British inheritance for granted. May we continue to be custodians and defenders in the spirit of our own unique Australian creation, and may we always be proud of our British origins, along with our Indigenous heritage and our migration and multicultural success—three strands of our national story. King Charles is our head of state. In the crowning of a new king and all that the monarch symbolises, we remind ourselves of those British institutions and values which our forebears drew upon to forge a modern nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just like his mother, King Charles does not yearn for a return to empire. He understands that this is a vestige of the past, that the empire has receded into history. Importantly, our sovereign respects the right of the peoples of the Commonwealth to define their own destinies. In a speech on Australia Day in 1994, the Prince said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… there are those who would wish to see such a rapidly changing world reflected by a change in Australia's institutions … it is also not surprising that there are differing views: some people will doubtless prefer the stability of a system that has been reasonably well-tried and tested over the years …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The point I want to make here … is that this is something which only you—the Australian people—can decide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prince went on to say that he will always have 'an enormous affection' for our country, 'whatever course Australians ultimately decide upon', and in the meantime all his family 'will continue to take a close, personal interest in the welfare and fortunes of this country'. Those words, I think, show the humility, grace, generosity and understanding befitting a modern monarch. Our new King's virtues and values echo what we saw in our dearly departed Queen. Today, on behalf of the coalition and joining with this House, I congratulate Their Majesties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Question agreed to, honourable members standing in their places.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the House record its deep regret at the death, on 28 March 2023, of the Honourable John Charles Kerin AO, a former Minister and Member of this House for the Division of Macarthur from 1972 to 1975 and for the Division of Werriwa from 1978 to 1993, place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1972, when John Kerin was on the cusp of being elected to parliament for the first time, he headed home to Canberra from Labor's campaign launch, only for his Volkswagen to break down in the dark. The culprit was a broken accelerator cable. John not only diagnosed the problem; he fixed it with a paper clip and then drove home. That was John Kerin to a T—resourceful, practical, effective and with humour to spare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Born in Bowral, in the New South Wales Southern Highlands, John grew up farming, gaining experience as an orchardist, forestry worker and brick setter—and, of course, as a poultry farmer, one who could not only design a chook shed but hypnotise the inhabitants as well. Then as an economist with the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and eventually as the member for Macarthur and subsequently Werriwa, he knew how to make a difference. While he cut his teeth in the Whitlam government, it was in the Hawke government that he truly bloomed. He held a number of portfolios, including a brief stint as Treasurer. But he made his main mark as one of our longest-serving ministers for primary industries, arguably our greatest so far. He took to his work with experience, pragmatism, courage and an endless willingness to consult, a scientific dedication to facts and an insatiable curiosity. His record is fitting for a minister in the reforming powerhouse that was the Hawke government, his impact captured by the headline in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> when he moved on: 'Farmers sorry to see their popular minister go.' In 2008 he was made a distinguished life member of the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society—a fitting recognition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amid the sweep of his responsibilities, John didn't neglect his inner life. As he recorded in his memoir:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I once told John Button that listening to classical music kept me sane. He sagely advised me I should play a lot more music.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was typical of the lens through which he viewed himself—a mixture of clear-eyed perception and self-deprecation, all underpinned by a sense of humour that Bob Hawke described as 'quirky' and described by John himself as 'the despair of my family and friends'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John, of course, remained an active ACT branch member until the end. We will always be proud, so very proud, of all that he did. As he once wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Politics is like farming; no-one is forced to do it, but someone has to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John did both, and it is to Australia's lasting benefit that he did. We miss him greatly but no-one misses him so much as his family, some members of whom are with us today. I say to them: you are very much in our thoughts and you are in our hearts. May John Kerin rest in peace.</span>

From his late teens to his early 30s, he was a forestry worker, brick setter and farmer. Indeed, he worked some 80 to 90 hours a week on the land. It was John's love of the land that saw him take up a job as an economist at the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics in 1971.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The economist John also expressed his concerns about the excessive rate of inflation at the time. He said it was the 'major economic problem facing Australia' and 'the worst distributor of income'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John served as a solid and sage backbencher for Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. Alas, his longer-term ambitions were cut short when he lost his seat in Labor's 1975 landslide defeat. But he returned to ABARE. Evidently his time in government had not quenched his political thirst, for, in 1978, after his former prime minister retired as the member for Werriwa he successfully won that seat in a by-election. Joining the opposition led by Bob Hawke, John was catapulted into the position of shadow spokesperson for primary industries in 1980—a role very much befitting his background and experience. After Hawke's election victory in 1983 he took on that ministry, and by 1987 the energy portfolio was added to his responsibilities. He was an unwavering champion for Australian farmers. Under Prime Minister Hawke's leadership, John helped to eliminate many tariffs on agricultural imports. He introduced policies to increase farm productivity, and he championed research and development programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After Paul Keating unsuccessfully challenged Bob Hawke for the prime ministership in 1991 and resigned as Treasurer, John was appointed to the role. John would later admit he was not so lucky to have been Treasurer. The laser-like gaze of the media was on John immediately. From the get-go, comparisons were being made between him and the long-serving Keating. It was an unenviable position to be in. That pressure culminated in an infamous press conference, where John forgot a particular economic term. It was an honest but fatal mistake which saw him ousted from the role of Treasurer—yet another cruel reminder of the unforgiving nature of being part of the game of politics. John would later lament the change in character of the media in Australia, a media which he said, increasingly concentrated 'on question time and issues of conflict and personality to the exclusion of dreary policy'. After losing the Treasury portfolio, John was appointed as the Minister for Transport and Communications by Bob Hawke. But after Keating challenged Hawke again, this time successfully, the new Prime Minister appointed John as the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following Labor's 1993 election victory, John decided to be the master of his fate. He chose to exit politics on his own terms and not repeat the events of 1975. In his valedictory address, John said he would write a book, 'The formation of agricultural policy in Australia', but joked it would have a readership of about three people. Yet write a memoir he commendably did, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">The Way I Saw It; The Way It Was</span>. John's political memoir was also an insightful commentary on agricultural and natural resource policy. His observations remain salient for all of us today, that policy-making requires patience and perseverance, that emotional involvement has to be well managed if long-term policy solutions are to be achieved and that the best decisions were and are the ones where the most thought-through analysis and preparation are involved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John saw the bad side of politics, describing it as, 'a combination of theory, egomania, megalomania, mediamania and the rules of Gaelic football in a derived environment'. But he also treasured its good side. John said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The real buzz for me in politics has been that no two days are quite the same, you can grow and you get enormous opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Post-political life saw John chair many notable national and state based boards and councils responsible for coal, soil, land, grains, forestry, fisheries and water management. His cumulative life's work saw him rightly appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia. On behalf of the coalition, I offer my heartfelt condolences to John's colleagues, to his community and friends and, most importantly today, to his family, represented in the gallery and more widely. May he rest in peace.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the House record its deep regret at the death, on 29 March 2023, of the Honourable Stewart John West, a former Minister and Member of this House for the Division of Cunningham from 1977 to 1993, place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Try to imagine this scene: it's Wollongong in the early 1980s. Picture a kitchen table in a council house in the suburb of Berkeley just below the splendour of the Illawarra escarpment. Hard at work at that table is Stewart West, a former branch president of the Waterside Workers Union turned member for Cunningham and shadow environment minister. Maybe he's working in silence, as he often preferred. Maybe the radio is tuned in to a horse race. Spread before him is the environmental policy that Labor will take to its national conference. At its heart is saving Tasmania's Franklin River. Forty years later, as a direct result of that policy taken by Stewart West, the Franklin still flows wild and free. What a profound mark to make as a shadow minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the 1983 election lifted him out of the shadow and into power, Stewart West went on to serve with distinction as a cabinet minister in the Hawke government, holding the immigration, housing and administrative affairs portfolios. It was by any measure an extraordinary time in an extraordinary government, and Stewart was an important part of it. His passion for the environment, spanning the continent from Tasmania to Kakadu, was as powerful as his commitment to serve the people of Cunningham. In his beloved Wollongong he was central in saving the steel industry and in expanding the university. He was instrumental in reforming Australia's immigration policy and remained vocal about the plight of refugees long after his political career came to a close.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was willing to put his money where his mouth was. Stewart was a politician of unbending principle, one who cherished the privilege of being in cabinet but nonetheless prioritised principle over career. It was a choice that he had to make along the way, resigning from cabinet over a matter of principle. No-one joins the Labor Party for a smooth ride or a quiet life. It's not our nature. People are passionate about doing what's best for our country, but, while we generally agree on the destination, there are sometimes powerful differences of opinion on how to get there. So it was when Stewart quit cabinet over uranium policy. As our great mutual friend Tom Uren would later record, 'I've never seen anyone so broken-hearted for so long as Stewart over that decision.' But such was the calibre of the man that the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, soon brought him back into the fold and restored his position in the cabinet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over many years, I was proud to sit beside Stewart West at ALP national conferences. I was proud to stand alongside him to improve the lives of working Australians, and I am grateful for the advice that he gave me as a young man and for the lessons that he taught me. I'm honoured to speak now of his achievements. Stewart died just two days short of his 89th birthday, but his legacy and all that he was remain with us. Our hearts go out to his loving wife, Mary, and to all of his family, to all who loved his company and his laughter, and to all who held a special place in his heart, particularly the great people of the great city of Wollongong. May Stewart West rest in peace.</span>

                  <a href="00AKI" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  I join the Prime Minister in honouring the life of the Hon. Stewart John West. Stewart was a Labor man through and through. He lived and breathed Labor ideals. Prior to entering parliament, he was a lifelong trade unionist. He was the president of the Port Kembla branch of the Waterside Workers Federation, he served as the secretary of the ALP's Cunningham federal electorate council and he was the successful campaign manager for the formidable Rex Connor for five elections.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the recipient of Rex's mentorship, Stewart was, of course, his inevitable successor. After Rex's sudden passing in 1977, Stewart was swept into office with 56 per cent of the vote at the Cunningham by-election. In his maiden speech, Stewart spoke proudly about the electorate he knew so well—an electorate which was now his to represent. He described it as the 'greatest industrial and steel-producing centre in this nation' and he spoke passionately about the concerning issue of unemployment, describing it as a 'cancer' bedevilling Cunningham. Indeed, unemployment there was more than three per cent above the national average. Under Bill Hayden's opposition, Stewart was appointed the shadow spokesperson for Aboriginal affairs, then for environment and conservation, and then for finance and trade. In the spirit of social movements, he lent his support to those who campaigned to prevent the building of Tasmania's Franklin River dam and to protect Kakadu.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stewart's environmental concerns, coupled with the shadow of cold war, saw him become an energetic exponent of nuclear non-proliferation. At an ALP national conference in mid-1982, the party was split on the stance a future Labor government should adopt on uranium mining. The famous Hogg amendment sought to change the party position from an immediate ban on uranium mining to one supporting its phasing out over time. Stewart spoke fiercely against the motion, which narrowly passed. He emerged from the conference despondent and near to tears, as one reporter wrote. Indeed, it was Stewart's convictions on this issue which saw him later resign from a cabinet position in 1983 after Bob Hawke's Labor government decided to sell uranium to France. Whether one agrees with Stewart's position or not, no-one can deny that he was a man of great courage and that he put his convictions ahead of his own career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No doubt there was something Bob Hawke admired in Stewart's character and integrity—not just that but his upbringing, the way that he'd been styled, the way that he contributed to debates. From 1984 the Prime Minister reappointed Stewie, as he called him, to the cabinet. Under Hawke's leadership, Stewart served as the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and then the Minister for Housing and Construction, and finally the Minister for Administrative Services. As immigration minister he championed family reunion and the resettlement of refugees while being an advocate for antidiscrimination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the leader of the Left faction of the Labor Party, Stewart found it difficult to manoeuvre in Bob Hawke's cabinet, dominated by the Right faction. Stewart John West was certainly that calibre of politician who never saw popularity or promotion as worthy of selling out one's principles. In many ways, it's the politicians of principle which history tends to remember. On behalf of the coalition, I offer my heartfelt condolences to Stewart's colleagues, to his community and his friends, and to his family. May he rest in peace.</span>

There has been much media regarding this report since it was first published. I'm very pleased to thank the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Mark Butler, who was the initiator of the inquiry, for the $50 million package for research regarding long COVID, which will be very important in planning how we deal with the many twists and turns of this pandemic in the future—in terms of long COVID in particular.</span>

We have achieved much already in terms of knowledge and understanding of long COVID, but there is much to be done. We don't know what we don't know, and much will be discovered, I'm sure, over the ensuing years. What I do know is that long COVID is having an effect on our population. It is in particular affecting women more than men. It is affecting people in the most productive years of their lives—often those who have employment, have families and have commitments in our society in general.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="281513" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McINTOSH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:49</span>):  by leave—I'd like to acknowledge the chair, Dr Mike Freelander, the member for Macarthur, for his outstanding leadership of this inquiry—the first inquiry of its kind in this country into long COVID. When we started this inquiry I had been having my own experience with persistent symptoms after contracting COVID in April 2022. I wasn't able to find in the public sphere adequate information about what I was experiencing—and I wasn't alone in this. I believe the health committee inquiry could be useful, at least in terms of filling an information gap. There had yet to be an official inquiry, as I said. What we didn't know at the start of the inquiry was that it's not so much an information gap as a data, diagnosis and treatment gulf. We don't yet have a definition of what long COVID is in Australia, let alone have consistency in how people are diagnosed and then looked after.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee recommends that the World Health Organization definition of long COVID be used at this time. But the definition has its failings, including not being quite clear enough for clinical purposes. Despite this, without an official definition people just can't get the care they need, whether it be through their GP, who may not have received adequate education on long COVID, or via a long-COVID clinic, which we heard have some extraordinary waiting times, leaving people without proper treatment for up to a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also come to realise that the relatively short symptoms of breathlessness and fatigue that I had were very mild compared to how much some people around the country are suffering with long COVID. They're so sick they can barely get out of bed many months after the onset of their symptoms. Long COVID is having a major impact on lives and livelihoods. The committee received almost 570 submissions during the inquiry, and it is clear the committee has uncovered a very significant condition that could affect between two and 20 per cent of people infected with COVID. The lack of a precise number reflects the whole problem we have with understanding long COVID in this country: we just don't have the data. The No. 1 recommendation of the inquiry is the establishment of a COVID-19 database, including the recording of long-COVID diagnoses and complications. Data linkages with the states and territories are essential for its effectiveness as, ultimately, it needs to be about consistency in diagnosis and treatment of people with long COVID, no matter where they live in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not too long after we started the inquiry, my very athletic and healthy 19-year-old son Byron was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. It is well known that certain viruses can trigger type 1, which is an autoimmune disease, and the only known virus that Byron had before diagnosis was COVID. When Byron was diagnosed in October 2022 there was very little data on whether it was plausible that COVID caused it, but reports were starting to surface that there had been a surge in type 1 diabetes globally amongst children and adolescents. Six months later, research is showing a correlation between COVID and type 1 diabetes, and the committee was provided evidence of this during the inquiry. The Victorian Department of Health noted that long COVID may be associated with more serious issues, such as increased risk of developing diabetes. Diabetes Australia told the committee that research funding should be made available to further investigate COVID related new-onset diabetes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The increased prevalence of disease is not just reflected in all cases of type 1. The evidence heard by the committee about what COVID can do to your body makes for less than light bedtime reading. The Australian Society for Medical Research advised that future research needs to include how a COVID infection can initiate the development of conditions that evolve over time to cause organ dysfunction or increase the risk of developing other disorders. The committee made a recommendation to the Australian government that funding is required for coordinated and thorough research into long COVID. As deputy chair of the committee, I would highly encourage that this include research into the serious diseases that are developing in people that have contracted COVID. It's a public-health imperative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I finish, I just want to touch on COVID and mental health. This is another area that is suffering from a lack of evidence for whether the mental health impacts of long COVID are a biological or a psychological response to having long COVID—or possibly both. It is clear from the inquiry that, for many people, long COVID is having a significant mental health impact, which can be debilitating and life-changing. As the shadow assistant minister for mental health and suicide prevention, it concerns me greatly to hear from individuals about their declining mental health, including feelings of uselessness, anxiety and depression. The committee has recommended that mental health support for those with long COVID must be provided in an affordable, timely and equitable manner. I would like to see the government prioritise this recommendation. We're experiencing a mental health crisis in this country, and the seriousness of this should not be underestimated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This first-of-its-kind inquiry into long COVID has given thousands of people across Australia hope that politicians as policymakers are listening. It is clear there are unacceptable gaps in data and research and inconsistencies in diagnosis and treatment, particularly when it comes to where people live and their socio-economic status. The inquiry has provided the evidence that it doesn't have to be this way. There are ready-to-go solutions in the committee's recommendations, and I'd like to commend the chair again for his wonderful leadership and work. Those recommendations just needed to be actioned. As deputy chair of the health committee, I endorse them and hope that we see some strong commitments in the government's budget.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—This report considers three proposals referred to the committee in February and March with a combined value of just under $104 million. The first proposal, from the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts, is for a seawater reverse osmosis plant for the Cocos (Keeling) Islands's West Island, which we visited. The second proposal, from the Australian Taxation Office, is for a fit-out of existing leased premises at 200 Collins Street, Hobart, Tasmania. The third proposal, from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is for the proposed construction and decommissioning of the Australian Pavilion at the World Expo 2025 in Osaka, Kansai, Japan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The department of infrastructure's reverse osmosis plant will bring water security to the important community of West Island. The only current water supply for the community is considered extremely vulnerable to contamination, a threat that is compounded by the risk of further contamination during the upcoming airfield upgrades. The total cost of the proposed project is $19.6 million. The committee considers that this project is of the utmost importance to ensure that the community of West Island has permanent access to safe drinking water. The committee is aware that the island's community is looking forward to a secure and reliable water source. This plant will also support future economic and tourism development on Cocos (Keeling) Islands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second proposal in this report is the ATO's fit-out of existing leased premises at 200 Collins Street, Hobart. The total cost of the proposed project is just under $24½ million. At our public hearing, the committee heard about staff concerns that there had been a lack of consultation in relation to the project. The CPSU believed that there had been missed opportunities in the design process for workers to participate and share their views. The committee was somewhat reassured by the ATO, who discussed that design changes have been made based on feedback and that there would be more opportunities for feedback on the final design. The committee still has concerns and has recommended that the ATO should be conducting broader staff consultation during the design phase of future fit-outs, which should be reflected in any future submissions to the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third project in this report is the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's proposed construction and decommissioning of the Australian Pavilion for the World Expo in Osaka. The total cost of the public works is $59.8 million. Australia's participation in the 2025 World Expo came at the request of the Japanese government and will offer an important opportunity for Australia to further strengthen its relationship with a key strategic and economic partner. Although the expo pavilion will be built and then removed after six months, the committee is satisfied that DFAT is considering environmental impact and options for waste reduction. The committee supports this project.</span>

We'd also like to thank personnel from the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts, the ATO and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for their presentations on these projects and for facilitating site inspections in Hobart and on Cocos (Keeling) Islands.</span>

I acknowledge the work of the chairman of the committee on these very important matters—particularly on Cocos (Keeling) Islands, which we know are critical in terms of Australia's forward-facing infrastructure, particularly for Defence and others. I also acknowledge the forbearance of those that live on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. They will have a competitive edge and competitive costs when it comes to the matter of the seawater reverse osmosis plant project, which is relatively unique: saltwater bores enter reverse osmosis to provide fresh water for the residents that live there, along with a number of others who live on the defence base, and for the airport et cetera.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, I couldn't make it to the tax office facility in Tasmania, so I'll leave that alone. But I will come to recommendation 4, in regard to the proposed work by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at the World Expo 2025 Osaka facility. We did have long discussions—as acknowledged by the chair and others—and I thank DFAT and others for putting forward their propositions. Whilst it is supported, I do still have concerns about the cost of the proposal, at $60 million, but it is up to the government to demonstrate value for money. Japan is a critical partner in trade, along with a number of other matters on which we deal with them on an international level.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had some concerns about DFAT's priorities, in terms of what was being put forward on the forward-facing part of the facility and the pavilion, given that our major exports to Japan are coal and gas, and our major reasons for trading with them are around coal and gas exports and of course the opportunities for tourism and education on a two-way-trade basis. It didn't seem that that lined up with DFAT's priorities for the expo. I do look forward to seeing them have a successful expo, and I congratulate them on the work they do, but I am concerned about the cost, given what has been expended on previous expos around the world, and as to whether it's value for money.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LITTLEPROUD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:02</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2023. The federal coalition wholeheartedly supports this bill because what this legislation delivers is the policy that we, on this side of the House, announced while we were in government and enshrines it in law. The federal coalition has always supported northern Australia, and we are extremely proud of our achievements and the legacy that we secured for this part of the nation during our time in office. It was the federal coalition who first set up the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, the NAIF, in 2016, which was a landmark investment platform designed to drive economic infrastructure across the north. It was the federal coalition who developed the northern Australia white paper to outline the challenges and opportunities that exist in an area which covers more than half of our land mass, and it is the federal coalition that continues to fight for those regional communities to ensure that those who grow our food, mine our resources and build our nation get the recognition they rightfully deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under our government, the NAIF made over 31 investment decisions, totalling $3.4 billion, supporting projects with an estimated total capital value of $6.5 billion across northern Australia. These projects range from airports and higher education facilities to clean energy infrastructure, resources and agricultural ventures. The projects that the NAIF supported are forecast to generate around $25 billion in economic benefits and create more than 13,000 jobs. Importantly, the coalition extended the NAIF's lifetime by an additional five years, to 30 June 2026, so that it could continue delivering critical investments to the northern regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the legislation before the House today, there are two substantive amendments within the bill and one technical clarification. The first substantive amendment expands the NAIF's area of operation. In December 2021, the federal coalition announced that the Indian Ocean territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands would be included in the NAIF's jurisdiction and able to receive support. This extension will allow the NAIF to continue delivering vital investments in more parts of northern Australia. The Indian Ocean territories have so much potential to capitalise on, including sustainable tourism, with their incredible biodiversity and unique landscapes. The inclusion of the Indian Ocean territories in the NAIF will help incentivise private sector investment in these regions and support businesses in the Indian Ocean territories to diversify and grow. This expansion opens up a variety of opportunities for the region, especially in the tourism sector, and enables local businesses to tap into their natural competitive advantage and provide jobs for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second substantive amendment in the bill is to increase the NAIF's funding from $5 billion to $7 billion. This is an important measure that we fully support. In fact, it was the federal coalition that further committed to strengthening the development of northern Australia by announcing, back in January last year, a $2 billion funding increase for the NAIF from $5 billion to $7 billion. This increase will support additional projects throughout northern Australia, and it's good to see the government honour this commitment. Ultimately, the government's backing of these two coalition announcements is a true affirmation and recognition of the great policy that we developed for northern Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be noted that, following the statutory review of the NAIF in December 2020, the federal coalition moved amendments to the act in 2021. As part of the extended scope, amendments were made to allow the NAIF to provide financial assistance to entities other than states and territories and to provide loans in addition to grants. This expanded availability for support includes regional Indigenous Australians and provides an avenue for economic growth and investment in local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in this part of the nation. Overall, the bill before us today is simply a technical clarification and it's a continuation of the federal coalition's policy to build the north.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While it's welcome to see Labor continue to fund the NAIF, it's a huge concern to see the government slash other regional funding that is critical to northern Australia and our regional communities all over the country. This government's cuts and delays to infrastructure in regional Australia amount to billions of dollars, and northern Australia will feel the impacts of this. Giving with one hand and taking away with the other is not a formula for success.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the north it was the coalition government who delivered $1.9 billion for the Roads of Strategic Importance initiative, committed an extra $678 million for the Outback Way and secured $300 million under the Northern Australia Beef Roads Program. The coalition government fought hard to deliver tremendous amounts of federal funding to build critical infrastructure in the north. Rest assured that the coalition will continue to fight for northern Australia. I'm pleased to confirm that we will support this bill, which puts the coalition policy into law.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHESTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:07</span>):  On behalf of the coalition I rise to speak on the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Independent Review) Bill 2023, which is before the House. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Infrastructure Australia Act 2008 to give partial effect to the government's response to the Independent Review of Infrastructure Australia, which was released on 7 December last year. Reviewing Infrastructure Australia was a pre-election commitment of the government, and the independent review of this body was announced on 22 July 2022. It was undertaken by two respected Australians: Nicole Lockwood, Chairperson of Infrastructure Western Australia, and my good friend Mike Mrdak AO, a former secretary of the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development and a former secretary of the Department of Communications and the Arts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Infrastructure Australia is a corporate Commonwealth entity that was established by the Rudd government in 2008. It's also worth noting that this body is in fact a creation of our current Prime Minister when he served as the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government in that era. It's quite telling that this government has assessed the performance of Infrastructure Australia over its nearly 15-year life and found the organisation wanting. This bill represents, at the very least, a partial repudiation of the organisation's functions and governance structures as they were fundamentally established by the now Prime Minister himself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill provides a new object of the act—for Infrastructure Australia to be the government's independent adviser on nationally significant infrastructure investment planning and project prioritisation. This gives partial effect to recommendation 1 of the independent review. The coalition notes the independent review's first recommendation to the government includes the advice that Infrastructure Australia 's mandate should be expanded beyond advising on nationally significant transport, energy, communication and water infrastructure to also be the government's independent adviser on nationally significant social and economic infrastructure. Recommendation 6 of the independent review also suggested Infrastructure Australia's remit be expanded to include social infrastructure. These recommendations have been rejected by the government and are therefore not featured in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also repeals almost all of the current functions of Infrastructure Australia as provided in paragraphs 5(a) to (gb) and sections 5A to 5C of the current act. In place of Infrastructure Australia's current functions the bill proposes a series of new functions and products to conduct audits or assessments of nationally significant infrastructure to determine adequacy and needs, to conduct or endorse evaluation of infrastructure projects, to develop targeted infrastructure lists and plans and to provide advice on nationally significant infrastructure matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also amends the Infrastructure Australia Act 2008 to replace the current 12-member Infrastructure Australia board with three commissioners appointed by the minister, comprising a chief commissioner and two commissioners. Additionally, transitional arrangements are included in the bill, to recognise the existing work of Infrastructure Australia. What we have here in this bill is the government admitting that the legislative structure put in place originally by the now Prime Minister needs to be fixed, and as a result they have decided to give Infrastructure Australia a new object, new functions and a completely new governance structure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this bill is framed as giving effect to the recommendations of the independent review, it's important to place on the public record that a critical assessment of the response to the review shows the government has not in fact accepted some of its key recommendations. The review received 59 submissions and held 40 meetings with approximately 140 participants across government and industry. In October 2022 the independent review provided its report to the government, outlining 16 recommendations and a further matter for government consideration. As mentioned, the government's response to the independent review did not support a number of the report's recommendations. In fact, eight of the 16 were not supported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government did not support key recommendations to provide enhanced transparency. An example of this was the proposal that Infrastructure Australia provide two new annual statements to the government, which would be publicly tabled to inform budget processes and to report on the performance outcomes being achieved by the infrastructure investment program. Also, a proposal that the Australian government must formally and publicly respond to Infrastructure Australia's advice, findings and recommendations within six months was not supported by this government. Despite what the government says, the Australian people can clearly see this administration has an aversion to being transparent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also did not support the recommendation to form an infrastructure bodies council to enable better collaboration and coordination between Infrastructure Australia and the states and territories. Several other recommendations of the independent review will be implemented via non-legislative processes, including by a ministerial statement of expectations and an infrastructure policy statement on land transport. The independent review proposed three alternative models for the future governance of Infrastructure Australia: option 1 was to maintain the status quo; option 2 was to establish a commission model, which was their preferred model; and option 3 was for a streamlined board model.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposal in this bill represents an altered version of option 2. By proposing to replace the 12-member Infrastructure Australia board with three commissioners, the government is reducing the diversity of expertise at the head of this body and reducing its independence from government. The views of the minister will hold significant influence with the three commissioners, who are themselves appointed by the minister. This compares with the current governance model, whereby nine Infrastructure Australia board members are appointed by the government and three are appointed from nominations agreed by the governments of the states, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When added to the redefined functions of Infrastructure Australia in this bill, which require the commissioners to have regard for the government's policies and require them to evaluate infrastructure proposals submitted by the government, it's clear Infrastructure Australia will enjoy less independence in the future. In addition, the government has confirmed via briefings that an advisory council will be established by Infrastructure Australia to provide advice to the commissioners. Unfortunately, the advisory council is not referenced in the bill, and therefore the parliament is not being invited to set guidelines about the composition or role of that proposed advisory council.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition reserves the right to have more to say on this during the debate in the other place. However, briefings have confirmed the government's intention, as outlined in their response to the review, that senior officials from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts will sit on the advisory council, supported by three to four experts from the infrastructure and labour sectors. This is the heavy hand of the Commonwealth government stepping in to influence the decisions and the direction of Infrastructure Australia. There is a concern here that, in making these changes of the government's to Infrastructure Australia, industry expertise may be lost, as well as expertise and experience in delivering infrastructure in regional Australia in particular. The government has made no provision in the bill for commissioners to be appointed who have expertise and experience in the issues impacting regional Australia. The coalition will therefore propose amendments during consideration in detail to address this concern, and I encourage the government and all members of this place to give close consideration to supporting these.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to making Infrastructure Australia less independent, the government's reforms will make Infrastructure Australia a less authoritative body when it comes to the evaluation of infrastructure projects. Firstly, the minister has made it clear the government wants to shrink the number of projects on the infrastructure priority list; this is mentioned in the explanatory memorandum. Interestingly, while the relevant clause in the bill, being 5C(1), refers to the development of a targeted infrastructure priority list, nowhere in the bill does it require the list to be any smaller—or larger, for that matter—than currently exists. Indeed, the briefing provided to the coalition by the government on this bill has confirmed there is nothing in the bill which will prevent a future government from working with Infrastructure Australia to expand the infrastructure priority list if the government chooses to reduce its investments in infrastructure projects. However, by proposing to streamline Infrastructure Australia's focus on a smaller number of nationally significant projects, the government is reducing its utility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, and perhaps more significantly, the government is proposing Infrastructure Australia merely endorse project assessments submitted by the state and territory governments. This is a government walking away from providing independent oversight and assessment of the priorities of the state governments. While there is reference to the agency developing a national planning and assessment framework to promote national consistency in infrastructure evaluations, as a Commonwealth body Infrastructure Australia lacks the power to enforce assessment standards on state and territory departments and agencies. The Commonwealth government makes a substantial investment into public infrastructure which is delivered and ultimately owned by the states and territories. Often the Commonwealth is investing 50 per cent—or, in regional areas, 80 per cent—of the funding to deliver major road projects. Australian taxpayers expect the Commonwealth parliament to exercise suitable oversight so that infrastructure projects deliver material benefit and that maximum value for investment is secured. This should be an important role for Infrastructure Australia. But will the organisation's ability to provide advice on this be diminished by the requirement in this bill, so that they endorse the state assessments instead of running an independent ruler over project submissions themselves?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition recognises that, since the election, there have been questions over the future mandate and operations of Infrastructure Australia. As a result of this government's approach to the body and its leadership, in September 2022 there were five resignations from the board. This has resulted in several months where the board has lacked a quorum of members. The government has subsequently appointed interim board members until such time as its proposed reforms can be enacted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition firmly believes Infrastructure Australia is an important body, and it's important that parliament provides the organisation with a clear mandate for its future activities. In this regard, the federal coalition does not seek to frustrate passage of the government's legislation—albeit there are concerns that this bill will result in Infrastructure Australia being less independent and less authoritative. The coalition proposes to support the legislation with amendments which will be designed to ensure that the commissioners have experience on the issues of regional communities and provide transparency where, contrary to its pre-election commitments, the government makes nationally significant infrastructure and investment decisions without obtaining advice from this body.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:20</span>):  I rise to speak on the Family Law Amendment Bill 2023. There are few things in the Commonwealth Attorney-General's portfolio that have more direct impact on Australians than family law. Every year, tens of thousands of Australians will find themselves going through the pain and sadness of separation, and, in a small proportion of these cases, disputes will be decided by a judge in Australia's family law courts. As a nation, we should aim for a system that resolves those disputes as quickly and cleanly as possible and, where children are involved, we should at all times prioritise their best interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many parts of this bill are moved by good intentions, and we join with the government in recognising that many of the issues in this bill seek to address problems in need of a solution. And yet in too many places the proposals put forward by the government in this bill do not align with those problems. They go beyond recommendations made by previous reviews, are not supported by professionals, have unintended consequences or have not been road tested in communities on the ground. The coalition's very deep concern is that, although we join with the government in recognising the problems, the solutions in this bill are untested and may actually make things worse for Australian families. That is something that we, as legislators, should be very cautious about, particularly when we're dealing with a system that is meant to guide them through some of the most important and difficult parts of their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of this bill deals with the parenting framework in the Family Law Act. The most significant part of this schedule would repeal the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility that applies when courts make parenting orders. The changes which introduced that presumption were one of the achievements of the Howard era. Prior to 2003 there were widespread concerns across the Australian community about contact and residency issues for children following marriage and relationship breakdowns. There was a widespread sense that many separated parents felt excluded from their children's lives following separation. Often, this turned the debate away from the benefits for children of a positive and caring relationship with both parents to all the arguments about why equal time will or will not work. This was against the backdrop of the inquiry commissioned by former prime minister Howard into the family law system, chaired by Kay Hull AO, which resulted in the landmark <span style="font-style:italic;">Every picture tells a story</span> report. That report was remarkable in that its recommendations were unanimous and bipartisan. A rollcall of past Labor luminaries—Julia Irwin, the Hon. Graham Edwards, Jennie George AO, Hon. Roger Price and Harry Quick—joined with the coalition in recommending a rebuttable presumption of equal shared parental responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those recommendations were given effect by the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Act 2006. Among other things, those reforms said that courts must apply the presumption that it's in the best interests of a child for there to be equal shared parental responsibility. Importantly, the presumption does not apply in circumstances where there is abuse or family violence. And it is not a presumption that parenting orders should allocate time to parents on a 50 per cent basis. Rather, it's about the shared responsibility that parents have in decision-making for their children after separation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2006 reforms established important guardrails for courts making parental orders, but many of those guardrails would now be removed by Labor's reforms in a way that goes beyond what the evidence supports. We recognise that the law needs to keep pace with changes in society and that, where there is room for improvement, we should improve it. That is why the former coalition government initiated an ALRC inquiry into the family law system, the report of which was handed down in March 2019. The report said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ALRC supports the idea that a presumption of shared parental responsibility serves as a good starting point for negotiations between parents and recommends that the concept be retained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ALRC agreed 'in principle with the existing exceptions to that presumption'; however, it noted that, in practice, 'equal shared parental responsibility' had often been conflated with equal time with the children, and it recommended the provision be co-located 'with the provision creating the presumption'. Labor's amendments go much further than has been recommended. Labor proposes repealing the presumption entirely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many across the legal profession have raised concerns. It is worth noting that the Attorney-General's consultation on the exposure draft of this bill did not ask whether the presumption should be retained. It missed the fundamental question. Instead, it asked whether its changes would make it easier to explain the law and whether, with the removal of the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility, certain other provisions should be retained. It treated the removal of the presumption as a given. Yet, despite this skewed and one-sided approach, despite this never being asked, parts of the profession have been ringing alarm bells.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Family Law Practitioners Association of Western Australian supported 'a change in labelling for the reasons identified by the ALRC'. The Hunter Valley Family Law Practitioners Association submitted that legislation should contain a presumption of the kind recommended by the ALRC. The Family Law Practitioners Association of Queensland said that the legislation removed a 'presently known pathway' and questioned whether more cases would be 'initiated on the question of parental responsibility alone'. The Law Council of Australia acknowledged the divergence of views among the profession. Among its constituent body, some said the removal of the presumption would make it more difficult to explain the law, could increase litigation and costs incurred by parties, would discourage parents from attempting to consult with each other on decisions relating to the welfare of the child, and put Australia out of step with international peers. Such a significant divergence of views should give any sensible legislator pause for thought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is much more to be said about schedule 1 and particularly about how courts determine what is in the best interests of the child, but, in the interests of time, I will turn to other schedules. Schedule 2 is about the enforcement of child-related orders. The underlying purpose is to simplify a complex scheme. We agree it should be simplified. We think changes to the scheme should reduce costs and enhance compliance. But it remains to be seen whether schedule 2 will do this. The ACT Bar Association said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of the bill extends the definition of a relative for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children to include anyone who's considered a relative in that child's culture. We support this in principle, but the practical implications have not been fully considered. For example, it means that family violence includes violence amongst anyone who falls within the extended definition. It may be that the obligation to notify the court about family violence now applies to a much wider group. It is possible that people who are not involved in the court case at all could have their medical and police records subpoenaed. It may be that none of these are bad outcomes, but we just don't know how it would play out for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and communities. How will this provision affect parenting orders in Palm Island and Alice Springs? Is there any interplay with the child protection system? These issues need to be tested with communities on the grounds.</span>

Every year the Devenish Dookie and District Good Friday Appeal team raises money for the Royal Children's Hospital. They don't just raise money on the day; they do it throughout the year. They hold raffles, car shows and a lamb drive, and farmers raise and sell steers for the cause. Wayne and Floss Groves at the Gladstone Dookie Hotel put on a fortnightly meat tray, and a big highlight is the yabby racing on Australia Day. I had a starter in that this year, but it's still crawling!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year they raised $120,000, the second most of any regional community. To put that in context, the last census put the Dookie population at 333 and Devenish at 208. Ballarat was first—well done Ballarat, with its population of 100,000—but coming in second were two small farming communities with just over 500 people. That's a stunning effort. Over the past seven years, they've raised more than half a million dollars to help support sick children and their families. I say well done to Paul Durden and his team of volunteers and the many community groups, businesses and individuals who make such a great contribution year after year. I could not be more proud of everyone involved. You are what makes our community very special. </span>

Ahead of tonight's budget, the federal government plans to double the amount of medicines Australians can purchase, by allowing 60-day dispensing. However, experts have warned the move, which has been described as one of the biggest shake-ups the PBS has faced, could create significant medicine shortages and delays. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional, rural and remote Australians risk being impacted by the changes, which come into effect on 1 September. The government's policy cuts $3.5 billion out of community pharmacies, cutting vital services to patients. The impact of these cuts will affect small, rural and remote pharmacies, significantly resulting in the reduction of services and opening hours and, in some cases, in closures. The Albanese government must provide a strong guarantee that this change will not harm the viability of community pharmacies and, therefore, will not be another broken promise. Community pharmacies play an integral role in the provision of primary health care in Australia, particularly in rural and regional Australia, and we do not want to see any community pharmacies close as a result of these government actions. Australian patients deserve affordable, accessible and safe access to pharmacy services. This should be true whether you live in rural and remote Australia or in a metropolitan centre.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  Much of the focus today is, understandably, on the budget, but I want to acknowledge the extraordinary stress and emotional turmoil that families of Sudanese heritage everywhere, including in my electorate, are experiencing. A resilient people, they give back to this nation in so many ways. Take Mohamed Semra, who arrived here as a six-year-old with his mother and siblings after years in a refugee camp. Now 24, Mohamed is the co-founder of a social enterprise, Endeavour Youth Australia, which works in school to stamp out racism and develop the leaders of the future. His two brothers, both Australian citizens, remain trapped in Sudan. His sister-in-law is nine months pregnant and can't travel. The situation remains volatile and dangerous. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is deeply concerned by reports that more than 550 people have been killed and almost 5,000 injured since fighting began in Sudan on 15 April. Australia continues to work closely with international partners to evacuate Australians; some 237 Australians and their families have left Sudan. Huge efforts are also underway to provide humanitarian support. Of the $6 million in support recently announced, $1 million is for the International Committee of the Red Cross to provide medical supplies, food, water and emergency shelter. Australia continues to call on all parties to agree to a permanent cessation of hostilities. In the meantime, our thoughts remain with the Sudanese community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  Today I rise to table this petition, calling on the House to make changes to the Census and Statistics Act 1905 to legally mandate the inclusion of LGBTQIA+ people within the census. This petition has been considered by the Petitions Committee and found to be an order. It calls attention to the fact that the Australian Bureau of Statistics does not currently collect data on LGBTQIA+ people. I thank the petitioner, Evalyn Venture, who is in the gallery today, for all her work on gathering 4,946 signatures and bringing light to this issue.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The data collection omission by the ABS means that governments and support services are unable to understand the health and wellbeing needs of queer people. Therefore, they cannot sufficiently plan for both the development of policy and allocation of resources for LGBTQIA+ communities. In the 2021 census, the ABS failed to adequately collect data on transgender, non-binary and gender diverse people, conflating gender identity and sex. While it counted same-sex marriages and some LGBTQIA+ people who live with their partner, it failed to identify queer people who were not living with or married to their partner at the time. These omissions amount to our community's erasure by the government and the ABS, and it must change. They have the opportunity to change this policy in the lead-up to the 2026 census. They must take it; it is time to count us in.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In 2021, despite a campaign with the support of over 100 peak bodies, health experts, and community organisations; data collection about LGBTIQA+ Australians were dropped due to the conservative position of the Chief Statistician within the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This essentially means that neither the federal or state governments within Australia have any definitive data about lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and gender diverse, intersex, queer and other sexuality and bodily diverse Australians within their communities; or the intersectionality of this data with other factors such as health, income, culture, location, etc. The lack of current population-level data limits understanding of health and wellbeing needs of LGBTIQA+ people, and both the development of policy and allocation of resources for LGBTIQA+ communities</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to makes changes to the Census and Statistics Act 1905 to legally mandate the inclusion of LGBTIQA+ data within the census. The Chief Statistician's current authority to include this data per the Act "as he or she considers appropriate" subjects marginalised people such as LGBTIQA+ Australians to the personal bias of a singular individual. No one person has the right to say that a group of people are invalid and do not deserve to be counted, and this authority needs to be stripped away and replaced with statutory directives mandating the collection of this data.</span>

I had that great pleasure again when I visited Pearcedale Primary School to speak to the grade 6 cohort and host a Q&amp;A with them. I was joined by the fantastic state member for Bass, Jordan Crugnale, and we made an effective team in answering all questions related to federal and state governments. There were some fantastic questions, ranging from how our great democracy works all the way through to individual issues and which level of government looks after what. In fact, last Wednesday the grade 6 cohort were here in Canberra for an educational tour on how our parliament works, so they were quite prepared with their questions. There are some rising stars in this year level and I am so excited to see what they will achieve in their final year of primary school and beyond.</span>

One of those hidden secrets is Helico Australia where, inside an old hay shed on the outskirts of Alexandra, you will find a team of 18 staff repairing and rebuilding helicopters from all over the country. Helico specialises in the deep maintenance and rebuilds of Robinson helicopters, small choppers that are used predominantly for agricultural work such as mustering. Run by locals Hylke and Neri Kijlstra, over the last seven years Helico has gone from strength to strength, growing the number of locals employed and training 12 apprentices. Each apprenticeship takes four years of study and work, highlighting their commitment to upskilling young people and growing the next generation of the aviation industry.</span>

This is making the process of maintenance quicker and more cost efficient, with a better product at the end too. We need more employers like Hylke and Neri all over Australia, people who value their workers, their community and their industry and look at the bigger picture. I say to the jobs and skills minister, the industry minister and the transport minister: come to Indi and meet Hylke and Neri. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I know through doorknocking and speaking with people in Narara and across the Central Coast that there is a high level of interest and excitement for our rollout of 400 community batteries. Stream 1 of this funding will go towards 58 community batteries overseen by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. Narara will be one of these first 58 locations to receive a battery.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Community batteries are a part of the Albanese Labor government's Powering Australia plan and aim to reduce pressure on our energy infrastructure. As Australia transitions to a renewable energy future, community batteries will play an integral part in supporting the energy system. They will help share solar energy across our community and across the Central Coast. They will help regulate the network and improve quality, and I look forward to this program continuing to power ahead. I encourage the people living in Narara and across the Central Coast to provide feedback on the proposed location for our community battery. I want to thank Minister Bowen, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy, for his leadership on this matter and this project.</span>

                  </a>  Professor Brighthope, who practised and taught medicine for 45 years, is scathing in his assessment of Australia's management of the COVID pandemic, saying the vaccine is killing and maiming too many Australians and that he is completely disgusted that prevention and early treatments had been deliberately cast aside by medical bureaucrats in 2020. Even Channel 7 ran a story last night with the headline 'COVID nightmare: the crippling side-effects'. If I were a doctor, in light of current litigation overseas, I'd be checking right now whether the government's 2021 assurance that doctors would not be liable was a hollow gesture because, unlike the vaccine manufacturers who are indemnified by our government, the letter to Elizabeth Hart states that no such indemnity scheme was established for medical professionals administering the COVID vaccines.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the TGA is no longer interfering with doctors' rights to prescribe ivermectin off label, and that the AstraZeneca vaccine, which caused blood clots and was associated with unprecedented notifications to the TGA, has been quietly discontinued. I was especially pleased to hear two former colleagues, Peter Costello and John Anderson, speaking up last week that Australia had gone way too far during the pandemic. Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to address the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  Australia is a nation with a degree of social cohesion that is the envy of the world, a place we like to think that people can live their lives authentically. And yet, in amongst the colourful, interlaced fibres of our communities, there are forces that try to marginalise and divide us along gender identity lines. As a doctor I looked after people from all walks of life. People were treated without judgement within those hospital wards, which is why I find it perplexing to encounter anti-gender-diverse sentiment in our community. It is alien to me, but sadly far too common outside those hospital wards. Transgender people, including gender-diverse and non-binary people, are a marginalised group who are far more susceptible to mental health impacts and health disparities. Gender dysphoria is a complex health issue, requiring expert multidisciplinary care.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the introduction of our 10-year national action plan for the health and wellbeing of LGBTQI+ people, I want to assure the community that inclusion is core business for the Albanese government. We do this to ensure that everyone is able to live a healthy, productive life where they can be their true selves. Let us be champions of respect and dismantle the systemic and social barriers that encase our hearts and infect our community. Respect should be universal. Let it multiply.</span>

Obviously Spencer Gulf is in South Australia and the Parkes electorate is in New South Wales, but it was the only TV news that was going into Broken Hill. Broken Hill is the second-largest town in the Parkes electorate. It runs on central time. It's right on the South Australian border. Without any warning, the staff were notified with one day's notice that the programs would be ceased, the journalist in Broken Hill was laid off, and now Broken Hill has no nightly news program that's relevant to that community.</span>

It has a strong background as the home, largely, of the union movement in New South Wales, and it is now having a resurgence with cobalt and magnetite. It's been discovered by tourists during the pandemic. We've got the Mundi Mundi Bash, where 16,000 people at a time come to the far west.</span>

It follows on from some of the decisions made by the corporate newspaper owners that have withdrawn their services from regional Australia, and we've been left swinging.</span>

It's an upgrade that'll help ease traffic congestion and reduce travel times. After 12 years of unfulfilled promises by former governments, I'm proud to be part of a government that will deliver this much-needed upgrade. Importantly, we will deliver it alongside our new state colleagues in the Minns Labor government. I'm pleased to report that the contract to start design work for the widening of the bridge has been awarded. It will lead to a period of community consultation on the final design next year and construction after that. The upgrades will see the bridge widened in both directions, including the addition of wider footpaths for pedestrian safety. It'll have a new central median and safety screens along the bridge.</span>

There are too many people killed and injured on our regional road network, and Gippsland motorists right now are being robbed of life-saving road upgrades because state and federal government bureaucrats are failing to do their jobs. Now we have the minister threatening to take money away from our region.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're expected in Victoria to drive roadworthy cars, but the Premier, Dan Andrews, has failed to provide car-worthy roads. He doesn't even spend the money when it's provided by the federal government for life-saving road projects. The arterial road network owned by the state government is falling apart, and it's costing lives right across our state.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To make it worse, we've had tens of millions of dollars in federal government funding from the previous federal government allocated to our region, but a failure to fast-track the design process has meant that roadworks often don't start until years after the commitment is actually made. Now we have Minister Catherine King threatening, in a review that she announced last week, to withdraw money from projects that haven't started, so in essence we have communities which are at risk of being punished by the federal Labor government because the state Labor government has failed to do its job and deliver the road safety projects that we've funded. Minister King needs to understand that saving lives through investment in better arterial roads and highways is a job for all levels of government. Our message to Minister King is that your review, underway right now, must quarantine road safety projects from any cuts, because if you fix country roads you will save country lives.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  Round 6 of the Mobile Black Spot Program under this government is an absolute disgrace and an absolute rort. Let's recap what we know. We know that the minister admitted to Ben Fordham on radio 2GB in April that she picked 54 out of 54 locations that got funding under this program. Not one was based on advice from the department—54 out of 54 were picked by the minister. We know that even though the Labor Party only holds a third of seats in regional Australia, guess what? Seventy-four per cent of the locations that the minister picked were in Labor electorates. Guess what else we know? In New South Wales and Victoria, of the 30 locations that she picked, 100 per cent were in Labor electorates. It's an absolute disgrace.</span>

This program must be done on the basis of need, not on the basis of the Labor Party's political benefits. The Auditor-General wrote to me last week in response to my request for an investigation into this program and said that he sees merit in a potential audit, and I certainly hope and look forward to that occurring because the program is a disgrace.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the measures that I am particularly proud to see in our first big May budget is increasing the age that people can stay on parenting payment to until their youngest child turns 14. This decision will be welcomed by single parents, by women's organisations, by charity groups and by organisations supporting families who find themselves in this situation. It will be welcomed by them. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking to a dad in my electorate a few years ago, he had tragically lost his wife to cancer and he was making this tough decision whether to quit work to help raise his three boys. They were dealing with grief and then dealing with the prospect of how they would pay the bills now that they had lost their two income earners. What this measure does is actually give single parents the choice. In households where you have two parents, you do have choice. You decide whether two parents go to work, whether a parent stays home, and who's going to have the caring responsibilities. What this measure does is ensure that if a single parent decides to stay at home with their children and do all of the running around, they won't be doing it living in poverty.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  I'd like to acknowledge a member of my community who, at 91 years old, continues to prove that nothing beats good, old-fashioned grit, dedication and life experience. Campdrafting legend John Stanton has been taking out titles for over 70 years, having won his first campdraft competition in 1946. In 1954 he was selected to ride as a buckjumper on the previously completely unridden feature horse at the Royal Easter Show for Queen Elizabeth II, where he was offered 25 pounds by the show committee if he managed to stay on the horse. He conceded that he was 'probably selected because they didn't think they'd have to pay the money'. Well, they had to pay it in full. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was awarded the Warwick Gold Cup in 2017 for his lifelong contribution to the sport. At the time he was quoted as saying: 'While I can pull my boots on, I want to keep going. And, when the day comes that I can't get out of bed and pull my own boots on, I'll be prepared to hand my number plates in.' Recently at the local Macksville Show, just a couple of weeks ago, at 91, he took out the cut-out title, beating other competitors less than half his age. It looks like those old boots have got plenty of kick in them still, John. Many thanks to the organisers of the Macksville Show and all the competitors. Also, John, I'll see you next year. You're a legend.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  South Australia's wine industry is kicking goals. Our wines are world renowned and a major export industry for the state. Fifty per cent of all wines bottled in Australia come from South Australia and 80 per cent of all premium Australian wines come from South Australia. Boothby is a suburban seat but it's also home to the family owned Patritti wines. Founded in 1926, it produces a range of very nice wines—I recommend the rose—and their cellar door in Dover Gardens, with live music, is very much worth a visit. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have another wine industry secret in Boothby: the Australian Wine Research Institute at the Waite Campus of the University of Adelaide. I recently toured this facility and saw students at work learning how to make wine and the research labs where scientists isolate the compounds that produce specific flavours and analyse the impact of smoke taint. But the most interesting part of their work is the development of the NOLO industry: no-alcohol and low-alcohol wines. They are working to make these products' taste and texture indistinguishable from good quality wine—not like water plus additives. I have no doubt they'll get there and will open up yet another great export industry for Australia. We know that the demand, both across Australia and overseas, for no-alcohol and low-alcohol wine is just growing. Many thanks to Managing Director Mark Krstic.</span>

But all of tonight's hugs and backslapping can't disguise the reality that this Prime Minister and his government are failing to get on top of this worsening cost-of-living crisis. The price of everything continues to go up. Gas and household fuels are up 14.3 per cent. Tertiary education is up over 14 per cent. Domestic travel costs are up 4.7 per cent. The cost of essentials like fruit and vegetables is rising to the point that more Australians are turning to cheaper, canned alternatives. Lifeline says up to 80 per cent of its calls relate to cost-of-living pressures. Forty-five per cent of Australians say they're delaying essential repairs and servicing of their cars. More than three-quarters of Australians say they are extremely, or very, concerned about the cost of living. The National Youth Mental Health Survey notes the cost of living as 'the single biggest concern for young Australians'.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the last election, the Prime Minister promised that Australians would be better off, with cheaper mortgages and $275 off their power bills. Instead, millions of Australians are struggling to make ends meet. Inflation is a cruel force which hurts us all. A big-spending budget which fuels inflation is the last thing Australians need right now.</span>

I know that families in my electorate of Pearce in Western Australia will wholeheartedly welcome the many measures that will provide cost-of-living relief. We have committed a $2.2 billion package to strengthening Medicare and measures to make health care more accessible and affordable. We are making medicines cheaper and easier to access, a welcome move for all Australians who rely on medications. We are making it easier for Australians to see a doctor when they need to by improving after-hours access to primary care. We have committed $11.3 billion over four years to fund the outcome of the Fair Work Commission's record 15 per cent pay rise for 250,000 aged-care workers across the country from 1 July 2023. We are extending the financial safety net for thousands of single parents. </span>

I do note that some in the media perhaps haven't noticed that that's what we do as members of the House of Representatives and of the Senate and as ministers, because that seemed to be controversial while I was in London—something that should not have been.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the member for Aston joins us in the work of building a better future. It is the first time a government candidate has won a seat from the opposition in over 100 years. She is already the best member for Aston in over 30 years! And she is the newest member of a government working today, and every day, to deliver the positive plan that Australians voted for in 2022.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I rang Mary and asked her to be the candidate in the by-election, she had, of course, already contested an election back in 2022 and achieved an outstanding result, standing for an electorate that had received 54.7 per cent of the primary vote for the former member for Aston, Alan Tudge, and a two-party preferred vote of over 60 per cent for the coalition. Mary achieved an outstanding result in 2022, and we were hopeful that we could maintain that result. She went much better than expectations could possibly have planned for, and she did that because of who she is. Mary is someone who grew up in public housing, a mum and carer to three beautiful children, a mortgage holder who knows the pressure that's there on family budgets, a working parent who has seen the punishing cost of child care, a cancer survivor who knows the true meaning of Medicare, and a proud citizen of the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne who cares about her community and cares about the local environment. And Mary Doyle is a person driven by the oldest and deepest Australian aspiration—the aspiration for a better life and a greater opportunity for the next generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the member for Aston: I am very confident that you will continue to be a strong voice for your local community. And I am delighted that you are joining us here on budget day, with the great privilege of serving the people of Australia that all of us have from our different perspectives. I've got to know you personally and seen you grow, particularly in that period under the pressure that comes with being a by-election candidate, where the focus of the media on Aston was far greater, it's fair to say, than it probably was in the 2022 election. I saw you grow as a person, and the Australian people, but particularly the people of Aston, saw the character that you showed. For those people who were watching on election night, when you were introduced by the Deputy Prime Minister as the successful candidate, I think your humility showed, your character showed and your passionate commitment for that local community showed. And I am certain that you will bring that diligence, that commitment and that perseverance to representing the good people of Aston in this parliament and beyond. You are someone who has created history; that can't be taken away from you. But I look forward to the future history that you're going to create over many years as the member for Aston. I congratulate you on behalf of the government, very sincerely, on being sworn in today as the member for Aston.</span>

My question is to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister promised Australians cheaper mortgages, but since his election interest rates have gone up 10 times—the fastest rise in history. The Prime Minister promised before the election a $275 cut to your power bill each year, but Labor's intervention in the gas market is causing prices to skyrocket. The Prime Minister promised families would be better off, but the cost-of-living crisis has never been worse. Why do Australians always pay more under Labor?</span>

We did promise and we are delivering on making a difference to people. We are making a difference with the cheaper medicines policy that we brought in on 1 January. We are making an enormous difference, contrasting with the person who asked the question, who, when he was health minister, wanted to jack up the price of essential medicines by $5 per script. There's a contrast. Cheaper child care starts from 1 July. When the legislation was carried, the shadow finance minister said this: 'It's certainly not the policy that we would have introduced.' Never a truer word was said! On 1 July we're extending paid parental leave to six months. The Leader of the Opposition was a senior minister in the former government, which repeatedly tried to cut government funded paid parental leave for tens of thousands of families.</span>

This is the first question I've ever got from a member for Aston; the previous member was mute for the entire term! Tonight's budget will be a responsible budget. Stronger foundations for a better future—that is what we will be providing tonight, cleaning up the mess that we inherited. Gross debt was predicted in the previous government's budget, and I remind them that we've been in office for less than one year. In 2022, their budget predicted that, this year, gross debt would be $977 billion, almost $1 trillion. They projected a deficit of 3.4 per cent of GDP, or $77.9 billion, for this year. I'll make a bold prediction—without stealing the Treasurer's thunder tonight—that it'll be a bit better than that. I'll make that bold prediction.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They had $7½ billion of unfunded and terminating measures over the forward estimates. That is what we were left with—a booby trapped budget that didn't plan for the future. This time last year, those opposite handed down a budget without a single dollar in savings—not one. But they had a whole lot of expenditure out there, most of which just disappeared as soon as people cast their votes. Their focus was just on the election. Our focus is on the needs of the Australian people: making sure that we look after the vulnerable and those doing it tough, making sure that we strengthen Medicare, and making sure that we deal with the skills crisis that we inherited.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight's budget will be about helping people who are struggling to make ends meet, while not adding to inflation. It will be about dealing with the immediate challenges but investing in the medium and long term as well. It will be about providing affordable, effective and targeted cost-of-living relief, delivering historic investments in Medicare and health, supporting vulnerable Australians, growing the economy and strengthening the budget to make our finances more secure for the future.</span>

                  </a>  Indeed, I do use it each and every day. I use it to know that, indeed, inflation had taken off well before Labor took office. Indeed, the largest quarterly rise this century was—guess when? March 2022. The largest rise in inflation of any quarter this century was on their watch—the last quarter in which they were in office. That is the starting point that my government inherited: a 2.1 per cent jump in one quarter. If you do a bit of maths—you don't need an economics degree—2.1 over a quarter times four equals a pretty high inflation rate. That is what they were dealing with, and that is what we have had to deal with.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the election, it emerged that the Morrison government had ignored Treasury warnings, and it used its final budget to unleash a desperate vote-buying spending spree. They added fuel to the inflation fire. A former government source described it as 'ordering the entree, the main and the dessert'. It was all there. All the one-off payments and the cash payments were there—not worrying about the impact.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, Australians always pay more under the coalition. We know that the highest-taxing government was the Howard government and the second-highest-taxing government was that of Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison. The budget papers accompanying their final budget last year showed no surpluses over the forwards; instead, the coalition were on track to rack up $224 billion in additional borrowings over just four years. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational </span><span style="font-style:italic;">report</span> showed the budget would not be in surplus in any year between now and 2060.

On 31 March 2021, a day after the Leader of the Opposition had just become Australia's defence minister, he announced that the former government was to establish an industrial base in this country for the manufacture of guided weapons. This was done in the finest traditions and with all the hoopla of a Morrison government announcement. Indeed, the member for Cook was on the press release, where he said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, having the ability for self-reliance, be it vaccine development or the defence of Australia, is vital to meeting our own requirements in a changing global environment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know what they didn't do with vaccines, and they weren't much better when it came to the defence of Australia. The press release also said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Strategic Policy Institute has estimated that Australia will spend $100 billion in the next 20 years on missile and guided weapons purchases.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It promised the creation of 2,000 high-tech jobs in Australia—although, under the scrutiny of Senate estimates, it turns out that that number was not based on any advice from the Department of Defence; in fact, it was completely made up. The reality of that announcement was very different. Only $1 billion was committed, not nearly enough to see this get going, and the time frame for the beginning of manufacturing guided weapons in this country was not to happen until 2027, a full six years after this announcement was made—promises on the never-never, all fanfare, no follow-up, all announcement, no delivery. On his first full day in the job as Australia's defence minister he sold this country a fantasy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is very different. Announcements are one matter, but we ask to be judged on our outcomes. Over the last couple of weeks we've committed $2.5 billion to the establishment of a guided weapons enterprise in this country. We've already appointed a three-star officer, Air Vice-Marshal Leon Phillips, to oversee that enterprise, and this is all part of the Defence Strategic Review, which was released on 24 April, the first retasking of our Defence Force in more than 35 years. At the heart of that retasking is giving our Defence Force the capacity for impactful protection, which is why establishing a guided weapons enterprise forms one of our six initial priorities to the Defence Strategic Review, because this is exactly the capability our nation needs to keep Australians safe.</span>

During the last election campaign you identified climate change as the greatest threat to our national security. In May 2022 your government committed to an urgent climate risk assessment by the Office of National Intelligence to help us understand the security risk of climate change. You've had that report since November. Why hasn't it been released, and when will we see it?</span>

This government has brought a heightened degree of transparency, when it comes to climate change, to this parliament and to this country. One of the most important things we've done is enshrined in law, in the Climate Change Act, that the climate change minister must report annually to parliament on progress against targets and on all other matters relating to climate change and to policies. That is something we're proud to have done. I've delivered the first climate change statement and will deliver the second later this year. This is a very important addition to transparency.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to national security, we do say that climate change is a very real and significant issue in our national security. That's why the Prime Minister appointed me to the National Security Committee of Cabinet, for example—to make sure that that is represented around the national security table. In relation to the national security statement, of course, matters that are classified in relation to advice to the Prime Minister and the National Security Committee are treated accordingly. But we have brought that level of transparency, and I'm happy to provide further updates to the House accordingly.</span>

I know she cares very deeply about this and is very deeply engaged in lifting the standard of aged care in this country, and I thank her for continuing to work shoulder to shoulder with me on that. The Albanese government is proud to be delivering the largest ever pay rise for aged-care workers in history. After nine years of workforce neglect from those opposite, Labor has made a record investment in our workforce.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our commitment helps more than 250,000 workers across this country, and it means that nurses can earn an extra $10,000 a year. It means that personal-care workers can earn an extra $7,000 a year. That is what valuing workers looks like. That is what care looks like. That is what doing something meaningful to address workforce shortages actually looks like. I have visited 30 aged-care homes in the 11 months that I have been the minister, and the no. 1 issue raised with me is staff shortages. We said that we would address the mess left behind by those opposite, and now our budget commits $11.3 billion to addressing their workforce crisis.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this wage rise impacts more than just our tireless and skilled workers. It improves the lives of those who receive aged care as well. They are just as thrilled for their workers as we are. On the weekend I met home-care recipient Rachel, 91 years young, while doorknocking in my electorate of Lilley. Rachel uses a home-care package, and she had her nurse, Elle, from Burnie Brae over when they watched the Treasurer and I make the announcement on TV last Thursday morning. Rachel said Elle actually shouted out loud, and you could hear her from Bribie Island, because Elle has three kids, and this announcement, that she was getting an extra $200 a week, meant she could buy her kids new shoes for sport. That is what this announcement does. Workers like Elle and care recipients like Rachel are why we committed to this record spend.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr SHORTEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Minister for Government Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:33</span>):  On 24 November last year, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> disturbingly reported that de facto Canberra lobbying firm Synergy 360 received secret advice from the member for Fadden. I ordered a review into the contracts which may have been tainted. As has been made clear by agency task force representatives and the reviewer, Dr Watt, the review was limited to only looking into the conduct of public servants and not that of vendors, former ministers, MPs and their officers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 14 April this year, the JCPAA, chaired by the member for Bruce, held public hearings into the findings of the Watt review. The member for Fadden's former business partner, political fundraiser and part-owner of Synergy 360, Mr John Margerison, gave evidence. The chair's first question to Mr Margerison was: 'What's APUT?' Mr Margerison was asked by the chair what APUT was. He replied—and I quote from the transcript:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's the Australian Property Trust. It's a unit trust.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The chair then read aloud an email Mr Margerison sent to his Gold Coast accountant, Mr Sean Beasley, about directing who was to receive the profits from Synergy 360. The transcript reads:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On 13 September 2017, you emailed your accountant, Mr Beasley, and advised him: 'FYI, anything that comes in from this in the future, I will end up sending to APUT—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">the Property Trust—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">the same amount that comes in.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Margerison went on to say that the trust that he controlled was, according to his instruction to his accountant, to direct profits from the consulting company derived from Commonwealth contracts. This property trust had as one of its beneficiaries the member for Fadden. I quote the transcript where Mr Margerison explains the member for Fadden's pecuniary interest in the Property Trust receiving profits from Commonwealth contracts. It reads:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I had a business relationship with Mr Robert at one point in time. That finished around about, give or take, the end of 2018. He would have been a unit holder through whatever mechanism, whether it be his family trust or personally … up until … that time, give or take.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Money derived from Commonwealth contracts was being funnelled through to a member of parliament. The evidence presented to the committee is crystal clear. We know that in a few weeks the member for Fadden is leaving the Australian parliament. The evidence is crystal clear. The question for the member for Fadden and the Leader of the Opposition is: did the member ever, directly or indirectly, seek to or receive a financial benefit from Synergy 360 and is there still a potential benefit owed to him? A further question for the Leader of the Opposition is: do you endorse the conduct of the member for Fadden in light of the evidence that we've heard?</span>

When it comes to pressure on inflation one of the things that a government can do is make sure that when it hands down a budget it is fiscally responsible. Tonight you'll see the response of the government that I'm proud to lead. To be fair to the member for Flinders, she wasn't here to see, quite frankly, the debacle that occurred towards the end of the long office of the Morrison, Abbott and Turnbull governments where we saw the law of diminishing returns—to use an economic term for the benefit of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. We saw that in place—absolutely.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Social Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:40</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Fraser for that question and for his fierce advocacy for families in his electorate. I'd like to thank many of my Labor colleagues and, indeed, many on the crossbench as well, for their advocacy on boosting support for single parents. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday the Prime Minister announced that this government will expand the eligibility for the single-parent payment by increasing the age cut-off from when the youngest child turns eight to when the youngest child turns 14. This will provide 57,000 low-income single parents with an additional $176.90 per fortnight. This measure will strengthen Australia's safety net and, as the Prime Minister yesterday, is an investment in families. It recognises that many single parents—overwhelmingly women—have a lot to juggle. The juggle doesn't change when the child turns eight. Our change means that parents will continue to receive a higher payment during the later primary school years and through the critical transition to high school. As children get older the demands on parenting don't go away but they do evolve. Single parents are in a much stronger position to take on more paid work as their children get older, but they do need support to get there. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge the work by Terese Edwards of the Council of Single Mothers and Sam Mostyn AO of the Women's Economic Equality Taskforce, who put significant work into their report and who also welcomed yesterday's announcement. They said the reform will allow those who qualify for the payment to be better parents and to unlock their untapped economic potential. Both of these women have been consistent and constructive in their advocacy on particular challenges facing single parents, most of whom are women. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased that our changes have been warmly welcomed by many advocates and stakeholders, including The Parenthood and the Australian Council of Social Service, who have both called this measure life-changing. The Australian Council of Social Service said that 'restoration of the parenting payment was a key recommendation of the Women's Economic Equality Taskforce' and that the government's changes were 'incredibly welcome'. The Parenthood also said that this change, along with the abolition of the ParentsNext program, 'will greatly help thousands of vulnerable children and parents, most mothers, and allow them to have greater financial freedom and flexibility'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our change will ensure single parents have the safety net they need. Our government is focused on families dealing with the day-to-day financial pressures, while creating more economic security for them over the long-term. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

He's embarrassed by the fact that they never landed a single one. You know what? I've got 101 renewable energy projects before me right now, and I am delighted by the fact that we've got more renewable energy projects coming in all the time, because renewable energy is good for the environment. It's good for Australian households. It's good for Australian businesses. Dealing with climate change is one of the best things that we can do for the Australian environment.

Indeed, in the United Kingdom, along with Prime Minister Sunak, last week I announced that the free trade agreement would come into force on 31 May. That follows the final parliamentary processes being completed in the UK just last week and our processes being completed before parliament rose at the end of last year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This FTA opens up new opportunities and delivers significant benefits for Australian businesses and consumers, for Australian farmers and for Australian workers and travellers. It will lift our entire economy. It will eliminate tariffs on nearly all exports to the United Kingdom, making an enormous difference. I was at the Bondi Green cafe there in London, one of 14 as part of a business that's been established over the last decade, providing the best food, produce and wine that Australia can produce to UK customers. That is a good thing. What it will do is enable the price of those to be decreased substantially, but it will also make it easier for Australians to work in the UK, raising the working holiday visa age from 30 to 35 and increasing the maximum stay from two years to three years. It will eliminate tariffs on imports from the UK. This will reduce costs to households and businesses and will, therefore, have a deflationary impact on our economy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Together with the historic AUKUS partnership, we're strengthening our relationship with a longstanding partner and friend. I had the privilege of going with the Defence secretary of state up to Barrow to look at their manufacturing of submarines that occurs there, and that is where I met Australian workers who are already being trained there. The relationships we are building with countries around the world are vital to Australia's strategic interests and to a thriving economy at home. In addition, I met with leaders of the European Union, on the sidelines of the coronation, to see in what way we could advance the Australia-EU free trade agreement. A lot of work is going into that because that has significant potential benefits for Australia into the future.</span>

One of the things that we have done, as a government, is to reduce what we regarded as an overreliance on consultants. We have made sure—and you'll see in tonight's budget the contrast which is there—that we have put on additional public servants to deal with the challenges that we had with the backlog in visas of one million people, to make sure that we deal with issues in government services, which would have dropped off the shelf if we hadn't extended funding to services like myGov beyond 30 June, which were due to end. We've made sure, as will be reflected tonight as well, that we have indicated to the Public Service, by every single one of my ministers not just talking to the secretary of their departments but talking to their whole departments, encouraging ideas to come up, encouraging that frank and fearless advice to come to government so that, as we go forward, we maximise the respect and the capacity of the Public Service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do that personally as well. On any occasion when I visited the UK, we had a meeting with the High Commissioner for all of the staff at the High Commission—the staff who work in Defence, the staff who work in Home Affairs, the staff who work in Immigration, the staff who work in Trade and the staff who work in Foreign Affairs and diplomatic advice as well. It is, to me, common courtesy; if you treat people with respect, you will get better outcomes. We also have the same approach towards their income and treating them with respect when it comes to proper negotiations between the government and public servants, through their union, to make sure that respect is shown.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former government did receive some advice about the issue that has come to light when it comes to the Tax Practitioners Board. Indeed, the measures that were there from a review into the Tax Practitioners Board were given to the government of the day in 2019. But, like so much else, nothing happened. My government is committed to implementing the recommendations of that review.</span>

                  </a>  We acted by capping the price of coal and gas. That was controversial then and it is controversial now. The Leader of the Opposition today, just in question time earlier, claimed that capping the price of gas had forced prices up. Maybe the Leader of the Opposition should have gone to the University of Sydney to get an economics degree! Maybe we'd all be better off if that had happened, because he thinks that lower coal and gas prices lead to higher energy prices. But we've done that and it's had an impact. We've seen that impact in the draft Default Market Offer released earlier this year: 29 percentage points lower than it otherwise would have been. As Clare Savage, the Energy Regulator, has made clear, that is in large part due to the impact of the intervention by the Albanese government. That has saved up to $1,676 for a Victorian small business each year. It's saved up to $530 for a household, particularly South Australian households. Of course, we know we need to do more and tonight we will be doing more.</span>

                  </a>  The same legislation which enabled that intervention to cap the price of coal and gas enables direct rebates to Australian families and businesses—carefully designed to put downward pressure on inflation by reducing power prices directly, compared to what they would have been. I'm pleased to confirm that 5½ million households and a million businesses will benefit from that action. The Treasurer will, of course, outline more action this evening.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's a third element as well. We understand, on this side of the House, that reducing emissions and reducing bills are the same thing. We understand that if you make a house or a business more efficient, you reduce bills as well as emissions, and we happen to think that's a good thing. Call us old fashioned but on this side of the House we think that reducing bills and reducing emissions is a good thing. We know that Australia ranks 58th out of 63 on energy efficiency of households. We can do better. In particular, lower- and middle-income household need that support. So, again, we will see tonight strong action to help households reduce their bills and emissions, particularly for those who need assistance and particularly for small business. We've already announced our tax treatment of energy efficient investments by small business which will benefit hundreds of thousands of small businesses across the country who want to reduce their emissions and reduce their bills, and we're going to help them do it.</span>

                  </a>  I note the member for Penrith is there in the parliament on her first sitting day today, as the first day of the Minns Labor government, and I congratulate all the members who've been elected there. At that press conference the member for Penrith was kind enough to remind me that she was a recruit of the Labor Party many years ago.</span>

It was on their watch, and the member for Lindsay doesn't have the same excuse as the member for Flinders, because she was here when that was happening. Those opposite will see tonight a plan to assist vulnerable Australians: as the member for Kingston has just outlined, the plan to help single parents, to make a substantial difference to them; the plans as well that we have to help small business—I note that the Canterbury Bankstown Chamber of Commerce are here in the gallery today, including John Khoury, the chairman of the Bulldogs. Welcome, and I thank the National Rugby League for their endorsement of constitutional recognition for Aboriginal Australians that they, along with other groups in civil society, have announced today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we will have support for small business. We will have support for families. We'll have support for those who need health care. We'll have support to lift wages in the aged-care sector. We'll have further support confirmed for child care that comes in on 1 July. We will have a budget that provides support for people who need it whilst not putting pressure on inflation—unlike those opposite, who didn't provide any support for people, except for their mates, and put increased pressure on inflation. That's the contrast. That's why this group here have been elected on good economic management, and that's what we're delivering. <span style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired)</span></span>

I know how hard she campaigned in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne on our promise to make medicines cheaper, and our government are delivering on that promise. Just last July we slashed the maximum amount that pensioners and concession card holders would pay for their medicines across a given year by 25 per cent, and in September we cut the price of 2,000 brands of medicine, putting $130 million back into the pockets of hardworking Australians. As everyone in this House knows, on 1 January we delivered the biggest cut to the price of medicines in the 75-year history of the PBS, putting more than $200 million every single year back into the pockets of hardworking Australian patients.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is more that the government can and the government should be doing here. Over summer the peak medicines experts, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, advised our government that more than 300 common medicines for chronic disease should be able to be supplied for 60 days rather than the current maximum of 30 days. This would bring us into line with pretty much every country to which we usually compare ourselves: the UK, New Zealand, Canada, France, Germany and so many others besides. It would halve the number of times those patients would have to visit the GP to get a routine repeat script, freeing up millions of GP consults, which everyone in this House knows is desperately needed. It would halve the cost of those common medicines for six million Australian patients living with chronic disease—medicines for blood pressure, heart disease, cholesterol, Crohn's disease and so much more. Overseas evidence tells us that this extra dispensing arrangement will increase medication compliance by up to 20 per cent. The AMA said this is a win for patients, ultimately delivering better health outcomes and taking pressure off the health system. This is good for the hip pockets of Australian patients, and it's good for their health as well, which is why a long list of patient groups—</span>

                  </a>  It is not for the first time that government has got this advice, because five years ago the former government got the same advice from the same advisory committee, and, instead of choosing the interest of patients, they chose to do nothing. Over those five years, hundreds of millions of dollars have been paid by patients when their medicines' experts told them they didn't have to.</span>

One of your arguments for last year's IR reforms was the need to increase wages for childcare workers. Six months later, no multi-employer bargains have been completed, childcare workers don't have commitments to increase wages and some childcare centres in Wentworth, like the one I saw last week, are only offering half the places because of staff shortages. Wouldn't it have been better to fix the awards and make a difference to families and workers now?</span>

I'll go through a couple of different issues that are raised. First of all, in terms of the award review, which was something that the member for Wentworth sought during the debate and was ultimately negotiated with the Senate as well with Senator Pocock, there are further discussions happening now about the nature of that award review. The review of the awards is in particular in the context of the new objectives in the act, and those objectives go both to secure employment and to gender equality, which obviously is particularly significant for the rates of pay for people who are working as early childhood educators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of multi-employer bargaining, the different parts of the act commence on different dates. The multi-employer provisions haven't started yet, so the reason why no multi-employer agreements have been concluded for early childhood education is those sections of the act don't commence until June. What we have seen, though, is exactly what I predicted in the sense that, immediately, we have seen a whole lot of employers come back to the table on individual enterprise agreements with their workforce, workplace by workplace. Our preference is always that you get individual workplaces negotiating and having those agreements in place. That's always the best option, but the problem has been, in a whole lot of feminised sectors, that hasn't worked. That's why we needed to open up the rules for multi-employer bargaining. They commence in June, so right now we're in a phase where we're seeing a really serious acceleration in the number of negotiations that are happening for enterprise agreements, and I expect, the moment that the laws start to open up in June, that's when we will logically see an increase in the engagement with multi-employer bargaining.</span>

                  </a>  She's doing it even now. Can I just say thank you very much to the member for Gilmore for the question. She knows just how important infrastructure investments are for our regions and for our cities. But, more importantly, she knows how important it is that when you promise to deliver infrastructure, it is actually delivered. That is why reforming the $120 billion infrastructure investment pipeline is so incredibly important. The previous government left this pipeline in a total mess, riddled with projects that were simply underfunded, had no funding partner, had not actually had proper cost-benefit analysis done and had not got the support of the states and territories. They were poorly scoped and were simply unable to be delivered. We saw the pipeline grow from 150 projects to 800 projects, a large number of which were under $50 million and simply could never be delivered.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the previous government somehow thought that they were going to deliver every single one of those 800 projects that were poorly funded, under scoped and not supported by the states and territories, then they had rocks in their heads. That is why we have had to look closely at this infrastructure investment pipeline. We want to make sure that if we promise a project, we actually deliver the project. That is what our regions deserve, it's what our rural communities deserve and it's what our cities absolutely deserve.</span>

There were election campaigns on! That's the way in which those opposite used public money in infrastructure to invest in projects that suited their political purposes right the way across the country—so they could put out a press release. I've said before that you cannot drive on a press release!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are doing the hard work of cleaning up the mess that those opposite left an incredibly important part of this budget in. One hundred and twenty billion dollars has to be delivered through the infrastructure investment pipeline, and it can only be delivered if we look at every project. We will look at the cost of those projects and make sure that we can actually deliver them—that we have funding partners for them. We are cleaning up the mess that has been left by those opposite, to make sure that we can deliver infrastructure in our rural communities, in our regions and right the way across our thriving and growing suburbs.</span>

My constituent Robert Withers lives in Port Macquarie, in my electorate of Cowper. His recent electricity bill showed that he had reduced his usage by 10 per cent from the same period last year. However, the charges have risen by 40 per cent. The Prime Minister promised Australians, like Robert, that he would cut their power bills by $275, but Robert is now $800 out of pocket in real terms. Why do Australians always pay more under Labor?</span>

You'll see a government that's absolutely committed to providing cost-of-living relief for people who are most vulnerable and who need it. That's what you'll see tonight, and you'll see it in a way that puts downward pressure on inflation and doesn't increase it. That's what a responsible government, dealing with the global challenge of inflation, is bound to do. And what we will do as well going forward is make sure that we are focused on that short term, but always with an eye and a strategy for the medium and long term. That's what our policy on climate is about, cheaper, cleaner energy driving new industries, driving new manufacturing, along with our skills policy to provide people with the employment to do it. That's the 'what'. Indeed, those opposite are so focused on themselves, when they look at each other they just ask themselves, 'Why indeed?'</span>

Keeping Australians safe is the core priority of the Albanese government, and that includes online safety, which has traditionally been an area of bipartisanship. This government is now undertaking the substantive work to ensure that the Online Safety Act is successfully implemented together with our regulator, the eSafety Commissioner. ESafety provides critical support to Australians who experience online abuse. Just to give you some sense of scale, since 1 July last year eSafety has provided support to children, parents and schools in response to over 1,200 complaints under its Cyberbullying Scheme. ESafety also received over 6,000 reports of image based abuse and completed over 12,000 investigations in relation to illegal and restricted content.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The eSafety Commissioner is also dealing with new and emerging online harms, including challenges posed by generative AI, which can be used to make what are called deepfakes. When generated with malice, deepfakes can be incredibly harmful. It's particularly concerning to hear about this technology being used to target women, who we know are more likely to experience online abuse that is personal, sexualised and violent. eSafety has powers to remove deepfake images that constitute image based abuse. As these technologies are adopted more widely, eSafety's work will continue to be relevant and a high priority of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this, eSafety faces a funding cliff thanks to the decisions made by those opposite, who left the regulator with a host of non-ongoing or terminating funding measures. After 30 June, eSafety's overall funding would drop by more than half. The question asks about safety. Those opposite liked to announce how important various agencies and programs were, but they left them seriously underfunded. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We discovered this in respect of not only eSafety but also the Viewer Access Satellite Television service and other areas where Australians rely on the government to keep them safe and connected. For example, those opposite announced cell broadcast national messaging to ensure Australians could receive critical emergency warnings, but they actually underfunded it, so it couldn't proceed. Last week, I announced that our upcoming budget ensures this critical project can be delivered, as well as public safety mobile broadband—yet another vital safety project that languished under the previous government. The Albanese government is left once again to clean up the mess left by those opposite, but we're getting on with the job of delivering a better and safer future for all Australians.</span>

                  </a>  The Minister for Communications just outlined the issue with the office of the eSafety Commissioner, the funding for which would end on June 30 under the provisions made by those opposite. But it's not alone. There were child and youth mental health programs—stopped funding. There were family violence prevention legal service providers. There's myGov: My Health Record would not exist were it not funded by us in this budget, because its funding dropped off on 30 June. There are issues such as the National Library of Australia's Trove, which has been so important for researchers—again, no funding. There's the Australian Radioactive Waste Agency funding for nuclear waste management, slated to end in December 2023. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are the examples of unfunded and underinvested programs going forward. There were big announcements from the former Prime Minister about the Brisbane Olympic Games but, unfortunately, not a dollar of funding—not one dollar for the Brisbane Olympic and Paralympic Games. There was nothing for the Commonwealth biosecurity operating costs shortfalls, nothing for Questacon operations to be fixed up, nothing for the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust that was needed. There was underinvestment in Commonwealth national parks like Kakadu. In a building just down the road here, called the National Gallery of Australia, we have, thanks to Gough Whitlam and his vision, one painting that is worth half a billion dollars—one artwork—yet they have buckets there because of water dripping from the leaky roof due to underfunding. Tonight, my government is getting on with putting together a budget that tackles the immediate challenges, better shares opportunities and lays the foundation for a better and more secure future.</span>

We had the fourth housing ministers meeting in Canberra last week where we discussed the broader ambitious housing policy of the federal government. Indeed, we talked about the whole reform agenda. Critical to that agenda, but not the only thing we're doing of course, is the Housing Australia Future Fund Bill—the $10 billion of the Housing Australia Future Fund—</span>

I thank all of the crossbench again for their support. Of course, the Greens party didn't vote at all. When it was considered by the housing ministers last week, every single one of them, including the Liberal minister from Tasmania, signed a letter urging senators to pass this bill.

National Shelter are supporting the bill and want it passed by the parliament. Homelessness Australia supports the bill and wants it passed by the parliament. The Community Housing Industry Association supports the bill and wants it passed by the parliament. Both Master Builders and the Housing Industry Association support the bill and want it passed by the parliament. Industry Super wants the bill to be supported by the parliament. </span>

Tell your senators to support this bill. The time for political grandstanding and further games is over.' There are vulnerable Australians out there today who are relying on this bill to get passed so that we can get more social and affordable homes on the ground for those Australians who need it most. I table the document signed by the housing ministers.</span>

Prime Minister, you promised Australians cheaper mortgages, but after 10 interest rate rises in a row on your watch the average borrower is now paying 62 per cent more in repayments than in 2020 and in almost half of New South Wales postcodes the average repayment is more than 40 per cent of median income. Prime Minister, why do Australians always pay more under Labor?</span>

Another thing that people learn in economics degrees is supply and demand. If you have more houses, you will have an impact on price. That is a product of  supply and demand. There is a bill before the Senate right now that will lead to 30,000 additional social and affordable homes being built for people in need in this country. Those opposite will have no credibility. Whether it's those opposite here, or the Greens political party, they will have no credibility on housing issues while they stand in the way of the Housing Australia Future Fund. I will see if the minister wishes to add the answer. </span>

The Prime Minister is absolutely right. When the housing ministers met in Canberra last week, the Housing Supply and Affordability Council chair addressed the housing ministers, and she said the answer to the questions around housing today is supply, supply and supply. That is what we're trying to do with the Housing Australia Future Fund: add to supply. It is part of our broad spectrum of housing policies that includes, of course, that National Housing Accord and the $575 million that we have already unlocked, which has houses being built on the ground today for Australians. It includes the regional first home buyer guarantee that we brought forward so more regional Australians could—</span>

                  </a>  I say to the member opposite: the issue here in Australia is that we do have a supply issue. We have fewer homes per thousand people in Australia than the OECD average, and that has been going on for a long period of time, which is why we need to build more, which is what the National Housing Accord is about. It's an ambition to build a million homes from 1 July 2024. We have an agreement with the states and the territories, and with the construction sector, to actually get these homes up and running. We have the states that are going to respond to the National Cabinet, and the planning ministers are also going to meet on unlocking supply so that we can put downward pressure on housing prices. That is what we are doing.</span>

Nobody knows the state of Kakadu National Park and Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park better than the member for Lingiari, formerly the Territory MP and now the federal MP for Kakadu. She spent 10 years as the head of the Northern Land Council. She knows it like the back of her hand. She knows that it has been neglected and let down by those opposite for more than a decade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite hid the <span style="font-style:italic;">State </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment</span> report. You know why? Because they left the state of the Australian environment in a bad state and getting worse. In contrast, what are we doing? We are doubling funding for Commonwealth national parks—national parks like Kakadu, like Uluru-Kata Tjuta, like Booderee and like the marine parks—because we know that what has been happening is the slow decline of our national parks. In Kakadu, you've got crocodile signs missing. You've got campgrounds and tracks that are shut to tourists because they are not safe. We want to make sure that these properties are protected for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have invested $45.2 million in the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust, because what we were left by those opposite was these properties in a state of disrepair. I visited with a number of local members to see the cracked seawalls and the convict-built architecture falling into the harbour. We can't afford to let our national estate decline in this way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What you'll see from us tonight in the budget is a doubling of funding for those Commonwealth national parks. You'll see an extra $163 million for the Australian Institute of Marine Science. In Townsville, they had a whole wing of laboratories closed because the machinery is out of date, there's mould in the roof and the offices aren't safe for our scientists to use. So we're doubling funding for the Australian Institute of Marine Science as well, left unfunded by those opposite. This will create 100 extra jobs in Townsville. It will create 110 extra jobs in our national parks. Many of them, of course, will be held by First Nations Australians, and I'm very proud of that. That means a better tourism experience for people visiting our national estate, and, most importantly, it means that the places that are special for Australians and the plants and animals that are at risk will be better protected, for us, for our kids, for our grandkids.</span>

With Australians facing record net overseas migration of 715,000 people over the next two years, why is there no plan to address the further pressure this will put on the cost of living, with increased rents, a worsening housing crisis, longer hospital wait times and increased congestion in capital cities? How much will Australians pay for Labor's big Australia policy?</span>

On that, I make four points: (1) those opposite are opposed to increasing the supply of housing, which is in the Senate at the moment under the Housing Australia Future Fund; (2) migration numbers that they projected before the pandemic would have seen a higher population today than is now present.

In areas such as education, which is a great asset to Australia, a great export that we have, our largest services export, we used to have, say, 100,000 students come in and 100,000 students finish their university degree and then leave. Because of the pandemic, we've had people coming but not going yet. Hence, you have a spike in numbers there.</span>

I commend the shadow minister to have a read of the magnificent speech by the Minister for Home Affairs outlining why Australia's over-reliance on temporary migration by those opposite is not in Australia's national interests, outlining why it is in Australia's national interests to get the right migrants in the right places in order to help our economy. As the minister said, if you look at the plan, it's certainly not about an increase. It's about getting the right mix of migration, as the minister said on page 1 of the paper!</span>

All of those national collecting institutions, whether it be the Portrait Gallery, the National Gallery, the Archives, the National Museum, Bundanon or the Maritime Museum, have the same essential job, which is to tell the story of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of the way they've been mismanaged over the last decade, they also tell a story about economic management. It's not a story you would want to tell. The first concept of economic management with respect to these institutions should be that, if you start with the concept that they hold our most valuable items, you probably want to protect them. You probably don't want, in the National Gallery, our most valuable artworks to be in a building that leaks. If you're talking about the National Library, you think, 'What do you have to do to look after a book?' A starting principle is that you don't put it in the water. But for the National Library, it wasn't just the roof that was leaking; it was the windows that were leaking as well. But, to go one better, at the National Maritime Museum the pontoons were sinking. So it wasn't enough for them to have the water coming down from above; at the National Maritime Museum they were trying to get the museum itself to fall right down to sea level. That's the way they left it. Why was it left this way? Because each of these organisations—already underfunded—was facing a funding cliff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Prime Minister went out to announce the new funding, with the Minister for Finance, out at the National Gallery, the member of staff who took us through the National Gallery was their director of First Nations. You would think this was an essential position at the National Gallery. But, under their funding, that position had to be funded through donations. This was not an add-on position at the National Gallery. This was the director of First Nations. That's what the person was in charge of, and even that position was not funded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As of this year, the funding cliff has gone. These organisations now will be funded, for the workers to now know they still have a job and for the organisations to know that they now can plan for the future for the first time. Finally, these organisations will know that we will no longer have a situation where the items in the museum are in a place with silica dust flying into it—that now our national institutions will be protected as they always should have been.</span>

In April of last year, in PEFO, as a result of the March budget that was in that last week so that a government could cling on for a bit longer—a government that didn't have an agenda—it projected the budget deficit this year, in 2022-23, to be $77.9 billion. That was the prediction. And, of course, we know that the government again—I give credit to the member here and I suggest he dissociate himself from the past because what he mightn't be aware of is that the largest deficit in Australian political history was by the coalition that preceded. The second-largest deficit in Australian was those opposite as well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="L6B" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:52</span>):  Around Australia, this Prime Minister's cost-of-living crisis is affecting millions of Australians. The Prime Minister was pretty clear in the promises he made before the last election. He promised to reduce energy bills by $275 not once, not twice but 97 times. Of course he promised there would be cheaper mortgages, and he promised that Australians would be better off under a Labor government. It was all very clear and very simple. It did not admit of any doubt. So Australians would naturally be very troubled to find that the reality today is extraordinarily different from what this Prime Minister promised. Inflation is at its highest level in over 30 years, core inflation is higher than in the US, Britain, Canada and indeed every G7 nation, and electricity prices have gone up and up and up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is in the experiences of Australian families and households where we see the true toll of this government's escalating cost-of-living crisis. Australian families are experiencing the largest fall in their spending power in this century as more and more families struggle with the crippling effects of inflation. Australian families are even resorting to changing their diets, with one report showing that two-thirds of Australians are finding it less affordable to eat healthily. Banks are reporting more Australian families are falling behind on their repayments, and higher-risk customers can't even get a loan or get refinancing. Business collapses are surging, with warnings of an insolvency Armageddon as Labor's first year in office has seen almost a doubling in the rate at which businesses are becoming insolvent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More Australians with mental health concerns are being forced to cancel appointments with psychologists because they simply can't afford them. Growing numbers of Australians cannot afford to maintain their cars, and they are skipping vital maintenance and repairs. Mortgage risk reports are showing more and more Australian towns and suburbs are entering mortgage shock, with repayments eating up to 60 per cent of household income in some post codes. More than three-quarters of Australians report that they are either extremely or very concerned about the cost of living, with most saying electricity prices are a key concern. The gap between the cost of a typical home and the amount that an average Australian can borrow has more than doubled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More and more Australians are resorting to having meals at home and buying generic brands of food and groceries under this Labor government's cost-of-living crisis. More and more Australians are buying canned food because they cannot afford to buy fresh fruit and vegetables. Australians are turning to charities for support, with Lifeline and other crisis providers reporting huge increases in the number of families requesting their assistance, including, in many cases, families that have never before needed to turn to a crisis provider for help. Families are facing no option but to cut back on non-essential purchases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the national youth mental health survey, the cost of living is the single biggest concern for young Australians. According to analysis by Deloitte Access Economics, at least 300,000 Australian households may be experiencing negative cashflow—more money going out than coming in—following the 10 interest rate rises on this government's watch. The St Vincent de Paul Society in Queensland has reported that more families, particularly young women, are being forced to sleep in their cars due to this government's cost-of-living crisis. The CEO of Foodbank in Queensland recently said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As cost of living continues to rise, families are being forced to choose between keeping a roof over their heads and putting food on the table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very grim picture, and there is very little reason to be confident that this government has a plan to deal with it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is absolutely critical that there be a focus on inflation—getting inflation down, attacking those cost-of-living increases. That will be the test of this budget—whether it puts downward pressure on inflation. When inflation is high it erodes purchasing power, it eats away at savings and it lowers the standard of living. This is the central economic issue facing Australians—the need to get inflation down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fighting inflation with handouts is not the solution to this problem. We need a government which is addressing the problem of inflation at its source, not the symptoms. If Labor were serious about tackling inflation, it would build on the strong economic management that it inherited from the previous coalition government. It would restore the fiscal guardrails to the budget, including the goal of budget balance and including the tax to GDP cap. Is it any surprise that under this Labor government there is now no formal rule as to the maximum percentage of tax it says it will collect as a percentage of GDP?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is seeking to distract from its spending plans by dropping to the media that the budget will be in surplus for 2022-23, but the real story is what happens in 2023-24, the actual year the Treasurer is preparing a budget for, and in the out years beyond that. A short-term surplus thanks to a one-off jump in commodity export prices and strong employment numbers inherited from the Morrison government is one thing, but a structural deficit over the next few years as Labor fails to get spending under control is very bad news for the Australians who are concerned that inflation will become entrenched and that their cost of living will go up and up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The simple fact is: if this government does not get spending under control, this budget will drive more inflation. Unless this government limits spending, it will be adding to the cost of your mortgage, your rent, your groceries and just about everything else Australians need to spend their hard-earned money on. We need to see from this government and this budget a long-term approach to controlling spending. It is critical that the economy is growing faster than spending. That's how the coalition operated between 2013 and 2019, prior to a once-in-a-century pandemic, and it was that budget rule, that fiscal discipline, which produced the outcome of a steadily reducing budget deficit until we achieved budget balance. But that is very different to the psychology and the instinctive nature of Labor governments. There is nothing a Labor government likes to do more than spend and tax. We've seen the pattern with every previous Labor government, and already we are seeing the same pattern materialise when it comes to the Albanese Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the October budget, we saw the Albanese Labor government add $115 billion of spending over the four years of the forward estimates compared to the budget brought down by the Morrison government in March 2022. There's another $45 billion of spending that we have opposed because that is not what our budget needs. It's not what our fiscal policy needs. It's not what we need as a nation if we are going to attack the core problem which is challenging the lives and lifestyles of every Australian—that is, the problem of inflation and ever-rising cost of living. As this government adds more spending, it also adds additional interest costs over many years into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw a very traditional Labor approach in its first budget in October last year. We saw Labor increase spending, making the structural deficit worse, and we saw Labor abandon any formal goal of achieving budget balance. That's not a responsible approach. It's not good budget management, and we see now that, around Australia, Australian households and Australian families are paying a price for this government's poor management of the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other very important reason to keep spending under control is: if you're controlling spending, you don't need to go around raising taxes. Higher taxes are a huge problem. They kill aspiration. They hurt families. They delay the investment that provides jobs and helps small businesses to grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian families, every day, every week, are making very tough decisions about their household budgets. It is imperative that we have, as a nation, a budget that also involves decisions that address the fundamental problem of cost of living and inflation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="LTU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEARNEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  I am really beginning to worry about those on the opposite side of the House. Maybe they're deaf, maybe they're a bit dim—I don't know! They seem to be throwing this question at us time after time, and we tell them time after time that we understand that the cost of living is hitting a lot of Australians hard. We understand that inflation is the defining economic challenge of 2023. It was in 2022—and, as the Prime Minister mentioned today, those opposite, when they were in government, had an inflation measure the highest this century has seen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians understand that we did not create these challenges, but they elected us to take responsibility for addressing them—and we are. The Albanese Labor government is delivering the positive change that Australians voted for—and, can I remind them, that is including the good people of Aston. They recently voted for a Labor government, overwhelmingly—we had a wonderful Labor candidate in Mary Doyle—but they turned their back on the opposition. I am beginning to wonder if those opposite are not reading the tea leaves. Yes, we know there is a lot of work to do, but we are staying focused on easing the pressure on families and helping Australians manage their budgets. That is why the centrepiece of tonight's budget will be a $14.6 billion cost-of-living relief package.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first phase of this, for example, is our cheaper medicines policy. That came into effect on 1 January this year. The cheaper medicines policy is an incredibly important policy for so many Australians who are having to choose between taking their medicines or paying the rent or putting food on the table. As a former health professional, I have had, from time to time, people telling me that they just take medicines every other day because they think that is cheaper. We know that it is important they take them every single day. Or they might miss a month or a week. Now, they no longer have to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight's budget will go further, delivering cheaper medicines for over six million Australians. We will halve unnecessary visits to the GP and the pharmacist just to fill a repeat script. This will save Australians up to $180 a year for every eligible medicine they buy. Thanks to my wonderful colleague here the Minister for Aged Care, Ms Wells, we are delivering a massive increase for our aged-care workers by giving them a wage rise, an $11.3 billion investment. That's a wage rise to some of the lowest-paid but most-valued workers in our economy, a wage rise which will actually help with the cost of living. Self-funded retirees will access a seniors card under this government, which will give them access to the concession rate of PBS medicines and bulk-billed GP visits. That is a massive saving for many, many retirees. These are just some of the measures that have been announced in my own portfolio of health and aged care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Outside health and aged care, we have already announced electricity bill relief, which those opposite voted against. We have increased support for single parents. The Treasurer will have much more to say about that tonight, but we know that this single measure alone will have a massive impact on single parents struggling to meet the rising cost of living. We have successfully argued for a Fair Work Commission wage rise in line with inflation. We have introduced legislation that will drive investment in cleaner and cheaper energy, putting downward pressure on power prices. We are delivering cheaper child care, with one of the biggest investments in history in the cost of child care, which means that women can go back to work if they want to and will pay less for their child care. That, of course, will ease the cost-of-living pressures. We are delivering fee-free TAFE. You can't cut a cost of living measure any more than by making it free. This means that more people will get the skills they need to get good jobs—well paid jobs in our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are expanding paid parental leave. When I had my babies, there was no paid parental leave—none at all—and we had to struggle along on one income. It was a great innovation by the Gillard government to introduce paid parental leave, and now we will be expanding that even more. This will, of course, ease the cost of living for parents. We are building more affordable homes, including through the new National Housing Accord. If those opposite could just see their way through to supporting the National Housing Future Fund, we would be able to build a lot more. We know that increasing supply will bring the cost of housing down, which will, of course, help people with the cost of living. Pensions, allowances and rent assistance have all increased in line with inflation. We are going to improve the bargaining system, which will make it easier for workers to get wage rises and create gender equality in the workplace, making sure that women get equal and better pay. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go back over some of these things I have said. What is it that those opposite don't get? We are easing pressure on families. We are introducing a relief package. There will be cheaper medicines and cheaper visits to the GP. We will have wage rises for aged-care workers and other low-paid workers. There will be downward pressure on power prices, cheaper child care, fee-free TAFE, expanded paid parental leave, more affordable homes and increased cost-of-living measures that will give more money to pensioners and people who need rent assistance. We will improve the wages of every worker in this country. They are all things that will actually help with the cost of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at the Liberal legacy. They suppressed wage growth—suppressed wage growth—as a deliberate design feature of their government's economic policy. The now Leader of the Opposition, the then health minister, ripped out, or tried to rip out, $50 billion from hospitals; he tried to increase the cost of scripts by $5 and charge every Australian a tax on their visits to their GP. When Labor was able to block this attack on our health system and Australians' right to access it, he hit them with a Medicare rebate freeze. He was voted, by Australian doctors, the worst health minister in living memory, and we know that wasn't for nothing. So what a legacy! Compare what I said before with its opposite—with what the opposition did when they were in government. The opposition charged a bigger tax; they raised the price of scripts; they froze the Medicare rebate. Such a stellar record from the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite when it comes to cost-of-living relief! I can't help but sit here and think, when I listen to them go on and on and on about caring about people struggling with the cost of living, that they're pouring crocodile tears all the way down their face. They deliberately designed a decade of wage stagnation, froze the Medicare rebate and oversaw a decade of shameful neglect of our aged-care system; they refused to vote for energy bill relief; they said no to every single proposal that we have put forward to help Australian households. And yet they stand there and ask the same question over and over.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only Labor's government will do absolutely everything in its power to support Australians and Australian workers. We have given pay rises. We have given true cost-of-living relief. And this budget tonight will go even further than I have been able to outline tonight. It will be a sensible budget. It will give cost-of-living relief. It will manage inflation. It will repair the budget. It will clean up the mess that that government left from nine years of absolute neglect of this economy, of workers, of everyday Australians, because only Labor governments deliver real, tangible relief to Australian households. Australians know this. Australians voted for this. And only very recently did we see they voted for this in Aston.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When will they listen? When will they get this through their heads?</span>

When you are heading a union body, wages are important, but so are real wages, and, when those opposite come in here and talk about wage increases, what they should be referring to is real wages, because real wages are going down. They are. Real wages—the take-home pay, the disposable income, of those hardworking Australians—are actually being reduced.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sitting next to her was the Minister for Aged Care, and I acknowledge the work that she is doing in that portfolio. I acknowledge the work that she's doing in the ministry of sport. But when you go and you talk to people in aged-care centres, to those running those country aged-care centres—and I appreciate they're saying that there's going to be a wage jump for those workers tonight, and that's good—some of those workers won't have an aged-care centre to go to, because of the 24/7 nursing edict that has been placed on them by those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You get a good aged-care centre, such as the one I visited recently at Junee, and they are desperately worried that they won't be able to provide for their residents with 24/7 nursing. They can't find cleaners. They can't find cooks. They can't find people to change the beds, let alone 24/7 nursing. What are those aged-care centres supposed to do? And that is the case right over regional and, particularly, remote Australia, where aged-care centres are desperately worried.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the price of groceries is going up. We know that Scott's Refrigerated Transport is going backwards; they've been placed in liquidation. I heard the member for Cooper, the assistant minister, talking about building more houses. Jolly good! But who are they going to get to build those houses—let alone the materials to build those houses? That industry is absolutely going backwards, unfortunately. It was going alright under the home ownership schemes that we put in place. But that industry, the building industry, is doing it tough at the moment, and not helped by those opposite. I listened to the Minister for Housing going on not that long ago about a million houses. Good luck building them! Good luck finding the people to actually be able to build those houses!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then we come to students. You would think that those opposite would have placed students at the top of their expectations—at the top of their aspirations and the top of the care that they supposedly give. And yet the HECS debt is going to reach a 32-year high under those opposite. How do struggling students, such as those like Wagga Wagga's Maddison Dickinson—who still has, she says, about $6,000 to pay off on a HECS debt for partially completing a Bachelor of Paramedicine and a Bachelor of Arts—a 24-year-old, pay off her HECS debt when it's at a 32-year high? I don't know. Maybe those opposite could answer that question. Students are going to be hit with a seven-per-cent indexation rate at the beginning of June. Students are doing it tough, and all those opposite can do is to come in and say, 'Oh, well, we're bringing the budget back into surplus.' They haven't produced a surplus since 1989; Senator Claire Chandler wasn't even born the last time that Labor produced a surplus!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the fact remains that they demonise the coal industry, they demonise the gas industry and they demonise the resources sector, which is providing the iron ore, the resources and the export cheques. Then they gloat about producing a budget surplus on the back of that resources sector—which kept us going during COVID!—and on the back of the agriculture sector, which kept us going during COVID. And they're hitting the pharmacists hard—I'll get onto that in the next speech I make in this place. But the pharmacists are doing it tough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the assistant minister for regional health, a former pharmacist, belonging to a government which should know better. In some places, particularly in remote country Australia, the pharmacist is the only health professional in town. Why would you hit them so hard, to the point of closure? Why would you do that? It's all about the cost of living and they don't care! <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  Member for Riverina, you asked about those nursing homes in your electorate who are concerned about 24/7 nurses being put on and whether they can do it. You asked the parliament, 'What are they supposed to do?' How about they speak to the excellent Minister for Aged Care, who is sitting right there, about the supports and exemptions that are in place? If you are not referring them to do that, then you're not doing your job! You're not doing your job, because she has said so many times that she is there to help any facility that has trouble meeting the 24/7 nurse legislation. There are exemptions and there are supports. So instead of coming in here and having a crack at the minister, do your job and speak to your nursing facilities that have concerns. Tell them to get in contact with the minister, her office and her department, and they will help them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's because we are a government which brings in policies that make life better for people, and we do everything we can to implement them. That's as opposed to the last government, which did wonderful announcements and pretty good press releases, at times, but didn't implement anything. They didn't implement anything. I tell you what, if you want to find a minister who cares more about people than about herself and who works her fingers to the bone, then it's the Minister for Aged Care. Anyone who says differently—whose name might have an extra S in it—might look in the mirror and wonder what jealousy looks like, because then she will see it. The Albanese Labor government are doing what we can to address the cost-of-living issues that we inherited from nine years of wasted time, wasted spending and a lack of action. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, my community saved $259,743.57 on PBS medicines in January and February of this year alone. That's $260,000 saved in my electorate, where there are pockets of some of the most disadvantaged people in Victoria, where chronic health problems are way above the state average and where we know how important it is to be able to access medicines. Since the Albanese government reduced the co-payment on 1 January of this year, more than 22,800 scripts in Dunkley have been cheaper. This makes medicines more affordable and accessible, it takes the sting out of the rising cost of living and it delivers better outcomes for people who are often in the most vulnerable position of their lives. </span>

I can't tell you the number of times I might have not been able to take my medicine for a day or two because I forgot to fill my script. I know the difference 60-day dispensing is going to make to vulnerable people who have chronic health conditions—not to mention the vulnerable people with chronic health conditions who are also struggling because they don't earn much money or they're on a pension. It is going to make the world of difference to those people. Those on the other side can come here with their rhetoric and their ranting and their made-up situations, but we on this side know that the measures we're putting in place are making life better for Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="282981" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  Tonight, the Treasurer will stand at the dispatch box and deliver what he claims is a cost-of-living budget—a budget that he says will deliver cost-of-living relief for Australians who need it most. The thing is we've heard that before from this government. We heard it when they promised a $275 reduction to your power bill, when they promised cheaper mortgages and when they promised no changes to super, lower inflation, no higher taxes, no changes to franking credits—the list goes on and on. Every single one of those promises has been broken, and it hasn't even been 12 months. And the cost of living for Australian families continues to rise. Groceries and petrol prices are soaring. Fruits and vegetables have increased in cost by 4.9 per cent and dairy products by a whopping 14.9 per cent. Families simply can't afford it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not the only thing that has gone up under this government. The last time Labor was in government, early childhood education fees skyrocketed by 53 per cent in just six years. In the last six months, already, out-of-pocket costs have gone up by 6.5 per cent. In only six months, they've gone up 6.5 per cent, and let's watch them go up further. Centres are struggling to cover the increasing costs of rent, of food and of wages, which means providers will continue to put their fees up. This leads to higher out-of-pocket costs, leaving families with less money to put food on their tables and to pay those bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And yet this government continues to promise families they will be better off after 1 July. It's just another broken promise waiting to happen. This government likes to bang on about how they know how hard it is to struggle, that Labor cares about you and that the Prime Minister cares about you. Families are resorting to buying canned food, eating out less, falling behind in their repayments, skipping vital car repairs and even mental health appointments to make ends meet. It's not good enough for Australian families. Charities are inundated with requests for support and assistance, and they simply can't keep up. Families are literally choosing between keeping a roof over their heads and putting food on the table. And while you've been trying to figure out how you're going to pay your bills, the Prime Minister has the gall to say, 'It's been a good 10 months.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, maybe it has been a good 10 months for him. He has been gallivanting around the world, taking helicopters to barbecues and partying at lavish weddings, while you are suffering and can't pay your bills. When it comes to the Prime Minister, it doesn't matter what he says; it's about what he does, and his actions show time and again that he doesn't care about you or your family. Almost every day of the election campaign, the Prime Minister promised that he would show up and that he would take responsibility. Well, it's about time he did that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately for many Australian families, this cost-of-living crisis will continue to get worse under Labor. Australian families are making tough decisions about their own budgets. Inflation is eating into Australians' pay packets and real wages are going backwards, causing the price of essential household goods and services to skyrocket. This government must show that they are prepared to do the same: to drive down the rate of inflation through budget measures, not a one-off sugar hit. Inflation comes from Canberra; it's not coming from Vladimir Putin and it's not coming from the war in Ukraine. I know that those opposite like to pretend it comes from somewhere else, but it comes directly from them and their decisions. Unless the government limits spending, Labor will continue to add to the cost of your mortgage, your rent, your groceries and just about everything else Australians are spending their hard-earned money on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not holding my breath tonight about the budget for Australians and the cost-of-living crisis. The last time this lot were in government they spent billions on programs like school halls and the pink batts disaster, and cut essential funding for mental health and the PBS. They stopped listing medicines because they ran out of money. It sounds like they're reading more from their playbook; they have already cut mental health funding at the first opportunity. It's clear: you can't trust Labor to keep their promises. You can't trust Labor to run the economy, and Australians always pay more under Labor.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SITOU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:28</span>):  Two things magically happened on 21 May last year: the Albanese Labor government was elected—very exciting!—and the coalition suddenly realised there was an issue with the cost of living. It was a sudden realisation, because they didn't act on it during the nine years they were in government. Let's examine why their sudden interest in helping with the cost of living is such a charade now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Act No. 1: under the coalition, the cost of child care went up by 41 per cent. Seventy-three thousand families were locked out of child care because they couldn't afford it. What did that mean? It meant kids couldn't get the early education we know is so critical and it meant there were fewer parents heading back into the workforce and contributing to our economy. And, critically, when it comes to the cost of living, it was a hit to household budgets. What is the Albanese Labor government doing to address this? We have reduced the cost of child care for 96 per cent of families across Australia. Approximately 7,800 families in my electorate are going to benefit from this. Over nine years, those opposite allowed the cost of child care to rise and rise. Under the Albanese Labor government, from 1 July we are making child care more affordable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Act No. 2: power prices. This is probably where those opposite really excelled at acting. They acted like they were a government trying to come up with an energy policy. There were 22 attempts, but they couldn't deliver a single one, and, even when they had the chance to provide households with energy relief, they voted against it. Instead of siding with the Australian people, they sided with gas companies. They act like they care about reducing energy prices, but they voted for higher power prices. Contrast that with the Albanese Labor government. We have an energy policy that, first of all, isn't here after 22 attempts, and we are working our way through implementing it. We are upgrading our energy grid to enable more renewable energy to come online. Last year we capped gas and coal prices to shield Australians from the unprecedented international pressures on energy markets. We are acting on climate change and providing households with energy price relief. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In tonight's budget we are helping five million households and one million businesses with a reduction in energy bills. Those opposite couldn't deliver an energy policy, couldn't give energy certainty and couldn't help with power bills for households. What could they do? And here we come to the final act. Here's one of the few policies they had when they were in government—nine long years, and they had one policy: robodebt. It is extraordinary that those opposite can come into this place and pretend to care about the cost of living when they were the architects of robodebt. It was an illegal and immoral policy that had devastating consequences for the most financially vulnerable in our community—and they knew it. It was those opposite who hounded the most vulnerable with unlawful debt notices, chasing them for debts they did not owe. It was those opposite who decided to play the role of debt collector, scaring Australians who were already right on the edge. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrast that with the Labor government. In tonight's budget we are making it easier for those receiving the single parenting payment and JobSeeker. While those opposite put on the performance of a lifetime and pretend to care about the cost of living, we are actually taking action. For nine years under those opposite the cost of child care skyrocketed. They failed to deliver an energy plan and voted against providing energy price relief, and one of the few policies they had was robodebt. Today is performative. For nine years they did nothing on the cost of living. They may deserve a Gold Logie for their acting job today, but they don't deserve to be in government. That is why they were voted out on 21 May, and that's why they lost the seat of Aston, which is why we have the wonderful new member for Aston, Mary Doyle, amongst our ranks. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  I thank the member for Reid for many of her remarks. I note that she has spoken about acting and Logie awards. I would just draw the House's attention and the member for Reid's attention to the Prime Minister's pledges that were made: household and business energy bills will be cut by $275—that's act 1; a real lasting plan for cheaper electricity and cheaper mortgages—that's act 2; Australians will be better off under a Labor government—that's act 3. When the current Prime Minister was opposition leader, he personally promised $275 power bill cuts no fewer than 97 times during the election campaign. Not only has the Prime Minister broken that promise; he refuses in question time to even answer any questions about power bills, and we saw that again today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The energy crisis affects Australians. It affects Australian families. It affects Australian businesses. Under the Albanese Labor government life has become progressively harder for many Australians.This is despite the Prime Minister's claim only a few months ago that it's 'been a pretty good 10 months for most Australians'. Pretty good? Rather than Australians being better off, Australians are paying more in the economy that exists under this Albanese Labor government. Australian families are experiencing the largest fall in their spending power this century, as more and more families struggle with the crippling effects of inflation. Families are even resorting to changing their diets, with one recent report showing two-thirds of people have found it less affordable to eat healthily. This includes Australians buying canned food because they can't afford fresh fruit and vegetables. This is a great shame. More and more Australians are resorting to having meals at home and buying generic brands of food and groceries. Our banks are reporting more Australian families are falling behind on their repayments, and higher-risk customers can't get loans or refinance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I spoke in this place about Caruso's Italian Restaurant, in the Sutherland shire. It was forced to close its doors permanently. They had been in the Sutherland shire for 17 years.  Owners Rocky and Kerrin Pitarelli cited rising electricity costs, labour costs and staff shortages as reasons for their closure. More recently, in my electorate, Howling Forest cafes at Kirrawee and Kareela have closed, with proprietors Ange and Chad citing the current economic climate as the reason behind the closure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I visited local businesses in the suburb of Sutherland with the shadow Treasurer. Cafe 2232 owner George explained they've had to increase their prices by 30 per cent over the past six to eight months. Scott's Florist owner Trudy reported a doubling and tripling of the price of fresh flowers. At Left Bower Cafe, Luke cited rising energy costs and the cost of dairy as issues facing their trade. Mandy from The Beauty Loft stated she had suffered $1,000 in cancellations the last time an interest rate rise was reported. We are seeing more Australians with mental health concerns being forced to cancel appointments with psychologists because they simply can't afford them. Mortgage risk reports are showing more and more Australian towns and suburbs are entering mortgage shock. In my electorate of Hughes, over 22,000 households are mortgage holders. With an average increase of more than $1,400 per month, this is impacting Australian families directly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The key test for tonight's budget is whether it will put downward pressure on inflation. The Albanese Labor government should deliver a budget with less spending to tackle its inflation crisis. Inflation comes from Canberra. After almost a year of inaction, Labor's budget must make bringing down inflation its No. 1 priority.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  I'll start by saying that I know that families and households are doing it really tough at the moment, and it's a really challenging time. All households recognise that the cost of living has gone up, and it is an issue that my electorate talks to me about when I go doorknocking. However, I will remind the member for Hughes that, unfortunately, we've wasted a decade, with the coalition asleep at the wheel. A government needs to not only deal with the issues of the day but also plan for the future, and frankly, the coalition government had no plan for the future. The Albanese Labor government is cleaning up this mess.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the member for Hughes's political theatre metaphor, let's reflect on that: act 1, failure of the coalition to balance the budget; act 2, failure to create a single energy policy despite there being over 30 attempts to create a plan and not one effective policy to show for it. Act three: a failure to get wages moving again, and, instead, suggesting that low wage growth is a deliberate design feature of our economic architecture. You'd think the acts would end at the election of the Albanese Labor government, but there's an act four: the failure of the coalition opposition to even hold the seat of Aston. You have to credit their optimism, though. Before racking up $894 billion of debt, they bought themselves these mugs saying, 'back in black'. They're the masters of theatrics but not of substance—as Paul Keating would say, 'All tip, no iceberg,' or as Kathleen Studdert from Professionals Australia said, 'All mug and no coffee.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no surprise that when we look around the mainland of this country that it's wall-to-wall Labor governments, because when it comes to action on the cost of living, Australians cannot trust Liberals. Debt and financial mismanagement is part of the Liberals' DNA. In WA, the powerhouse of our economy, we saw a boom squandered and our AAA credit rating lost by the Barnett Liberal government. But, of course, we've seen these characteristics in the previous coalition government. We saw not one or two billion but $13 billion worth of JobKeeper payments go to companies that increased their sales between April and September 2021. This happened without a single thought on whether they should pay this back, and, meanwhile, instead, we had debt collectors relentlessly pursuing individuals for $32 million in JobKeeper for overpayments.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, Labor is wanting to have targeted cost-of-living relief, and we're being careful to make sure that we don't feed the inflation dragon. I'll talk to what the Albanese Labor government is doing to help the people of Australia. In my electorate of Swan, we saw $442,439 put back into the pocket of those with prescriptions, thanks to our cheaper medicine policy. Tonight in the budget we will deliver further savings to households when it comes to hundreds of medicines. The Albanese Labor Government is easing the cost-of-living pressures for millions of Australians by allowing them to buy two months of eligible medicines for the price of a single prescription. Concession cardholders could save up to $43.80 a year per medicine, while others could save up to $180.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our cheaper child care will benefit 1.2 million families from 1 July. We know that this will help ease the financial stress for families across the country, and 96 per cent of families will be better off financially through our increases to the childcare rebate. We're getting wages moving again. Australians on minimum wage received a 5.1 per cent pay rise at the outset of the Albanese Labor government. I know that some weren't prepared to support our lowest paid workers' pay increase of $1 an hour. Those on minimum wage have played important roles during the pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government supports aged-care workers. Last week the Minister for Aged Care announced an $11.3 billion package to deliver a 15 per cent pay increase to the award wage for aged-care workers. We're doing this because our aged-care workers deserved reward and recognition, for the important, invaluable role that they play in our community. We're working on the job of helping Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  Before I begin, can I congratulate those opposite, and the new member for Aston, Mary Doyle, on getting elected. That is a significant achievement for her, her campaign team and the Labor Party. But, all of that said, I have been in this parliament for not even a year, but I have been an observer of politics long enough to remember when commentators were talking about wall-to-wall Liberal governments and what that meant. I remember how fleeting that can be, because to be in power, at a state or a federal level, is the gift of the Australian people, and you have to earn that, not only on the day of the election but also on every day after. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt, for those who will compare notes on the Aston by-election, cost of living was one of top issues. There will be an analysis of what happened—my party will do one and your party will do one, I'm sure—but it's clear that the people of Melbourne and, probably, the people of Australia, are giving you a chance. They're giving you a chance to solve their problems. When they give you a chance, for them, it's really giving you a second chance, because when you look at the promises that were made before the last election, those promises have been broken. You've heard those promises many times over: the several references to $275; the claims of real, lasting plans for cheaper electricity and cheaper mortgages and that Australia would be better off under a Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So you're being given a second chance, and, when you're given a second chance, I say, 'Don't waste it,' because I don't think Australians will give you a third chance. This is it—this is your second chance.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight the Treasurer has one job and it's to reduce inflation. The reason that that's his most important job is that, at the moment, all that work is being done by the Reserve Bank of Australia—all of it. We can have a tit-for-tat about who is to blame: the previous government, or the last 12 months? And the truth is: it's a bit of both. It has to be a bit of both—it would be unreasonable to say otherwise. But what you do is on you, and what you do can't be to leave it all to the Reserve Bank.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has to be a role for fiscal policy, because, when we think back to the latest, or the last, increase by the RBA, that was devastating for Australian families because it caught them off guard. They weren't expecting it. The professionals weren't expecting it. We saw it in how the market reacted. We saw it in how all of the commentators and all of the media, who are professionals at this, didn't expect it. One of the reasons it happened was that the RBA was addressing something that the government should have been assisting with, and that is core inflation. You can brag about where Australia ranks in inflation around the world, but core inflation—which excludes some of the variable items, of food and resources, which go up and down on a more variable rate—is the inflation that is 'sticky', that lasts longer and that affects people more. When the RBA saw core inflation being higher here than in any G7 country, then what you were doing, as to fiscal policy, wasn't working, and the RBA had to do it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You may call it a cliche to say it's having one foot on the accelerator and one foot on the brake, but it is the most simple metaphor for what's happening. We need fiscal policy. We need the government to be working in tandem with our monetary policy, not counter to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today in question time we saw a lot of hubris. We saw a lot of chanting. The responses of 'Why?' were repeated with great enthusiasm today. And we heard the same cliches again, of having inherited a trillion dollars of debt—said to be 'Liberal debt', even though half of that was inherited from the previous Labor government. And let's just forget that we had a pandemic! Let's forget about that, and let's forget that there were actual responses to that, which included your support of the pandemic debt. That's just conveniently forgotten. So, yes, debt is a massive problem. And guess what? There is a bipartisan element to that debt. But it is dishonest to ignore the pandemic and the important decisions that were made by the previous government and your support of those. In fact, you didn't just support them; you asked for them to be extended. Debt would be even higher if you actually had been sitting over there during the pandemic.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="101351" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  Tonight, the Albanese Labor government is going to deliver the first budget surplus of an Australian government in 15 years. I hope I haven't given anything away, but I think everyone knows! That is remarkable. This is the first surplus since the global financial crisis. It is such an achievement—a significant achievement for the Albanese government in its first year. But, more than that, we are doing this while still delivering targeted relief to assist Australians with the pressures of the cost of living, because we know that the cost of living is front of mind for so many Australians right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike that mob over there, we are focused on relieving the pressure on Australians doing it tough, because responsible economic management is about investing in our economy and our people. It's about providing sensible, targeted relief whilst making investments that set Australia up for the future. So that's a bit of a contrast to those on the opposition benches. I've seen the shadow Treasurer, Angus Taylor, doing the rounds this morning with a number of pithy, albeit pathetic, one-liners. He said, 'A drover's dog could deliver a surplus.' That was his line! Well, what does that say for the opposition? Nine years of the previous Liberal government and they were unable to deliver a single one, but he says a drover's dog could deliver it. The poor drover's dog. He gives it a bad name. We should probably replace the Dog on the Tuckerbox on the road to Gundagai with a statue of Angus Taylor. In all his regal, imperious attire, he could be up there on the tuckerbox. It is remarkable that they are making that argument. It's a pathetic argument. In nine years they couldn't deliver one surplus, and we've done it in the first year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are led now by a leader of the opposition who, as health minister—let's not forget—tried to tax Australians $7 every time they visited a GP, tried to raise the price of every script by $5 and froze the Medicare rebate. That's the reverse of relief on the cost of living; it's the exact reverse of what you should be doing. Is it any surprise he was voted the worst health minister in living memory by Australian doctors?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not just criticise. The government is helping so many Australians doing it tough. It's doing a lot, so let's talk about the positives. We've already delivered cheaper medicines, cutting the maximum co-payment for general patients from $42.50 to $30. This is going to save someone taking a single medicine up to $150 a year. We've reduced the cost for pensioners and concession cardholders so they will pay no more than $5 a week for all their medicine needs, no matter how many medicines they take. In September we cut the price of more than 2,000 brands of medicine, delivering $130 million back into the pockets of hardworking Australians. And tonight in the budget we will deliver—and you'll hear all about it—further savings to households when it comes to hundreds of medicines. For six million Australians we'll halve their medicine costs, reducing their need to visit the GP and the pharmacist, with $1.6 billion going back into their pockets over the next four years. These are sensible, targeted, measured relief measures that will make a real difference to Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, when it comes to wages, the government is supporting wage rises for underpaid Australians. We know the best support for Australians struggling with the cost of living is a wage increase. These are wage increases they certainly missed out on under the previous government, who said, in their own words, that wage suppression was a deliberate feature of their economic policy. The Albanese government and the budget will deliver a 15 per cent increase in the minimum wage for many aged-care workers across Australia. The Minister for Aged Care is here, and I note all the work she has done on behalf of the government to make this happen. This is the biggest pay rise for the sector ever. It's never been this big. That is so significant for so many people. A registered nurse could earn up to $196 a week extra or up to $10,000 a year more. It will help address the injustice of underpayment for our nurses and for our aged-care workers, and it will help them with the cost of living. It's practical and it's real.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also addressed housing. Unfortunately, those on the opposite side and some on the crossbenches are opposing the Housing Australia Future Fund. It is crazy that they are doing that. This is about providing what is most important to Australians: a roof over their heads. And we'll hear about support for rental housing in the budget tonight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I've just got to say we are committed to delivering real relief which will ease the cost of living for so many Australians—millions around this country.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BURNS:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—I'm pleased to present the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights fifth scrutiny report of 2023. In this report, the committee has considered 29 new bills and 172 new legislative instruments and has commented on six of these bills and one legislative instrument.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two of the bills the committee has commented on do not raise human rights concerns. Rather, the committee has chosen to comment on these bills to explain why they appear to be compatible with human rights. This is important, especially on the first bill that I am going to talk about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the Voice debate, there have been a lot of reasons and debating points put forward as to why the 'no' campaign should prevail, and one of those false points has been around the rights of those being activated by an institution such as the Voice. The committee has inquired, and, as per the excellent advice that we have received from human rights experts and lawyers, any claim that one group would be disadvantaged or discriminated against by the Voice is unfounded; it has no substance, and I'm going to talk about that right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has commented on the Constitution Alteration (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice) Bill 2023. The committee considers this bill promotes the right to take part in public affairs by facilitating the holding of a referendum. The committee also considers that if a voice to parliament were established, this would promote the right of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to participate in public affairs, the right to self-determination and the right to equality and nondiscrimination and is therefore compatible with human rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the right to equality and nondiscrimination of non-Indigenous Australians, the committee notes that the bill is aimed at achieving the legitimate objective of realising the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and would not negatively affect the ability of other people to enjoy or exercise their rights and freedoms. Let me say that again: the bill is aimed at achieving the legitimate objective of realising the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and would not negatively affect the ability of other people to enjoy or exercise their rights and freedoms. The committee therefore considers the bill to be compatible with the right to equality and nondiscrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has also commented on the Family Law Amendment Bill, which seeks to make numerous amendments to the family law system. The committee notes that several measures contained in the bill would promote human rights, particularly the rights of the child, culture, and equality and nondiscrimination. There are, however, also some measures that would limit certain rights. The committee considers these limitations would be permissible as a matter of international human rights law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this report, the committee has also conducted its consideration of three matters raised previously. In particular, the committee has considered the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Income Management Reform) Bill 2023 and two related legislative instruments, which seek to extend all measures relating to income management and to the enhanced income management regime. The committee considers that providing participants with access to a bank account and associated debit card that offers superior technology and improved banking functions would be a positive measure. However, for many years the committee has raised human rights concerns regarding mandatory income management. Noting the inadequate safeguards and insufficient flexibility to consider individual circumstances, the committee considers this legislation does risk limiting the rights to social security, privacy, equality and nondiscrimination, and the rights of the child. The committee also thanks the minister for her engagement with the committee on this matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the committee has concluded its consideration of the Social Security (Tables for the Assessment of Work-related Impairment for Disability Support Pension) Determination 2023. This instrument sets out the rules for assessing whether a person meets work-related impairment levels for assessing eligibility for the disability support pension. The committee has raised concerns about the compatibility of this tool with the rights to equality and nondiscrimination, social security and adequate standard of living for those who are not eligible for the DSP and draws these concerns to the attention of the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With these comments, I once again, on behalf of the committee members, thank the hardworking staff of our committee; they are first-class public servants. I commend the committee's human rights scrutiny report 5 of 2023 to the House.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The unjustified persecution of Brumbies lent institutionalized endorsement from sections of government bureaucracies, has become an historical institutionalised prejudice, fuelled by rhetoric, inconclusive research produced by unelected ideological environmental minorities. Brumbies are recognised internationally as an Australian icon, Brumbies have lived symbiotically with native wildlife for over two hundred years. Brumbies contribute to biodiversity, reducing fuel for wildfires, hold a place in Australian cultural history, and tourism. Coins minted, stamps created in their honour. Barbaric unjustified cruelty toward Brumbies that does not conform with national standard operating procedures or community values has been routinely well documented, cruelty non-conforming with national standard operating procedures and best practice. There are now cultural and institutional barriers blocking policy reform on Brumby protection which has become extreme leading to community volatility. Brumbies supported Australian soldiers, Australia's Light Horsemen became legendary, 'Bill the Bastard' one of their bravest steeds. Banjo Patterson wrote The Man From Snowy River acknowledging the bond with Australian Brumbies, Elynne Mitchell recognised the connection in her books, and artists and film makers immortalised Australian Brumbies in film and song. Brumbies are gentle sentient beings, forming strong family bonds, and recognised as descendants of horses contributing to the establishment, protection of this nation.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Employees who are made redundant between the period of November 1st to December 31st face significant challenges. Many companies do not hire so late in the year and defer any recruitment to the next year, making securing new employment difficult leaving many jobless and without income for almost 3 months and leaving them in financial difficulties. In addition, this period of year is often costly, with pre-booked holidays or family gatherings that require significant costs which can lead to increased financial strains. With the downturn of the economy and the increase in no-fault termination of employment, many employees are paying for the financial consequences of irresponsible operations management and planning of many organisations. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to provide better worker protections for employees made redundant at no fault of their own from November 1st to December 31st. Better rights can include expanding compensation rights to those who have been with a company for less than 6 months to include 4-6 weeks of pay in lieu. In addition, those who have been with the organisation for more than 6 months are entitled to 2 months of pay in lieu. Those who have been with the organisation for more than 1 year should be entitled to 3 months of pay in lieu. These requests are designed to assist employees in finding financial stability until the recruitment market picks up in January and to ensure organisations are the ones financially responsible for their layoffs. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">As stated by NTEU, international student workers are susceptible to exploitation by employers, with underpayment, wage theft, bullying, harassment, and labour trafficking all potential risks. These risks increase when work hours for students are restricted. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">When a student arrives in Australia the market situation, inflation, accommodation challenges are at a different level than an year later. Students often find it hard to manage their living costs which does increase by many folds in most cases as the time passes by and then restrictions on work hours make it worse for them to be able to survive and makes it really hard to focus on studies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Even UNSW, Uni of Adelaide and many other institutes/organizations have recognised that unrestricted work tights have helped both, international students as well as businesses and hence Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Besides all these reasons, in spite of paying three or four fold more tuition fee than domestic students, international students don't have the same work rights as domestic students which is unfair. Due to work hours restrictions students are not employed by most employers who are looking to find someone permanent and students have to settle for odd jobs or labour jobs and cannot work in the domain of their education and skills. To provide equal opportunities to the international students, they should be allowed to work unrestricted hours.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">The economic well being of Australia is dependant on how much foreign skilled migrants Australia attract per year to assist with the GDP growth and fill a needed annuals skills shortage. Many Australians and residents (about 30% according to ABS statistics 2021) were born overseas. To bring aged parent to Australia the pathways take very long time up to 30 years of processing time, parents from overseas don't get Medicare Coverage for Aged Parents in Australia. This puts financial hardship on Australians citizens from migrants background and Australia foreign residents to pay for Private health insurance that covers their parents whom in many cultures must be looked after by children. Australians from overseas background and migrants pay full tax and medicare levy, they should be able to get medicare service for their parents specially with the long waiting lists of parent visas. Others can argue against wasting tax payers money on foreign parents who are not productive or benefiting the Australian Community, it is worth mentioning that foreigners (migrants under various visas) contribute to the Australian economic wellbeing according to Henry Sherrell is a Policy Analyst for the Migration Council of Australia "Australia's projected population will be 38 million by 2050 and migration will be contributing $1,625 billion (1.6 trillion) to Australia's GDP."</span>

Our financial situation will change drastically when we declare a relationship, we lose our independence and pension. Why do our disabilities have a price tag? We already lack independence and control of our lives. 5.2% of our community have lost their lives to suicide due to feeling like a burden. What is stopping the government funding remaining the same regardless of one's relationship status? DSP base rate is $1026.50 a fortnight. Statistics and data reports say the average annual income is around $55,310 per year after tax. Disability support pension participants earn $24,624 annually. That is a $30,686 gap from the average earnings. If declared in a relationship, participants would be dependent once again on someone else to get by in life while struggling on one income at an average of $55,310 per year. Those statistics is the average for one persons income, how is that supposed to support two? DSP yearly income doesn't even make a dent in the average annual income for Australians. If you take the DSP yearly income and add it to the average annual income of a full time employee after tax you will get $79,310, significantly under the average annual income for a household which would sit around $85,895 after tax.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Online harassment has become a serious problem and one that affects Australian women and girls at higher rates than the global average (Plan International). According to the Australia Institute trolling also has a significant economic cost with a loss of productivity calculated in 2019 to be up to $3.7b. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Despite the fact that online harassment affects 1 in 3 Australians little is being done to address it. Police remain unwilling to lay charges under the criminal code for using a carriage service to menace and harass and increased powers granted to the eSafety Commissioner in 2022 only provide for the most extreme cases of online abuse. In cases of sustained bullying, intimidation and harassment there is no framework in place that protects and compensates victims while holding perpetrators to account. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2014 the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) recommended the creation of a Commonwealth Harassment Act to clarify existing criminal offences for harassment and to provide for a new statutory tort of harassment that would enable victims to seek civil remedies. This has been ignored. Similar acts are in place in the UK and NZ and have been effective in both punishing and deterring would-be harassers. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Human Rights Commission has recommended that Australia adopt a national Human Rights Act. Of particular concern, given the human rights abuses Australians faced during the pandemic, the AHRC states in their position paper: "Governments are also required to . . . take measures to prevent, treat and control epidemic and endemic diseases . . . . A government cannot justify its non-compliance with the core obligations set out above. (Page 121)" A Human Rights Act would make it a human right to be tyrannised by the government. It is not the role of government to control the spread of diseases with very low fatality rates, like Covid. It is not a human right to not get sick. Countries with a Bill of Rights or Charter of Rights did not fare better during the pandemic. Canada committed some of the most atrocious human rights abuses, freezing the bank accounts of political opponents. Australia does not need legislation outlining the rights of its citizens. Rights are not something bestowed upon us by the government. </span>

Yet Ronald Taylor 20863 RAN has NOT been recognised for his ultimate self-sacrifice and extreme devotion to his duty. He has been denied this award. Non-recognition for his bravery is an injustice. We should be ashamed of ourselves if we sit back and accept the decision made. Again, he deserves the highest award for his bravery. I urge that this decision be overturned. One can only be proud of those that paid the ultimate sacrifice. Ronald Taylor however stayed till the end attacking the enemy after the 'Abandon Ship' order was received, the captain of B gun, Leading Seaman Taylor, ordered his two remaining gun's crew to join the rafts. He remained at his gun, determined to fight on by himself; he trained the gun ahead of the leading enemy ship (cont. p88 of HMAS Yarra new edition 2020.) Survivors from the HMAS Yarra stated that he scored a hit on the leading cruiser and that he might have also obtained a hit on a destroyer. At the end of the day, Ronald Taylor did not choose to leave his post. He refused to join his crew and abandon ship and have the chance of survival.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Recent high-profile hacking incidents of well-known companies, have caused the security and privacy of millions of Australian customers to be put at risk, following large-scale data breaches. It is unacceptable that consumers should suffer the consequences of these scandalous corporate security failures, if a company cannot reasonably secure their data assets, nor be trusted regarding long-term data retention. Current laws do not go far enough to ensure consumer security and there is little punishment for corporate breaches. This must be rectified. Therefore, we ask that all companies be required to: 1) Securely segment, heavily encrypt, or remove all personal data from their databases when it is no longer required for identification purposes; and 2) When a consumer is no longer a customer of the business, ALL personal data must be removed within a short time frame (21 days) and consumers be notified by the business or company, that this action will occur by a set date. These measures would assist in the future prevention of identity theft, fraud and credit scams, with less personal data being stored for extended periods of time.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to pass legislation to implement new laws and regulations to protect customer privacy as a fundamental human right, ensuring companies are held to the highest standard on data management. We urge the House to ensure these measures are adopted and enforced, to better safeguard and protect our personal data from exploitation. Secure Data Retention—Protect Consumers' Personal Information. Thankyou.</span>

If a woman is unable to drive ever, is unable to hold down a job that she wants and can't study or survive on her own then she can't be expected to be pregnant on her own. It's her body doing the lifting, it's her body that has to put up with the risks and society doesn't offer enough for what it demands and expects of its women. Until this country is properly run, and functioning at a much higher standard women should be allowed to control their own sex organs. Being a woman and a woman who is of child bearing age causes a lot of distress on the woman and affects her ability to survive and even get educated or employed. Men nowadays are awful and you can't rely on them when you're pregnant or any other time tbh and fair. The laws are in favour of men's OxyContin and not in the best interests of women or children. As a child of single mother I am unable and unwilling to ever be pregnant as I can't drive. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 27 September 2022 regarding Petition EN4090 and 6 February 2023 regarding Petition EN4588 asking the House of Representatives to stop the Digital Identity Legislation and cease attempts to mandate Digital ID via myGov.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government shares the petitioners' passion for ensuring that Australians have their privacy and security protected.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government's Digital ID system is a simple, safe and secure way for Australians to choose to verify their identity and prove who they are online.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Digital ID program has been underway since 2015 and is available to use today with over 10 million Australians already choosing to create a Digital ID through myGovID.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These Digital IDs are being used along with over 1.5 million Australian businesses to access over 125 government services online. Digital ID improves access to services (particularly in remote areas) because it lets people apply for things like Tax File Numbers or Centrelink services entirely online, without travelling sometimes very long distances to a government shopfront.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Digital ID provides an optional way for people to access services without repeatedly providing their identity documents. This reduces the amount of data held by organisations on people using Digital ID, meaning that their data is safer from being hacked.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Digital ID system (the System) follows a 'privacy by design' approach, with strong privacy and consumer protections. This includes security features which undergo rigorous assessment and testing. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Providers within the System must be accredited under the Trusted Digital Identity Framework and meet strict requirements to protect users' privacy and security, and control against fraud.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This is important to safeguard the system with high privacy, consumer and governance standards and ensure the trust and confidence of Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the petitioners point out, I also understand that even with these protections in place, not everyone would want a Digital ID. It is important that Australians understand Digital ID is not mandatory. It is completely voluntary and based on consent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians can keep using government services the same way they do now—whether that's online, on the phone or in person at a government shopfront.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government is committed to the success of Digital ID and the protections it offers to access government services online in a secure way, including safeguarding the data and personal information of Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I will continue to consult with the community on these important reforms, and I thank you for bringing these petitions to my attention. I trust that this response provides the signatories assurance in the Government's Digital ID Program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN4096 requesting the repatriation of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) gold holdings held at the Bank of England (BoE).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The RBA has processes in place to ensure that its specified gold bars are maintained appropriately at the BoE, which is the world's second largest gold repository and a globally respected institution. These include:</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Audits of the RBA's gold processes, including gold holdings at the BoE. The RBA audited its gold holdings at the BoE most recently in April 2022.

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 November 2022, enclosing Petition EN4340, with five signatures, concerning the stay period for Temporary Graduate (subclass 485) visa (TGV) holders who remained in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you may be aware, prior to the COVID-19 international travel restrictions which came into effect in March 2020, individuals were generally limited to just one TGV in a lifetime as a primary holder.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGV Replacement stream was made available, to take into consideration the number of visa holders who lost time in Australia due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, and in recognition of the important contribution these visa holders make to Australian society.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Furthermore, an additional pathway has been provided for TGV holders who were in Australia throughout the pandemic period and are not eligible for the Replacement stream. These visa holders may be eligible for the COVID-19 Pandemic Event (subclass 408) visa with a two year stay period. This visa aims to support those already contributing to the Australian labour force. Applicants need to meet eligibility criteria, including lodging their application 90 days before their TGV expires, or 28 days after their TGV expires. More information can be located on the Department of Home Affairs' website at: https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/temporary-graduate-485.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Government has announced it will increase the duration of stay by two years for TGV, for graduates with select bachelor and higher level degrees. This measure will make Australia's post study offering highly attractive, facilitating longer stays onshore with generous work rights.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Tigray</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email regarding the petition on the conflict in Tigray, northern Ethiopia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government welcomed the 2 November 2022 peace agreement between the Ethiopian Government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front and continues to encourage all parties to seize this opportunity to build an enduring peace in Ethiopia. During the course of the conflict, Australia regularly voiced concerns over human rights violations, and the impact on humanitarian assistance. We continue to encourage comprehensive human rights investigations leading to justice and accountability, and all parties to work together to build a lasting peace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is encouraged by the resumption of humanitarian deliveries and of government services in areas impacted by the conflict. We are also monitoring reports of the withdrawal of Eritrean military units from towns in Tigray. Australia has consistently called on Eritrea to cease its involvement in the conflict.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We note the petition requests Australia consider an intake of Tigrayan refugees. Australia's Humanitarian Program intake draws from a range of nationalities, ethnic and religious groups, reflecting the displacement arising from conflict and persecution in many areas of the world. The Program operates flexibly to respond to evolving humanitarian situations and global resettlement needs. It seeks to balance responses to emergency situations, while providing places for other caseloads in need of resettlement across the world, in line with advice from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). A total of 13,750 places in 2022-23 will ensure we can provide permanent resettlement to those most in need, and provide appropriate support for the travel and resettlement of refugees and others requiring Australia's protection.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Any person who believes they meet the requirements for a humanitarian visa and wishes to seek Australia's assistance can make an application. This, of course, includes ethnic Tigrayan Ethiopian nationals. Each application is considered on its individual merit. Priority is given to the most vulnerable applicants who are assessed as refugees by the UNHCR and formally referred to Australia for resettlement, and those proposed by an immediate family member.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is supporting agencies on the ground to deliver lifesaving assistance for the people of Tigray. Since September 2022, we have committed $25 million in funding to help meet the needs of vulnerable people in Ethiopia and neighbouring countries in the Horn of Africa. We have committed more than $232 million in funding to the World Food Programme since 2021-22, to respond to global food insecurity hotspots. The Australian Government will continue to use trusted partners to deliver vital humanitarian support in Ethiopia and elsewhere.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We will also continue to prioritise our non-emergency support for Ethiopia and Eritrea to programs administered by local community organisations, Australian NGOs and multilateral agencies. Australia does not currently have an autonomous sanctions regime on Ethiopia or Eritrea. However, we keep our autonomous sanctions under regular review.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I thank the Petitions Committee for highlighting the situation facing the people of Tigray in Ethiopia and for the requests.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition 4543 on replacing the Queen's portrait on the $5 banknote with an image of the National War Memorial. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Reserve Bank has decided to update the $5 banknote to feature a new design that honours the culture and history of the First Australians. This new design will replace the portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. The other side of the $5 banknote will continue to feature the Australian Parliament.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This decision by the Reserve Bank Board follows consultation with the Australian Government, which supports this change.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Bank will consult with First Australians in designing the $5 banknote. The new banknote will take a number of years to be designed and printed. In the meantime, the current $5 banknote will continue to be issued. It will be able to be used even after the new banknote is issued.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 February 2023 regarding Petition number EN4610 requesting the House revoke protection for companies responsible for supplying COVID-19 vaccines to the Commonwealth on the grounds that those companies 'lied and covered up' information on the efficacy of mRNA vaccines. Additionally, the petitioners have also requested that persons injured by COVID-19 vaccines be allowed to pursue legal recourse.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is no scientifically or medically recognised evidence that indicates the vaccines registered in Australia for COVID-19 are not safe and efficacious for the overwhelming majority of individuals. All vaccines that are available for administration under the national roll-out in Australia have been evaluated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in accordance with the legislation. Further, decisions made in relation to the roll-out have been supported by advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth acknowledges that, in very rare instances, individuals may experience adverse effects from COVID-19 vaccines. In recognition of those instances, the Commonwealth has established the COVID-19 Claims Compensation Scheme (Scheme). The Scheme provides a mechanism for individuals who have experienced an adverse effect relating to seven clinical conditions identified by the TGA to claim compensation. The Scheme does not require claimants to establish fault.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Alternatively, an individual may decide to pursue litigation against a vaccine manufacturer at their discretion. There is no basis for the view expressed by the petitioners that an individual is 'not free to pursue legal recourse'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your referral dated 6 March 2023, concerning the petition calling for a Royal Commission into housing and homelessness in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I would first like to pass on my gratitude to the organisers and signatories of this petition for taking steps in an effort to improve the lives of the many Australians facing housing insecurity and homelessness. The Albanese Government understands the urgency of addressing these concerns and is committed to working with the states and stakeholders across the housing system to improve housing and homelessness outcomes for Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I recognise the signatories to this petition have called for the establishment of a National Housing Strategy. I am pleased to share that the Government is developing a National Housing and Homelessness Plan (the Plan) to identify the short, medium and long-term steps that can be taken to address housing and homelessness issues in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Plan will be developed in collaboration with key stakeholders including state and territory governments, local government, not for profit and civil society organisations, industry bodies, superannuation funds and other experts in housing, finance and urban development.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petition has detailed the need to allow Australians to provide statements about their lived experiences of homelessness and housing insecurity. The Plan will present an opportunity for people to provide statements through an extensive consultation process.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to the email of 14 February 2022 from the former Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions, Mr Ken O'Dowd MP, to the former Minister for Communications, the Hon Paul Fletcher MP, regarding Petition EN3554, requesting the Government privatise the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Following the May 2022 Federal Election, a new Standing Committee on Petitions was appointed for the 47th Parliament in September 2022. The petition has since been referred to me as the current Minister for Communications. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Australian Government provides an overall level of funding to the ABC and SBS, Parliament has guaranteed the broadcasters' content and editorial independence. Under this arrangement, the manner in which the ABC and SBS present their programming is a matter for each broadcaster's Board and executive.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that the ABC published a statement on 11 August 2021 about the payment of Ms Milligan's legal fees, stating that this decision arose from particular and exceptional circumstances. This statement can be found on the ABC's website at about.abc.net.au/statements/abc-statement-on-louise-milligan-and-andrew-laming/.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The national broadcasters remain accountable to Parliament through annual reports, corporate plans, financial and performance audits, and in appearances before parliamentary committees. The ABC and SBS Boards are also required to develop codes of practice on programming matters and lodge this code with the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Concerned members of the public may engage with the ABC and SBS by contacting the broadcasters directly. This is the best way to make sure the broadcasters are aware of any concerns and are given the opportunity to respond.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Complaints about broadcast content can be escalated to the ACMA if audience members are not satisfied with the response they receive from the broadcasters or have not received a response within 60 days. Information about making a complaint to the ACMA about the content broadcast on ABC or SBS is on the ACMA's website at www.acma.gov.au.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email regarding a petition to include Ukraine into the Australian Generalized System of Tariff Preferences (ASTP).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Acknowledging the hardship facing the people of Ukraine, Australia is providing duty-free access for Ukrainian goods to support Ukraine's economy in the face of Russian aggression. For a 12 month period from 4 July 2022, imports that are the produce or manufacture of Ukraine have duty-free access to Australia. This access was granted through a mechanism provided for under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Customs Act 1901. </span>Future arrangements following the initial 12 month period are under active consideration. Potential changes to the ASTP, including to the list of eligible countries, would need to be considered as part of a broader review.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are proud to have contributed important defence, economic and humanitarian assistance. Australian assistance committed to date is approximately $680 million, more than $500 million of which has been military assistance. This support has included Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicles, M777 Howitzers, anti-armour weapons, ammunition, unmanned aerial systems and a range of personal equipment. Australia also provided $65 million of humanitarian assistance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is Australia's objective to empower Ukraine to resolve this conflict on its own terms. We will continue to consider all formal requests from Ukraine for assistance.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 28 November 2022 on behalf of five signatories, concerning Petition EN4527 -Federal Legislation for Production and Distribution of Adult Media, particularly around the creation of uniform federal adult media production and distribution laws.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Classification Scheme (the Scheme) provides for the classification of adult media content. The Scheme is a co-operative arrangement established and maintained by agreement between the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments in Australia. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 </span>(the Act) provides for a National Classification Code (the Code) and Classification Guidelines for films, computer games and publications (the Guidelines). The content permitted at each classification level (e.g. G, PG, M) is determined by the Code and the Guidelines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Scheme is designed to provide consumers and parents with information about publications, films and computer games to allow them to make informed decisions about appropriate entertainment material for themselves and those in their care. The Scheme is based on the principle that adults should be able to read, hear, see and play what they want, while recognising that minors should be protected from material likely to harm them and that everyone should be protected from offensive unsolicited material.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Scheme, films, computer games and certain publications must be classified before being made available to consumers. The Commonwealth is responsible for the classification of completed content. Issues relating to content production are outside the Commonwealth's remit under the Scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory governments have responsibility for enforcing powers related to the sale, exhibition and advertising of classifiable content. Under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergovernmental Agreement on Censorship 1995</span> (the IGA) states and territories are to have their own legislation for enforcement of the Act. In recent years the Commonwealth has taken an increased role in the enforcement of online materials, including through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Online Safety Act 2021.</span></span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span style="font-style:italic;">
                </span>The X18+ classification is a legally restricted classification for sexually explicit material between consenting adults. This classification applies only to films, including DVDs and videos, and is strictly regulated. No depictions of violence, sexual or otherwise, or coercion are permitted. There are also prohibitions on demeaning depictions, fetishes or depictions of people who are under 18, look under 18 or are aged over 18 but portrayed as minors. Material which offends against standards or morality generally accepted by reasonable adults, such as bestiality, is given a Refused Classification and is not legally available for display or sale in Australia. Further details can be found in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guidelines for the Classification of Films 2012.</span></span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Code and Guidelines outline what content is permissible at the X 18+ classification rating, each state and territory has its own legislation outlining what material can be sold, displayed or published, including X 18+ content.</span>

                <span style="font-style:italic;">Restricted classification </span>is a legally restricted classification for publications which commonly contain images of sexualised nudity.

                </span>As with films, publications which offend against standards or morality generally accepted by reasonable adults are given a Refused Classification and are not legally available for display or sale in Australia.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Online Safety Act 2021 </span>came into effect on 23 January 2022. It supports Australians online by providing the eSafety Commissioner with powers to request or require the take down of illegal and restricted online content. Most adult media content, like pornography, falls under the eSafety Commissioner's powers to respond to material that is, or is likely to be, Xl8+ or Rl8+ material. The Commissioner can issue a removal notice to a service provider if it is hosting Xl8+ material in Australia, and can require service providers to ensure that Rl8+ material hosted in Australia can only be accessed by adults.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has recently announced improvements to the Scheme while further comprehensive reforms are considered. As options for reform are developed there will be further opportunities to consult so that the Scheme can remain a trusted source of information for Australian consumers about what they and those in their care read, hear, see and play.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to protecting Australians' personal information and strengthening privacy laws. The Attorney-General's Department recently completed a review of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Privacy Act 1988 </span>(Privacy Act Review) which will inform reforms to ensure the Privacy Act remains fit-for-purpose, supports an innovative economy and responds to new challenges in the digital age.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Defamation law reform is also currently being progressed by the Australian Government and state and territory governments. In Australia, a person may be sued for defamation if they publish a statement that is harmful to another person's reputation. Where defamation is made out, the aggrieved person may be eligible for damages for harm. Each state and territory has enacted model defamation laws, which supplement the common law of defamation. A key area of reform relates to the liability of digital platforms for defamatory content published online. More information about this work is available at: Review of model defamation provisions (nsw.gov.au).</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 February 2023 enclosing Petition EN4601, with 19 signatures, concerning Australia's treatment of asylum seekers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you are aware, the Government has provided a permanent visa pathway to existing Temporary Protection visa (TPV) and Safe Haven Enterprise visa (SHEV) holders. This permanent visa pathway, through the permanent Resolution of Status (RoS) (subclass 851) visa, has been made available from 14 February 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">People granted a permanent RoS visa will be afforded the same rights and benefits as all permanent humanitarian residents. Providing a permanent visa pathway to existing TPV and SHEV holders will empower them to move forward with their lives and to more fully contribute to Australia, gain secure employment, grow businesses, study more easily, sponsor eligible family members under the family stream of the Migration Program to Australia and pursue a pathway to Australian citizenship.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to implementing this measure in an efficient and effective manner to ensure the majority of the caseload are granted a RoS visa within 12 months of processing commencement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government remains committed to delivering orderly and legal pathways to Australia through robust migration and humanitarian programs. As such, the Government has committed to maintaining Operation Sovereign Borders, including regional processing arrangements. Under this approach, anyone who attempts to travel to Australia by boat without a valid visa will be turned back to their point of departure, returned to their home country, or transferred to a regional processing country for assessment of their protection claims.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is committed to its international obligations set out in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol and other international human rights conventions to which it is a party. Australia does not return individuals to situations where they face persecution or a real risk of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary deprivation of life or the application of the death penalty.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 February 2023 enclosing Petition EN4602, with 164 signatures, concerning the urgent prioritisation of Iranian visa applicants.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has a long history of providing resettlement for refugees and others who are displaced as a result of conflict, persecution and human rights abuses. Since the end of World War 11, Australia has successfully settled more than 930,000 refugees and others in humanitarian need.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is committed to compassionate and flexible Humanitarian and Settlement Programs that meet our international protection obligations, and position Australia as a global leader in international resettlement efforts. A program of 17,875 places in the 2022-23 Humanitarian Program will ensure we can provide permanent resettlement to those most in need, and provide appropriate support for the travel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Any person, including Iranian nationals, who believe they meet the requirements for a humanitarian visa and wishes to seek Australia's assistance can make an application. Each application is considered on its individual merit using current and comprehensive information on circumstances in the relevant country.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Priority is given to the most vulnerable applicants who are assessed as refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and formally referred to Australia for resettlement, and those proposed by an immediate family member (i.e. spouses and minor aged children).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's Humanitarian Program is designed primarily to assist people who have left their home country because of persecution or severe human rights abuses, and who have no options for return or for resettlement in another country. Iranian nationals have consistently been in the top ten offshore resettlement caseloads over the last five program years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You may also be aware the Australian Government has recently provided a permanent visa pathway to existing Temporary Protection visa (TPV) and Safe Haven Enterprise visa (SHEV) holders. This permanent visa pathway has been made available through the permanent Resolution of Status (RoS) (subclass 851) visa from 14 February 2023 and will include any Iranian nationals who held or applied for a TPV or SHEV before 14 February 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand the desire to obtain quick outcomes on visa applications for those facing humanitarian concerns, and I recognise the desire for special visa pathways for those facing hardship. While there are no special processing arrangements for Iranians, reducing the number of on-hand visa applications is a priority for the Government and will allow the Department of Home Affairs to consider applications which were not prioritised under previous Ministerial Directions.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 February 2023 concerning Ministerial Petition EN4647—<span style="font-style:italic;">No to nuclear-capable 8-52 bombers, AUKUS, and Marine Rotational</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Forces-Darwin. </span>I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government always makes decisions in our national interests. In a deteriorating strategic environment, we must take a clear eyed approach to the defence of these interests. The Government has to be willing—and have the capability- to act on our own terms. Our Alliance with the United States is central to this endeavour. It affords us with capability, technology and intelligence we could not acquire on our own.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For over ten years, our force posture cooperation with the United States—including through the Marine Rotational Force-Darwin and the visit of United States strategic assets to Australia (such as B-52 bombers)—has made a practical contribution to regional stability and our own security and capability. United States bomber aircraft have been visiting Australia since the early 1980s and have conducted training in Australia since 2005. Successive Australian Governments have understood and respected the longstanding United States policy of neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons on particular platforms.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In parallel with our Alliance collaboration, the trilateral AUKUS partnership will enhance Australia's ability to deter threats in our region and pursue our sovereign interests. Australia's acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines represents the best option to meet our strategic and defence capability requirements over the coming decades. It will strengthen our ability to work with regional partners in support of stability and security.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is a State Party to both the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty (Treaty of Rarotonga) and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We will continue to meet Australia's non-proliferation obligations and commitments under both treaties as well as our safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency. While Australia is not a State Party to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, we share its ambition of a world without nuclear weapons. Australia will continue to comply with our international obligations and the United States understands and respects these obligations with respect to nuclear weapons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises the emphasis we must place on our relations with the region, including stabilising relations with China. During Foreign Minister Wong's visit to Beijing in December 2022, both countries agreed to restart dialogue. In our approach to China, we will continue to look for avenues of cooperation where they exist, and we are prepared to disagree where we must. Australia supports peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and we do not want to see any unilateral change to the status quo.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 6 March 2023 regarding petition number EN4656.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Pharmacists are not authorised practitioners for the purposes of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) nor are they authorised to prescribe under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Therefore, pharmacists are not listed on the Application for a Medicare provider number and/or prescriber number for allied health and non-medical health professionals. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A decision of the Australian Government is required to expand MBS access to a profession. Such a decision typically takes account of a range factors which may include but are not limited to the scope of practice of the profession, the potential capacity of the profession to address an unmet need of patients, the potential interaction with any state and territory funding arrangements, whether appropriate credentialling and continuing professional development arrangements are in place for the profession, and whether the MBS is the most appropriate funding mechanism.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Similarly, a decision of Government is required to expand PBS access to a profession. Amendments to the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Health Act 1953 </span>would be required to recognise pharmacists as authorised prescribers, and the independent Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) would need to make a positive recommendation for specified pharmaceutical benefits that could be prescribed by a pharmacist within their scope of practice. I note that the Pharmacy Board of Australia does not consider autonomous prescribing to be within the scope of practice of a registered pharmacist and would require additional regulation via an endorsement for scheduled medicines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently pharmacists are able to supply 52 (Pharmacy only) and 53 (Pharmacist only) medicines in all jurisdictions and supply and administer a range of 54 (Prescription only) vaccinations, which varies between jurisdictions, without a prescription. Several jurisdictions have announced trials of pharmacist diagnosis and prescribing, including in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. The Government will monitor the progress of these trials with interest, noting that details are not finalised for some of these trials.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 6 March 2023 regarding EN4682 requesting the Australian Government to take stronger action against the Iranian regime to stop the execution of protesters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I share the deep concerns regarding the execution of protesters by the Iranian regime.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Deputy Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister condemned in the strongest terms the death sentences and executions of protesters in the Joint Statement on the Second Australia-France Foreign and Defence Ministerial consultations on 30 January and the Australia-UK Ministerial Consultations Joint Statement on 3 February. The Attorney-General and the Foreign Minister wrote to our Iranian counterparts reaffirming Australia's opposition to the death penalty on 19 and 17 January respectively.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 16 December 2022, in a joint statement with the New Zealand and Canadian Foreign Ministers, the Foreign Minister called on Iran to immediately establish a moratorium to halt all executions. Australia will continue to raise these concerns directly with Iran's representative in Canberra, through our Embassy in Tehran and in multilateral forums.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has been integral to building pressure internationally and was at the forefront of efforts to remove Iran from the Commission for the Status of Women. Australia co- sponsored and advocated for the successful Human Rights Council resolution for the establishment of an independent fact-finding mission to investigate human rights violations in Iran.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government has imposed sanctions on 56 individuals and 23 entities since the protests began, including Iran's Morality Police, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps's research, manufacturing and funding arms, and senior Iranian law enforcement and military officials.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government has taken stronger action against Iran on human rights than any previous Australian government. We will continue to deliberately and strategically put pressure on the Iranian regime to uphold human rights.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 6 March 2023 regarding petition EN4725, which concerns the access of Schedule 8 medicines for chronic pain sufferers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the distress and suffering of those struggling to access appropriate treatment for their chronic pain.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 8 pain medicines typically belong to a class of medicines called opioids, which have been responsible for far more deaths and hospitalisations due to poisoning in Australia each year than illegal opioids such as heroin. While there have not been any major changes to scheduling of opioids in Schedule 8 recently, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) acted in 2018 to reduce the harm caused by opioid medicines. These changes included requiring the sponsors of opioid medicines to:</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">update prescribing indications.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It has been shown that for most people with long-term non-cancer pain, opioid medications do not provide clinically important improvement in pain or function compared with other treatments. Instead, they carry significant risk of harm, even when used as directed. However, the changes by the TGA acknowledge that there remains a need for ongoing opioid use for those where it has been deemed clinically appropriate. For this reason, the regulatory changes have not led to a ban on prescribing opioids to any category of patient.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Against the backdrop of changes to the regulation of opioids and increased awareness of the latest evidence about its benefits and risks, there are several reasons why prescribers may have changed their prescribing practices.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">States and territories have increased the monitoring of the use of opioids. In particular, the Commonwealth, and states and territories have been working together to implement the National Real Time Prescription Monitoring system to reduce the misuse of controlled medicines in Australia. One of the goals of this initiative is to limit 'prescription shopping'—those visiting several doctors, including emergency departments, for the same prescriptions of a controlled medicine with the intent to misuse. However, each state or territory remains responsible for the management of controlled medicines in its jurisdiction.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA also anticipates that prescribers have been reflecting on their opioid prescribing practice to comply with professional standards, and ensure that, when either initiating or continuing to prescribe an opioid, they have had a discussion with their patient about the benefits and risks. Whether opioids are appropriate for a patient with pain will continue to be a clinical decision for the individual prescriber. Prescribers are bound by professional standards and are accountable to an independent regulator. The TGA has published a variety of resources such as research, tools and information on pain management services for consumers and health professionals that may be useful at www.tga.gov.au and searching for 'opioid resources'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">By way of background, medicines are classified into Schedules in the Poisons Standard according to the risk of harm and the level of access control required to protect public health and safety. Scheduling decisions are made by a senior medical officer of the TGA acting as a delegate of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Aged Care, not by me or another member of the Government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The implementation of the Poisons Standard is given legal effect through relevant state and territory legislation. This means that it is ultimately a matter for individual state and territory governments to decide the precise controls over access to prescription medicines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If sufficient new evidence comes to light that the current scheduling of certain opioids in Schedule 8 is not appropriate, the TGA could reconsider their scheduling to ensure the need to protect the public is balanced appropriately with the access to clinical benefits. Any member of the public can make an application with sufficient supportive evidence to propose changing the scheduling of substances in the Poisons Standard.</span>

In fact, after the acknowledgement of country and prayers, the presentation of petitions is the very first item of business in the sitting week—emphasising the importance of petitions as a way for Australian citizens and residents to directly make a request of the House of Representatives. When the House doesn't meet on a Monday of a sitting week, petitions are not usually presented by the Petitions Committee. I note that individual members may also present petitions on behalf of their constituents.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But given that the House has not met for several weeks, the Petitions Committee agreed to seek leave to present petitions and ministers' responses at a different time than usual. Today I've presented 55 petitions and 31 ministerial responses to petitions previously presented. Importantly, this presentation allows for the petitions to be referred to the relevant minister for a response without undue delay, and for the ministerial responses to be provided to the petitioners and published on the parliamentary website. I thank the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOOD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  I am in continuation. I was speaking about schedule 4, headed 'Independent children's lawyers'. Schedule 4 of the Family Law Amendment Bill 2023 deals with independent children's lawyers and would establish a requirement to meet with children over the age of five unless there are exceptional circumstances. However, as with other parts of this bill, it must be road tested. How will it affect the work of independent children's lawyers in remote and rural areas? How does a child communicate that they do not want to meet? Does that need to come through a parent? These are significant practical real-world issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 5 of the bill is headed 'Case management and procedure'. Among other things, schedule 5 introduces new harmful proceedings orders to prevent a vexatious litigant from filling and serving new applications without first obtaining leave from the court. It also includes a new overarching purpose for the family practice and procedure provisions. As with other parts of the bill, while the intent is sound as a matter of principle, the measures warrant examination. For example, while we welcome clarifying that family law procedures should promote safety, the Law Council rightly argues that family law should aim to minimise acrimony.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 6 of the bill is headed 'Communications of details of family law proceedings'. Schedule 6 of the bill redrafts section 121 of the Family Law Act to clarify restrictions around public communication of family law proceedings. This is a redrafting of provisions that prevent people from publishing the details of family law proceedings. As with other parts of the bill, there are questions worth exploring: for example, is it appropriate for the bill to protect professional expert witnesses?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 7 of the bill is headed 'Family report writers'. Schedule 7 deals with family report writers. The most notable part of the schedule is the suggestion that the government could set mandatory standards and requirements in regulations. The importance of consistency in standards of practice is rightly acknowledged, but, as the Law Council and others have pointed out, it is unclear what the practical implications will be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 8 of the bill is headed 'Review of operation of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Act 2021'. Schedule 8 is a surprise last-minute amendment on which the government chose not to consult. It brings forward the date for the review of the merger of the Federal Circuit Court of Australia and the Family Court of Australia by two years. Instead of giving the Federal Circuit and Family Court a reasonable period to bed down the merger, the Attorney has, unannounced, chosen to bring the review date forward by two years, to the end of this parliamentary term. One would be forgiven for thinking this is a cynical attempt by the Attorney-General to leave open the doorway to relitigate the merger of the courts as an election issue in 2025. We reject that type of optimism. Changes to family law systems should aim to reduce the pain, costs and time associated with separation. It should not be a place of political pride.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 9 of the bill is headed 'Dual appointments'. Schedule 9 deals with dual appointments to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia and the Family Court of Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the coalition agrees with the intent behind many of the measures in this bill, but the bill is not yet in a position where the coalition can support it. The problems are well recognised, but we are concerned that the solutions have not adequately been tested or will go further than is needed. These are not the sorts of changes that warrant simply being waved through. We will support the bill going to a committee for careful scrutiny. Ideally, the committee hearing would have already happened before the second reading debate. We should already have heard, for example, from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities about how the measures in this bill will affect them on the ground before the bill is debated in this place. It's a shame that the government has chosen to progress the bill in this way. This bill warrants a very careful and public examination through a parliamentary inquiry so Australians can develop an informed view on whether the changes in this bill do what they are intended to do. The coalition will settle its final position on the bill in light of those public hearings and committee evidence.</span>

It is the culmination of work started under the former coalition government to ensure that family courts have the information they need when making orders in parenting matters. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has a strong record when it comes to improving interaction between the child protection and family law systems. In the 2019-20 budget, funding was provided to co-locate state and territory family safety officials in family law courts to improve information sharing between the family law, family violence and child protection systems. After the Australian Law Reform Commission handed down its report <span style="font-style:italic;">Family </span><span style="font-style:italic;">law for the future</span>, the coalition agreed with the recommendation that there should be a national information-sharing framework implemented. The framework that came out of the Australian Law Reform Commission report was intended to guide the sharing of information about the safety, welfare and wellbeing of families and children between the family law, family violence and child protection systems. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That work progressed in partnership with all jurisdictions through the Council of Attorneys-General and its successor bodies. In November 2021, it resulted in the endorsement by Commonwealth, state and territory governments of the National Strategic Framework for Information Sharing between the Family Law and Family Violence and Child Protection Systems. The objective of the national framework was very clear:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The objective of the National Framework is to promote the safety and wellbeing of adults and children affected by family violence, child abuse and neglect, and support informed and appropriate decision-making in circumstances where there is, or may be, a risk of family violence, child abuse or neglect. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the features of the national framework was a shift away from subpoenas issued by the parties to a family law dispute. Instead, the framework moved towards targeted requests for information and court initiated orders. Rather than relying on parties to issue subpoenas, the framework was intended to empower courts to access family safety information. To facilitate early and streamlined information sharing, it proposed a new form of order, referred to as a short-form order, to ascertain whether a state or territory agency holds information that would inform decision-making and to give an indication of the nature and extent of the risk or records held as well as the involvement of the respondent agency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the national framework, which was endorsed in November 2021, envisaged a broad range of state and territory agencies would be information-sharing agencies. It expressly included state and territory child protection or child welfare departments and state and territory policing agencies and firearms registries, but it also envisaged flexibility to include other bodies in the future. This could see the inclusion of state and territory corrections or youth justice bodies and even non-government organisations, such as specialist family violence services, participating in the scheme. This was intended to give effect to the principle that if an individual's safety is a concern in a matter before a court all relevant information should be before that court to ensure decision-making is fully informed. The coalition is pleased to see that those factors are reflected in this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill achieves four main things. First, it introduces two different types of information-sharing orders: both a short-form order, which is called an order for particulars, and an order to produce those documents or information. These provisions replace the existing, more limited information-sharing provision in the Family Law Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, the bill allows the family law courts to obtain a broader range of information than is possible under existing information-sharing arrangements. This recognises that family violence and child abuse and neglect are complex, can take a number of different forms and can impact children even if not directed at them. Family courts should not be unduly limited in the information they take into account when making parenting orders. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, it expressly outlines legal exclusions to information sharing, such as documents that are privileged or information that would endanger a person if disclosed. Fourth, it restricts the issue of subpoenas without leave of the court. In circumstances where an information-sharing order requiring the production of documents has already been made, the bill says that a party can only issue a subpoena with leave. This is intended to reduce duplication of information requests and avoid the cost and time associated with subpoena processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will rely heavily on regulations firstly to prescribe state and territory bodies as information-sharing agencies that can be directed to produce information and secondly to create rules around the production, storage, disclosure and disposal of information. This is in line with the approach envisaged by the national framework. The bill also establishes a requirement to conduct a statutory review within 12 months after the commencement of the scheme. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that far too many family law disputes involve family violence, and this, of course, can have a devastating and long-term impact. We also know that situations can change quickly while a family law matter is progressing through the courts. The information that was put before the court six months ago might not be the information the court needs to make the best possible orders today. A joined-up approach between the family law, family violence and child protection systems is one way to combat this situation, and this bill is a welcome development. I commend the bill to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:12</span>):  I rise to speak on the Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2023. The coalition is supportive of the intent of this bill. It is, however, ironic, given that this bill makes changes to a range of Commonwealth statutes that relate to law enforcement, oversight and related judicial processes, that the scrutiny processes around the bill itself have been less than satisfactory. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill should have been referred in its entirety to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, the PJCIS, for scrutiny. It remains unclear why this did not happen. Instead, only a single technical provision of the bill relating to a change in the name of the South Australian Independent Commission Against Corruption was referred to the PJCIS. Understandably, the PJCIS declined to conduct an inquiry into an inconsequential amendment. It now seems that at the eleventh hour the government has realised its error and, at the urging of the coalition, will subject this bill to further scrutiny. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that such a process of scrutiny is conducted because, while much of the bill is procedural, we are dealing with important and complicated matters relating to national security and criminal law, and there are some substantive changes. Any time that proposed legislation touches on such pieces of legislation as the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act or the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act, as this bill does, it should be subject to careful scrutiny from a parliamentary committee such as the PJCIS to examine how the proposed changes will work in practice. Changes to legislation in these areas are too important not to put them through an appropriate process of scrutiny to understand any issues which may arise. The only way to do this is to hear from the agencies likely to be affected by the legislation. None of us, I'm sure, would want to see any unintended consequences baked into these acts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act allows eligible judges or nominated members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to issue warrants, orders and approvals to use certain covert or coercive investigative powers. To provide oversight to this process, the governments of Victoria and Queensland have established public interest monitors, who can appear at hearings of applications for warrants and essentially act as a contradictor. The current legislation, however, prevents those public interest monitors from making submissions in relation to what are called part 5.3 supervisory orders—these are control orders, extended supervision orders and interim supervision orders—issued under part 5.3 of the Criminal Code, including orders being issued in relation to matters concerning terrorist offenders. The provisions in schedule 8 of this bill before the House will allow the public interest monitors in Victoria and Queensland to make submissions relating to part 5.3 supervisory orders. On the information available to the coalition it is unclear what impact, if any, this would have on those regimes. Of course, that would be an appropriate matter for a parliamentary committee to consider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the House will also amend the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act to close a loophole relating to the obligation imposed on reporting entities to register with AUSTRAC. Currently that obligation can only be enforced if AUSTRAC becomes aware of the failure to register within 12 months of the contravention. In addition, the amendments in schedule 1 will clarify that sensitive AUSTRAC information that is shared with partner agencies cannot then be produced to courts and tribunals by those agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the amendments in schedule 1 will authorise the AUSTRAC chief executive officer to use computer programs, including automated programs, to take non-adverse administrative actions, such as registration renewals. Explanatory materials note the need for sophisticated internal business rules and quality assurance and refer to 'high-risk' decisions. It is again unclear what new risks, if any, would result from these changes, noting that the stated intention is to create efficiencies for AUSTRAC and for regulated entities. Again these provisions would benefit from the scrutiny that a parliamentary committee could provide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendments to the Foreign Evidence Act in schedule 5 of the bill will mean that foreign evidence is no longer required to be certified by a 'judge, magistrate or officer' of the relevant country. Instead, the new provisions will provide that testimony can also be signed or certified by 'a person authorised to administer an oath or affirmation or put a person under an obligation to tell the truth' in or of the foreign country to which the request was made. The effect of this change will be that foreign evidence will be admissible in a wider range of circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendments proposed in schedule 6 of the bill will provide the Attorney-General with a discretionary power to refuse consent to a request or an application for transfer to or from Australia at an earlier stage in the process. This is intended to reduce procedural overheads associated with the international prisoner transfer process. Once again it would be appropriate for a parliamentary committee, such as the PJCIS, to scrutinise this proposed change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Changes in schedule 9 of the bill before the House will allow the commissioner to suspend a person's participation in the National Witness Protection Program in circumstances where the participant requests it or where the commissioner forms the view that the participant has done or intends to do something that would limit their ability to protect and assist the participant. As is the case with the other changes of which I have spoken, scrutiny of this proposed change by a parliamentary committee would be desirable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I repeat my earlier statement that the coalition are in agreement with the intent of the bill which is before the House. We will not oppose this bill, subject only to the evidence that comes out of a committee inquiry. I do state the principle that senators and members should not be asked to make changes to Australia's national security legislation or important parts of the Crimes Act without a full understanding of the impact of those changes. It is necessary and appropriate that members of this place and of the Senate are in a position to be fully informed about the effect of changes that would be made by legislation that we are asked to vote upon. It is for that reason that the coalition believes it is appropriate that the bill, in its totality, should be subject to review by a parliamentary committee, such as the PJCIS. I repeat that while the coalition is supportive of the intent of this bill, naturally we would consider the evidence that comes out of the appropriate parliamentary inquiry in finalising that position.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:20</span>):  The coalition will be supporting the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Child Support Measures) Bill 2023. This bill works to improve debt recovery and help prevent future debts for low-income parents. It therefore will have the coalition's support. In fact, two of the measures in the bill are measures that were previously announced by the former coalition government as part of the 2021-22 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook that were not legislated prior to the last federal election. These coalition measures strengthen Australia's child support framework, and it is pleasing to see the current government recognise the hard work of the former minister in this area by legislating these very important reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former coalition government committed $7.8 million to strengthening child support compliance activities, enabling child support debts to be recovered in a wider range of circumstances. This included allowing Services Australia to dock parents' pay to repay child support in more circumstances, including after a child turns 18, which overturns the existing loophole where it is effectively case closed once a child turns 18. At that point, there are limited ways to recover a debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former coalition government also worked to strengthen the departure prohibition order system, which prevents parents who fail to pay child support from leaving Australia. This is another measure within the bill before us today. The coalition government again worked to give Services Australia discretion in those circumstances to refuse an exemption if they have reason to believe the parent is likely to shirk their responsibilities and fail to pay back the remainder of the debt when they return to Australia. Under the coalition, since July 2017 5,394 parents were issued with a travel ban, enabling the recovery of nearly $100 million and ensuring to a greater extent the wellbeing and economic security of those children who were affected by the relevant family breakdown. It's expected that these changes will recover up to $164 million in debt owed to parents and their children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand that family breakdowns are incredibly difficult, so child support is in place to ensure that, no matter where or with whom they live, children that are affected by family breakdown remain to the greatest extent financially secure. We make no apologies for employing and indeed putting on the table these tough measures to ensure that child support is paid, because, again, parents who shirk their responsibilities are just depriving their own children of the financial support that will ultimately give them a better life. We recognise that most parents do the right thing and fulfil their child support obligations. Since its introduction in 1988, the government has transferred a remarkable $33 billion in child support payments. When parents don't pay their child support on time, we all know in this place that it has a real and material impact on the financial security of single parents and their children. These measures will therefore go some way to closing loopholes and providing Services Australia with additional capabilities to stop those seeking to shirk their responsibility and ultimately to provide for their children—to provide the support that they deserve and need. The coalition remains committed, just as we were when in government, to seeing parents and children receive the financial support they're entitled to. For that reason, we'll commend the government and commend and support this bill in this chamber and in the other place.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282212" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms THWAITES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:24</span>):  This bill, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Child Support Measures) Bill 2023, has the potential to make a really significant difference in the lives of children and families in all of our communities. It is positive to hear that those opposite support the bill, because I'm sure that many in this chamber have constituents who have come to them over the years frustrated and upset with the child support system, asking for our support for a way through. The truth is that we haven't seen a lot of reform in this area, so this reform is a positive step and a step in the right direction, and our government has signalled that there is more to come. We do know that every child support case is different. Everyone has a different set of circumstances. Of course, some people who pay or receive child support do so without encountering any issues. It is a really important system, set up to ensure the best interests of and the best futures for children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's those occasions when we know that the system hasn't worked or isn't working that tell us that we need to look at how we can make things better. When we heard the stories of parents who've suffered financial abuse, including through missing or misrepresented levels of child support payments, our government knew we had to make changes. Those of us in this place who have the opportunity to make these changes to improve the way these systems, which are so important in people's lives, work owe it to the people in our community, to their kids and in fact also to the people who administer these systems—all those people working at Services Australia—to help make the child support system in this country work as well as it can. I'm well aware that often there are not easy fixes for some of the issues encountered in this space, but it is really heartening to know that we have a minister and a government that aren't shying away from changes to the child support system that will help deliver fairer outcomes for separated families. This is important work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will help improve the timely collection of child support owed to parents and help prevent future debt for low-income parents. We know child support is a big system. In the last financial year alone, $3.7 billion in child support payments was transferred between 1.3 million parents for 1.1 million children in Australia. In this bill, our government are proposing three key changes. We are expanding employer withholding, tightening the arrangements around departure prohibition orders and improving income accuracy for low-income parents. These represent the start of reforms of child support in this country that our government will deliver. As I've said, child support is a complex system; it has a lot of variability in it and, of course, people have variability in their circumstances. No one model is ever going to fit every family and their circumstances. So we can't promise that the changes being introduced will sort every issue or will make the change that every single family is looking for, but we do know this will make an important difference for many families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I, like many in this chamber, I'm sure, have had people in my community contact my office with a range of issues relating to child support. There are certainly some consistent themes that I can draw out from the contact. They include confusion about the way the system works, the structure of child support and the assistance that can be provided under that system. People have also pointed out to me the difficulty they find in getting the help they need when payments aren't coming through as expected. Consistency of payments is another concern, and I'm really pleased to see that one of the features of the bill we're debating today will help see child support paid on time, providing that certainty that we all know is so important in our lives and affects what budget a parent has to work with in any given week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there's more to be done beyond the changes being introduced in this bill. Our government is very much aware of the scale of the task to make the child support system work better. We know that many people who pay or receive child support do the right thing. As I said, in many cases the system works as it should. But, for the people it unfortunately doesn't work for, we need to make sure there are strict measures in place so that, wherever possible, parents and kids are getting the child support they're owed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know for a fact that some parents deliberately avoid paying child support or deliberately misrepresent their earnings to avoid paying as much child support as they should. In many cases this kind of behaviour can be a form of financial control and abuse. It can be used against former partners and ultimately, of course, leaves children and the parents caring for them worse off, sometimes with some quite significant repercussions. From conversations I've had with some parents—and again I'm sure others have also had these conversations—I know it is particularly difficult for those who have left abusive partners and now find they're experiencing continued trauma as a result of child support being withheld. I do note the important work of the family law inquiry that was conducted in the 46th Parliament and brought renewed focus to these kinds of issues, as well as other relevant parliamentary inquiries that have highlighted how interwoven some of these issues are, including the family, domestic and sexual violence inquiry I was a member of in the previous parliament. We do know financial security is a serious problem in these areas and it disproportionally affects women. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the beginning of this year our government outlined in its response to the family law inquiry the work we'll be doing this year and beyond to improve the operations of the child support system in our country. We are strongly committed to seeing single parents and the children they are raising receive the financial support they are entitled to. That's what this system should do. We are mindful of making sure that Services Australia and other government services don't inadvertently make financial abuse or other forms of abuse worse, and we're reviewing compliance, collection and enforcement. That is in no way a reflection on the people who do this work. It is difficult work, and they do it well. What we're looking at are the structures and rules that support them to do this work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This year the government will establish a child support consultation group, a group providing important input on issues being faced by parents and families, as well as a child support expert panel, which will consider the child support formula and whether it can more accurately represent the costs parents face today in raising kids. We will also support an evaluation of separated families to see what more should be done to support parents in situations where private collection arrangements have broken down, and we'll commission research looking at the costs facing separated parents. All of this will help us continue to reform this very important system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this bill there are, as I said, a number of significant changes. The first change in this bill is extending employer withholding, which is the default method of paying child support and is an effective way to collect support. Last financial year, employer withholding enabled the collection of $743 million in child support from 91,000 parents. The changes we're introducing in this bill will improve the active collection of child support debt in cases which have ended by extending the circumstances where Services Australia can deduct child support from a parent's wages. It will help to ensure that child support is paid on time, giving parents the financial resources they need to meet the week-to-week costs that come with raising their kids. Currently, employer withholding can only be initiated in active child support cases, cases where there is an ongoing obligation for child support. The bill before us fixes that. It enables Services Australia to use employer withholding to collect child support debts in any case, including those where the case has ended. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An example of this might be where a case has been active and then, of course, a child turns 18 and the case ends. That scenario sounds reasonable, but, in fact, it means that in some cases the receiving parent is still owed a debt by the other parent, but they can't take any action, because there isn't an active child support case. What we have here is a sensible proposition that, even if the case has ended, there's still the debt and it should be paid. We estimate this will recover up to $154 million owed in unpaid child support from a pool of around 18,000 parents. With an average debt of nearly $11,000 owing to the receiving parent we can see how this will make a big difference to families' lives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second change is tightening departure prohibition orders targeted at parents who deliberately and repeatedly avoid their child support obligations. Parents with a departure prohibition order will no longer be able to offer a refundable financial security like a bond to qualify for exemption, unless Services Australia is satisfied that they will make satisfactory arrangements to repay their child support debt within an appropriate period. This makes these rules clearer across families. It means if a parent returns to Australia they get that bond back, regardless of whether they repay the child support debt they're meant to. Under the current system, if the parent owing child support is someone of reasonably good financial means and can provide a bond, they can travel overseas while continuing to actively avoid their legal obligations to pay that child support, meaning that those children miss out. In this case, we are closing down a loophole that should be shut down. Parents who owe child support shouldn't be able to exploit a pathway like this to avoid paying up. The changes will enable Services Australia to refuse an exemption to allow overseas travel even if someone has a bond or other form of financial security to offer. On this measure, the data tells us there is a smaller number of families involved—about 110 parents are in this situation—but it's worth highlighting this small group of parents each have quite a substantial debt pool, averaging $43,500 each.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third change is on improving income accuracy for around 150,000 low-income parents. This will help prevent debts in circumstances where low-income parents on income support are not required to lodge a tax return. The change will allow Services Australia to deem the parent's adjustable taxable income to be equal to the self-support amount. We sometimes see at the moment inaccurate income estimates putting parents on lower incomes into a tough position financially—and these are people who are already in a tough position. It can result in a parent receiving less child support than they should or in fact being liable to pay more child support than they are able to. From 1 July this year, subject to the passage of this legislation, a parent who lodges a 'return not necessary' form and does not provide income information to Services Australia will have a provisional income created for them by Services Australia that is equal to their self-support amount, and that's the amount of money the parent receiving the child support needs to ensure they can get by with their own living expenses. This will be an important improvement on the current situation, where Services Australia may be applying a provisional income figure to the parent being assessed that is significantly higher than the actual figure. Again, we know this will make a real difference to families who rely on this system and who want it to be as accurate as possible. It will bolster our existing efforts to ensure that child support information is accurate, and it reflects the up-to-date earnings data of families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Child support is too important a system to leave as it is at the moment. As I've said, it is a system that, for many families, works in a reasonable way, and many families are satisfied with the measures and the way the system currently works for them. But there are certainly many families who have difficulties with this system, and we know that in many cases it is women who are suffering as a result of some of the problems that remain in the system. We know that there are opportunities for the system to be used to further financial abuse in relationships where there has been abuse. We know that sometimes the system is not operating as it should to give children the support they should have through life. For all those reasons, this is an important bill. It is an important first step in the commitments our government has made to make this a better system for Australian families, to understand how the system should work in their interest. We recognise the need to reform the system for the sake of parents and children. Parents and children deserve a system that is fit for purpose and effective. We know there is much more work to do, and I look forward to working with the minister, colleagues and other members of the parliament—to doing that work and to continuing to talk with members of my community, who, I know, have a personal interest in this and an understanding of some of the difficulties it can place people in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To all those people in my community—I have seen quite a few of them recently—I say: this bill is a statement of our faith as a government. We are intending to make this a system that works better for Australian families. This is the first step, and there is more to come.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:39</span>):  Labor has a proud history of improving the lives of Australian children and their families. It was a Labor government that introduced paid parental leave. It was a Labor government that launched the first National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. And it was a Labor government that legislated child support in 1988. Today we introduce the next stage of child support measures, to ensure that all children are given the financial support they deserve. Under the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Child Support Measures) Bill 2023, loopholes will be closed and more than $160 million of unpaid child support will be recovered and returned to single parents and their children who need it. What we know is that right now there are 18,000 parents who are not paying child support. This means, on average, that 18,000 children are missing out on $11,000 which they are each entitled to receive. This $11,000 could be for schoolbooks, new school shoes, the school excursion or to help put food on the table and pay the bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a former teacher in outer Melbourne and Geelong, I know just how challenging it can be for single parents and their children. Child support matters. I saw firsthand how teachers go above and beyond for their students by making sure they have eaten breakfast, have extra help with their homework and return home safely at the end of the day. I continue to hear the stories across my electorate of Corangamite. Breakfast clubs in schools like Leopold Primary School play such an important role in making sure children are looked after. But help like this can only go so far. It's time to fix a system that has not effectively enforced the payment of much-needed child support. This will be non-negotiable under this bill. The Albanese government is determined to help single parents raise their children to the best of their ability, without the anxiety that comes with financial stress. No parent should be forced to choose between paying for petrol for the school pick-up and paying the heating bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud that our government has always been at the forefront of this reform. Just yesterday, our government announced $1.9 billion over five years to extend parenting payments to those with children up to 14 years of age. Around 110,000 children will benefit from this scheme, with parents to take home more than $176 extra per fortnight through this Albanese government initiative. It's another milestone in Labor's history, which at its core is all about improving the lives of family and children. Such reforms remind me of the time when the Hawke government stepped in and introduced the groundbreaking child support scheme to ensure that children affected by family breakdown received adequate and fair financial security. The Albanese government is committed to continuing this work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite simply, the median income of parents who receive child support is not enough. It sits at around $33,000 annually, which is less than half of national average earnings. Our government recognises the financial stress facing many single-parent families, and that's why, in conjunction with this bill, we're introducing cheaper child care and a number of other measures in tonight's budget to help parents get back to work, earn more and pay their bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill supports reform and ensures that other parents contribute to child support cases. I know that most of these other parents try to do the right thing under the scheme. The data shows that over $33 billion in support payments have been made since the scheme's introduction in 1988. Despite this, child support debt is way too high. From 1 July, the bill will make it easier for Services Australia to collect child support debts, and it will help prevent further debts for low-income families by delivering three key changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, it will strengthen Services Australia's powers to collect debts from parents who have not paid their child support. To do this, the bill will expand the circumstances where debts can be deducted directly from a parent's wage. For example, when a child turns 18 and the case for child support has ended, Services Australia can retrieve any outstanding child support debt. At a time where financial stress is incredibly high for many young people, this reform will make sure they have the financial security to, say, move out of home or pursue a career.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, it will stop those parents—who are in the minority—who owe child support and exploit the loopholes of the scheme. One such loophole relates to travel bonds. Currently, by providing a bond, parents can get an exemption from payments if they go overseas. The problem is that, once they return, Services Australia can't keep that bond to contribute towards any unpaid support debts. This is not what the scheme is for, and it's not what we want for our nation's children and single-parent families. This bill will make sure that Services Australia can keep that bond and refuse an exemption for parents who have the means to pay support but choose not to. Not many parents cheat the system in this way, but those who do owe on average more than $43,000 each in child support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we are addressing the limitations of parental income assessments. Many parents who receive payments make less than $28,000 each year, which means they don't have to lodge a tax return. Without that critical information, Services Australia have to apply a default income assessment for the parent, which in many cases is a wild overestimation of their earnings. This means the guardian parent ends up in a position where they don't receive enough child support. On the flip side, it can also mean the other parent must pay more than they are able to afford. This bill addresses this problem for more than 150,000 parents. This reform will make sure children are better supported by ensuring that parental income assessments better reflect accurate earnings information: parents can advise Services Australia of their actual income at any time, and Services Australia can access information from the Australian Taxation Office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All in all, with this bill, we take the next step towards a better and fairer child support system. We know it will make a substantial difference to the lives of so many families in my electorate, who come to me and talk about this issue. We have listened and we, the Albanese government, are acting. We also recognise that there is more work to do when it comes to improving child support. That's why our government has committed to this bill and to implementing the recommendations of the report from the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Family Law System. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the Hawke government before us, our government wants to see child support paid in full and on time to make sure that parents have the financial resources they need to meet the costs of supporting a child on an everyday basis. We want to secure a better future for our nation's children; we want to take pressure off parents; we want to make sure we take the burden off teachers, friends and family; and, most importantly, we want this generation of children to look back on these years and know that they were looked after and given every opportunity to reach their potential.</span>
                </p>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:48</span>):  I wish to make a statement on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit concerning the draft budget estimates for the Australian National Audit Office and the Parliamentary Budget Office for 2023-24. Another year, another JCPAA budget statement. It was a big year last year; we got two budgets in. Of course, this statement has a cult following on budget eve, not least amongst the loyal, dedicated staff in the parliamentary liaison office, who are watching avidly. On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present this statement on the draft budget estimates of the Australian National Audit Office, the ANAO, and the Parliamentary Budget Office, the PBO.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee is required under the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951 and the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 to consider the draft budget estimates of the ANAO and the PBO and to make recommendations to both houses of parliament regarding these estimates. For context, the requirement to make a statement to the parliament in advance of the budget being handed down by a government is an important transparency measure. It assists the parliament and the public in making a judgement on the adequacy of the budget provided to the ANAO and the PBO through comparison with the requested funding—what those independent entities asked for—and the committee's recommendations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For this year's budget, both the ANAO and the PBO have sought additional funding. The committee has carefully scrutinised the ANAO's and PBO's draft budget estimates and has resolved to endorse them, subject to further review of the costings and final estimates which may be agreed with the Department of Finance. The committee considers both offices vital in supporting the work of this parliament and in strengthening integrity and transparency in public administration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ANAO are seeking an additional appropriation. In presenting its draft budget estimates to the committee, the ANAO noted that machinery-of-government changes following the 2022 federal election—in particular the creation of two new departments of state—will mean that additional costs have been incurred for mandatory financial statements and performance statement audits. Those audits have to be done to a particular standard, and there's little to no discretion, therefore, about the need to do them and to fund them. Further cost pressures have also arisen from the additional audit effort required to maintain compliance with audit standard ASA 315 to maintain adequate cybersecurity and data storage, as well as to meet the increased cost of external financial statement auditing capability where it is required to be purchased from the private sector, usually for highly specialist commercial stuff or in surge periods like the end of the financial year. The total funding request—subject to further refinement with the Department of Finance, as I said—is in the order of $14 million over the forward estimates. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee acknowledges that the government faces difficult fiscal circumstances in determining this year's budget and also acknowledges that the ANAO received supplementation in the 2021-22 budget, although that was predominantly for performance statement auditing, a new function, not to deal with these cost pressures. However, the committee considers that additional funding for the ANAO is critical to maintain mandatory standards in financial statement auditing, and without this additional funding the ANAO would be required—forced—to reduce its performance auditing budget. In the committee's view the government stands to save much more than it spends by meeting the ANAO's request, because a robust audit function is of critical value to any government, driving, as it does, efficiency and effectiveness throughout the public sector. In that context, the JCPAA endorses the ANAO's budget submission, subject to the ordinary parameter changes and any minor adjustments that may be agreed with the Department of Finance. In essence, the committee recommends that sufficient funding be provided to enable the ANAO to discharge its responsibilities, including rebuilding the performance audit program. That's the outcome we're trying to seek. The numbers always move around a bit, and we'll make judgements when we see what's in the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the PBO's estimated expenses for 2023-24 amount to $9.613 million, and it expects to meet the majority of its fiscal requirements from this appropriation. However, since its creation just over 10 years ago, the PBO has had a special appropriation fund designed to help it meet unexpected cost pressures. That fund, when established, was initially $6 million—it's its cash reserves, if you like—but has run down now to about $1.8 million over the last decade. The PBO is seeking to have the fund replenished to its original level in this year's budget. The committee regards the fund as an important element of the PBO's operational independence. It aligns with international standards, and these are really catchy. If you have a sleeping disorder, you could read the international standards for independent fiscal organisations or independent fiscal institutes, and you will find that fiscal independence through having sufficient cash reserves is a good thing to do. The committee regards this fund as an important element, as I said, of their operational independence and joins with the Presiding Officers to endorse the proposed appropriation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Auditor-General and the Parliamentary Budget Officer for their work in support of the parliament—they work for the parliament on behalf of the parliament—and for their cooperation in our detailed interrogation of their budget estimates. I also thank the JCPAA and committee members for their thoughtful and detailed consideration of these budget requests.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2023-2024 seeks approval for appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of approximately $28 billion, incorporating decisions from the 2023-24 budget. I now outline the most significant items provided for in this bill. The Department of Defence will receive nearly $12 billion, which will support the implementation of the government's response to the Defence Strategic Review, including major investments in military capabilities, as well as enabling ICT capabilities and infrastructure. The Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water will receive close to $9 billion, primarily for Rewiring the Nation to continue expanding and modernising Australia's electricity grids at lowest cost, unlocking new renewables and storage capacity and driving down power prices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts will receive approximately $4 billion, including funding for government business enterprises to continue to deliver projects, including the ARTC for the Inland Rail program, WSA Co for the Western Sydney international airport and NBN Co for the election commitment to boost fibre and fast-track the NBN repair job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Appropriation Bill (No. 2) also contains an Advance to the Finance Minister provision of $600 million to provide the government with the capacity to allocate additional appropriations for urgent and unforeseen expenditure. Since March 2020, the AFM provisions in annual appropriations acts have been set at an extraordinary level, primarily due to the unique and evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2023-24 bills return the AFM provisions to conventional levels, as the Australian governments have agreed to a strategic framework to support the transition of measures and policies to a sustainable COVID-19 steady state. These measures should reduce the potential call on AFM provisions in the future, and a specific AFM provision for COVID-19 or other national emergency response is no longer required. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also sets the debit limits for payments under the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 that apply in 2023-24. They are as follows: $5 billion for general purpose financial assistance and $35 billion for national partnership payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Full details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the schedules to the bill, the explanatory memorandum and the portfolio budget statements tabled in the parliament today. I commend the bill to this chamber.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the government introduces the 2022-23 additional estimates appropriation bills. These bills are the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2022-23, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2022-23 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2022-23. These bills underpin the government's expenditure decisions made since the October 2022 budget that relate to the 2022-23 financial year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) seeks approval for appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of $5.5 billion. This would ensure that there is sufficient appropriation to cover estimate variations related to existing programs—for instance, changes to costs for demand driven programs. These bills also pave for the first-year costs for measures announced since the October 2022 budget. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill provides funding to support the following significant items. The Department of Defence will receive $1.8 billion. This primarily reflects the reclassification of $1.3 billion from capital to operating funding, reflecting updated expenditure requirements and supplementation of $172.3 million for foreign exchange losses incurred during 2021-22. The Social Services portfolio will receive over $1 billion, with the majority of funding provided for the National Disability Insurance Agency to provide reasonable and necessary supports for National Disability Insurance Scheme participants. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations will receive just under $1 billion, primarily to support apprentices and employers through the boosting apprenticeship commencements wage subsidy. The Department of Health and Aged Care will receive close to $900 million, including $207 million for vaccines and logistics, $182 million to reimburse aged-care providers, a direct cost relating to managing the COVID-19 outbreaks, and $166 million for administration of the COVID-19 vaccine. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will receive over $235 million to meet the surge in demand for passports following the reopening of international borders and for the design and construction of the Australian pavilion at the Osaka World Expo.</span>

The Attorney-General's portfolio will receive over $10 million with approximately $7 million for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to support the development of a new case management system for a new federal administrative review body. The Department of Health and Aged Care will receive approximately $10 million, including $7 million to manage the COVID-19 vaccine data.
