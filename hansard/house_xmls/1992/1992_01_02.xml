        Let me just make an initial observation, if I might. You have a wonderfully vigorous political climate. That has got to be the classic understatement of the year. I see the rough and tumble that goes forth, and I thank God for the presidential system at home. Let me make this observation, though: I feel very fortunate to have known several of your members from both sides of the aisle over the years. And amidst all the intensity and emotion brought forth in these chambers, I have always been impressed by the united message that your leaders have sent to my country. Even when out of office or in opposition, they have always placed Australia's interests ahead of personal interests—and that says something very positive, very important, about your great country.

        I am sure it comes as no surprise that my highest priority as President of the United States is to promote economic growth and jobs for our people. That goal is fully consistent with economic growth and jobs for Australians. You and I know that open markets generate growth; that international trade is not simply a zero-sum game. You also know that the nations which share the rewards of a vibrant and growing international trading system must also share the responsibilities.

        Australia has stood as a true leader in efforts to achieve success in the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations. You brought great skill and energy in seeking deep cuts in trade distorting agricultural subsidies. Progress on agriculture is the key to the success of the GATT talks. Your farmers are not alone in feeling the pain caused by the heavy subsidies of the European Community—our wheat production dropped by almost 30 per cent last year. But I am also aware of the concern such United States trade programs as the export enhancement program can cause Australian farmers.

        Our EEP has one and only one objective; that is, to force the EC to stop its avalanche of subsidised exports. The fact is that the EC subsidises over 10 times the amount of farm exports that we do. Moreover, our program seeks to minimise the effects on Australia and other non-subsidising nations. While I do not like having to use these remedies, I will safeguard the interests of American farmers. Without EEP, the European Community would absorb additional markets, forcing out those who can compete fairly—farmers in countries like Australia and the United States.

        We both know, all of us know, that the real answer is what our two governments are doing—working hard for an historic new GATT arrangement that cuts back subsidies, especially for exports. That is why the United States is committed to working with GATT Director Dunkel's new text. We believe his draft moves us closer to finally concluding an agreement. While not perfect, it makes an important contribution and the international trading system is too important to pass up this opportunity.

        We also see the potential for using regional organisations to expand and, indeed, liberalise trade around the globe. We are especially encouraged by Australia's leadership in the APEC—the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation—process. The success of the November APEC ministerial in Seoul was proof that APEC is emerging as the economic forum in the Pacific and is increasingly fostering a sense of community around the Pacific rim. North America—Mexico, the United States and Canada—is part of this community. So let me just assure you—every one of you, both sides of this aisle—that the North America Free Trade Agreement will not become an exclusive trading bloc. It will lower internal barriers without raising external barriers and our growth will help stimulate yours, just as growth in Asia will spur our exports.

I foresee a steady expansion of travel and cultural exchanges in years to come. Australia's natural beauty, of which I have seen regrettably little this trip, is really sensational, a powerful magnet for American tourists.

Your artists' contributions to film and dance and music have whetted our appetites for more and more things Australian.
