         â€”In addressing the question of the budget, can I say that, while it might take
         <break page="4116" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          some time for people to realise it, this budget marks the end of an eraâ€”and a very important era. It marks the end of an era in which Australian governments have tried to achieve full employment for their citizens: the concept of all Australians being entitled to a job and to a real job opportunity.
         </break>
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The clearest indicator of this is the decision in the budget to abolish the Commonwealth Employment Service. The CES was set up in 1946, exactly half a century ago. It was an integral part of the postwar consensus shaped by the Labor Party and which has survived up until now to strive for full employment. So important was the idea of a Commonwealth Employment Service, of a free employment exchange, in the project of postwar reconstruction that it was enshrined in an international convention. In 1949, member nations of the ILO, following the declaration of Philadelphia that established the ILO and set up in bright lights the question of full employment as an objective for all nations, resolved to phase out fee&amp;hyphen;charging employment agencies. They did this so that all nations would maintain or ensure the maintenance of a free employment service.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This was to be an employment service available to all workers. The concept of one nation was for all Australians to have access to a free employment service irrespective of where you livedâ€”be it metropolitan Australia or country and regional Australia. It is interesting to note that, following the establishment of the Commonwealth Employment Service in 1946, a network of Commonwealth Employment Service offices all around Australia was established as a result of that decision, the decision of this parliament. It was important because this was to be an employment service available to all workersâ€”not just those who could pass a mean&amp;hyphen;spirited government's `capacity to benefit' test, as is the Howard government's approach of today.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other components of that great postwar consensus included the 1944 White Paper on Full Employment and a bold program of public works such as the Snowy Mountains schemeâ€”a scheme which I think we all believe was of the utmost importance to the future of Australia. That scheme also, as part
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         of postwar reconstruction, gave the opportunity to many people to come to Australia from a range of countries around the world and to contribute to the development of this great nation. These creations came about because of the vision of people like Ben Chifley, the then Labor Prime Minister.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is interesting to note that the then opposition supported the establishment of the Commonwealth Employment Service. The reason the then Labor government brought these schemes in and supported not only decent national infrastructure projects but also the Commonwealth Employment Service was that people who had experienced the scourge of mass unemployment in the Depression of the 1930s decided that they had an obligation to ensure that it would never be repeated.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The people who benefited were people like my own father, who was given the opportunity for trade training and work as a bricklayer by the policies of putting jobs first pursued by the postwar Labor government. It is interesting to note that those very people were offered a six-month training course not dissimilar to those opportunities provided under Working Nation. The objective was to ensure that, having been given access to some basic training and to the opportunity of getting some basic skills, they were then given the very experience in industry which would ensure that they were not only job ready but also capable of accessing ongoing, meaningful employment. A generation of Australians was appreciative of the programs pursued by the likes of Ben Chifley, just as I say that a generation of Australians would have benefited by the current government pursuing the type of Working Nation initiatives put in place by the previous government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        All governments, Labor and Liberal, to varying degrees have stuck to the goal of full employment since that time. Social changes and changes in the world economy, particularly since 1973, have naturally made that goal much harder to attain than in the long years of postwar post economic boom. The goal itself, I am pleased to say, has always been upheld until now. But not nowâ€”no, not any moreâ€”not after the first Howard budget.

         This budget marks the first time since the Second World War that a new government has failed to even try to reduce unemployment in its first budget. That is what it has failed to do: it has failed to even suggest that its primary objective at the momentâ€”in its first budget, in its first term of governmentâ€”is to reduce unemployment. This budget is the first time since the Great Depression of the 1930s that an Australian government has wilfully ignored the curse of unemployment and, more importantly, deliberately withdrawn services from those disadvantaged people in many areas of Australia, especially in regional Australia.

         The Howard government has effectively, through the budget, thrown the towel in and stated publicly that unemployment is now no longer a priority. What a disgrace to think that in 1996 the number one challenge confronting Australiaâ€”the question of reducing unemploymentâ€”is not a priority in the Howard government's agenda.

        <para first-indent="16">
         There are many challenges confronting Australia. If you go out into mainstream Australia, into the suburbs and the regions of Australia, all they want to talk about at the moment is the ongoing responsibility of both sides of the Australian parliament to put their heads together and do something about the question of unemployment because those people do not want to see a generation lost without opportunity and without a capacity to pursue a meaningful opportunity in life. That is why I say that, without a doubt, the Howard governmentâ€”and, yes, they ought to hang their heads in shameâ€”have thrown the towel in and stated publicly that unemployment is not a priority.

         The Commonwealth Employment Service is staffedâ€”and I am pleased to say thisâ€”by thousands of dedicated men and women around Australia. Unlike some on the other side of the House would suggest, those men and women who staff the CES take on the difficult task day in and day out of matching job seekers with available job vacancies. To their credit they help steer the long-term unemployed into suitable case management, training and support.

          I recently had an opportunity to speak to some of those dedicated people at Casuarina CES in the Northern Territory.

          The real problem is that they question whether or not the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) was prepared to stand up and fight for a network of CES offices throughout the Northern Territory rather than throw the towel in, just as he threw it in with respect to the Office of Northern Development when this government said that it was no longer a priority for the Howard government to assist with regional development in Australia. Just as he was not prepared to stand up for the Office of Northern Development, he is not prepared to stand up for a network of CES offices throughout the Northern Territory.

          The local CES is part of our community around Australia. It is a vital part of our sadly fraying community infrastructure. It is an integral part of the balanced set of approaches we started under Working Nation to improve service delivery. If it goes, it will be sorely missed by thousands upon thousands of Australians. It will weaken the very delivery of the active labour market program support that we introduced in government.

           High fees, I suggest, will be charged by the new competing employment placing enterprisesâ€”the so-called EPEsâ€”in most cases, enabling significant profits to be made by those favoured in the process.

It will be a one-stop shop for the long-term unemployedâ€”no services, no opportunity in life and condemned to benefits for the rest of their lives, be it in seats such as Lowe, the Northern Territory, Capricornia or Leichhardt.

           Let me make it clear. There is nothing wrong in principle with combining the resources of the current social security offices with the resources of the CES offices. This is a direction in which the previous Labor government was moving. Its objective was to make it simpler for unemployed people to obtain both jobsearch assistance and benefit payments at one location. But that is not what is going to happen now. Mark my words, what is going to happen now is entirely different from what was a fair and practical objective with respect to the establishment of a one-stop shop.

           There are plans afoot to have a massive 5,000 fewer staff in the new network of offices than in the old. Yes, another 5,000 jobs going and you can imagine the impact that is going to have on regional Australia in places such as Launceston, where we have already seen the closure of the local CES office; Newcastle, where we have already seen the closure of the Belmont office; Cairns, where we have already seen the closure of the Mareeba CES office since the election; Mowbray; North Melbourne; South Melbourne; and Granville in western Sydney.

           These are places that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) might be naturally concerned with in respect of unemployment; places where those citizens of Australia depend on the CES office, respect it and support the dedicated staff who go out of their way to assist them. I suggest that the Prime Minister go and ask the people in these suburbs and towns what they think about losing their CES and its associated jobs.

           The abolition of the CES represents a huge reduction in service for job seekers. The one-stop shop is just a public relations gloss to divert attention from this violent crime, this violent change which is to be inflicted on the jobless. There is no advantage in having a one-stop shop if there are only half as many shops and if the queues there are twice as long. There is even less advantage if the office's doors are permanently closed to many thousands of job seekers whom the government cannot even be bothered to help.

           These cuts in employment assistance are taking place at John Howard's personal insistenceâ€”mark it: at John Howard's personal insistence. I wonder whether John Howard has any idea of how badly the morale and commitment of CES offices has been hit by his decision to destroy their service. When people see and feel the difference in their lives that the absence of a CES makes, we are going to remind them endlessly of who took it awayâ€”the Howard coalition government.

That in turn will impact on mainstream Australiaâ€”the mainstream Australia that the Prime Minister likes to wrap himself around.

           The surveys of employment vacancies since this government was elected show that vacancies have already slumped to their lowest level in years. The burst of confidence normally associated with a new government is glaringly absent. Little wonder, given that in the six months since this government took office it has moved to axe some 30,000 jobs in the public sector, up to another 30,000 in Telstra and countless more in higher education. Now, with this no jobs budgetâ€”that is what it isâ€”another $8 billion is to be taken out of the economy over the next two years.

            I support Labor's amendments to the second reading motion. Labor will never give up striving for full employment as this government has given up. We will revive this great ideal. We will devise the means to attain it just as the Australian people expect their governments to do. The issue of the day is unemployment. I contend that it is about time that the new government lived up to its responsibilities. It should set a jobs target because anyone who wants to achieve anything in life should be prepared to set targets.

         â€”I rise to join this debate on the Appropriation Bill, but before I go into the main part of what I wish to say, I would like to make passing reference to some matters raised by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson). He did raise some interesting points. In his almost 20&amp;hyphen;minute address, he spent nearly all of his time
         <break page="4121" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          talking about two specific matters: unemployment and the CES. He said that the Howard government is sensitive about the issue of unemployment.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is no doubt that the Howard coalition government is very sensitive about the issue of unemployment. One of the reasons we were elected with such an overwhelming majority is that people were telling us that they were feeling sensitive about the issue of unemployment. It is an indictment on Laborâ€”a party that purports to stand for working class Australiaâ€”that, after 13 years in government, there are one million Australians who are unemployed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The honourable member for Batman mentioned the scourge of mass unemployment, and that is absolutely right. After 13 years, we do have a scourge of unemployment. He said that everywhere he goes in Australia, he is told by average Australians that the government and the opposition should put their heads together to reduce unemployment. I think that is absolutely right. The people I speak to are saying to me, `Why doesn't the Labor Party join the government in attacking the question of unemployment, in doing something specific and something concrete about unemployment?'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The feigned concern that the Labor Party have for the unemployed was brought home to me when, at the request of former New South Wales Premier Greiner, I represented New South Wales at a meeting of state treasurers here in Canberra. The then Prime Minister of Australia, Bob Hawke, was sitting only a couple of seats away from me in the cabinet room. He asked the Treasury officials, `What is the situation regarding the LTUs?' I had never heard of such a phrase. I felt a bit uneasy because I thought that if I were to ask the New South Wales Treasury officials what LTUs were, they might tell me that I should know what they were. I did not know, so I thought I had better find out. I turned to the Treasury officials and asked, `What are the LTUs that the Prime Minister is referring to?' They replied, `Long-term unemployed.' For a Labor Prime Minister of Australia to refer to the one million Australiansâ€”half a million of whom are long-term unemployedâ€”by
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         using the acronym LTU is indicative that those opposite have lost their commitment to the people who are unemployed.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other matter that was raised by the member for Batman was the question of the CES. He kept saying repeatedly that the new government is going to abolish the CES. I put it to the honourable member for Batman that there is a very big difference between abolishing and re-organising.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The CES is well intentioned, but it has not delivered. With one million Australians out of work and with no hope for a reduction in long-term unemployment, the CES has to adopt a different attitude and a different way of doing things. As I have said, there is no doubt that the staff of the CES are committed. They all work hard and no-one should decry their involvement and their commitment. However, it has not been working and something must be done. There is no doubt that the CES will find that, once they get re-organised and they merge with the Department of Social Security in a one-stop shop, costs will come down and a better service will be provided.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I turn now to the budget. If there is anything that defined the attitude of the previous Keating Labor government to budgets it is deficit and debt. When we came into government we found that the underlying deficit for 1995 was $10.3 billion. We face a starting point deficit for 1996-97 of $9.6 billion. The emphasis in this budget is on reducing the deficit. In my opinion, the best outcome is a return of confidence in the economy. There will be a $3.9 billion reduction in the deficit this year and a further $3.3 billion reduction in the deficit next yearâ€”that is, a reduction in the deficit of $7.2 billion.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What was scandalous with regard to the attitude of the former government was its own purpose spending. During the  past five years, own purpose spending for the federal Labor government grew by an astounding 45 per cent. I have rarely seen growth to that extent and the former Labor government should be ashamed of itself for allowing its own purpose spending to grow by 45 per cent in a three&amp;hyphen;year period.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Despite all the tough but fair and responsible financial measures taken by the Howard
        <break page="4122" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         government to reduce spending, we still face a deficit of $5.6 billion in 1996-97 and a deficit of $1.5 billion the year after. If the Keating government had been re-elected, there is no doubt that Australia's credit rating would have been further eroded with all the consequential results.

        It is very interesting to note that in the mid&amp;hyphen;1980s Australia enjoyed a AAA credit rating. In the mid&amp;hyphen;1980s, after only a few years of Labor government, Moody's decided to downgrade Australia's credit rating from AAA to AA1 and at the same time Standard and Poor's downgraded Australia's credit rating to AA plus. In 1989, for the second time, Standard and Poor's downgraded Australia's credit rating from AA plus down to AA. In 1989, Moody's reduced Australia's credit rating from AA1 to AA2.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This means a great deal on the international economic front. There is no doubt that a risk premium is added to Australia's borrowings with any downgrading of our credit rating. The result of the addition of a risk premium means that Australians have to pay more to borrow money. That is an impost on Australia and Australiansâ€”an impost that has to be paid. As a result, the cost of living goes up, the cost of borrowing goes up and the cost of running businesses goes up.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is very interesting to note that, as a result of this budget, Standard and Poor's has announced only very recently that Australia could, after 13 years, have its credit rating upgraded. That is a very positive thing for Australia and all Australians.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I turn now to the question of promises kept. First of all, I want to refer to self&amp;hyphen;funded retirees. The tax rebate for all self&amp;hyphen;funded retirees, costing up to $80 million, has been instituted. Child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebates costing in the vicinity of $120 million per year have been retained more or less in general terms. The subsidy for private health insurance has been delivered at $450.

       <para first-indent="16">
        This is a tough but fair budget which shares the burden. That is another way to describe itâ€”tough but fair. There is to be a higher Medicare levy for high income earnersâ€”something the former government did not

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other matter I believe is very important and needs to be addressed in this parliament is that of rich tax avoiders. It is very interesting that the former Labor government waited until three weeks, or maybe even two weeks, before the election to say that, if they are returned, they will address the issue of rich tax avoiders. Why did they wait for 13 years to say something about this rort, which is costing the average Australian a lot of money? This situation is unnecessary and should have been tackled. I was very glad to see that rich tax avoiders will have to pay a fair amount of money to consolidated revenue. It is expected that some $100 million will be collected. Labor failed to act, and the Howard government has now addressed this very important issue.

        In regard to the Beazley black hole, the $8 billion, the August 1995 budget papers showed Treasury's forward estimates of government spending and revenue. They indicated to us that that would be in the vicinity of $2 billion or $3 billion. In February 1996, just prior to the election, Treasury made available to the government the estimates, which were secreted away by a drowning Keating Labor government and not shown to the coalition until after the election win. They showed the forward estimates for 1995â€”that is, for the 1996-97 year, with outlays at $135 billion and income at $134 billion. This was the situation prior to the information being made available.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Upon coming to government, we found an increase in outlays of $2 billion, bringing that up to $137 billionâ€”this information was not passed on to the Howard&amp;hyphen;Fischer coalitionâ€”and that income was reduced by $4 billion. So there was $137 billion in outlays and $129 billion in income. We should have known about all this prior to the election. In all honesty the former government should have made that information available, but they chose not to and are now screaming when we talk about the Beazley black hole. No wonder they are screaming. They are saying we should have known. How could we have known when they had that information and
        <break page="4123" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         kept it from the opposition? This will not happen again.

        The Costello budget is deflationary. Last yearâ€”that is, 1995-96â€”spending grew at 3.9 per cent, which is reasonable. This year there will be a zero growth rate as a result of the Keating government's policies. Following the forward estimates coming into effect, the growth rate this year is zero, and that is an indictment of the former government.

        This budget has an emphasis on small business. The labour market programs, which the honourable member for Batman referred to at great length, have cost the Australian taxpayer billions of dollars and have failed miserably. The former government threw money at all these problems with no long-term planning and put people into a job for a while and then threw them out of it when the money ran out. Look at all the programs the former government put in place: One Nation, Investing in the Nation, Working Nation, Creative Nationâ€”and so the list goes on.

        The Australian public, the Australian electorate, were very patient with the former government. They gave the former government a good go and they just did not deliver. The most effective way any government can genuinely assist the unemployed is by getting the economy right. Governments borrowing money to provide short-term jobs are only putting the inevitable off as they will ultimately have to face up to the fact that borrowings have to be repaid and the losers are again the unemployed, especially the long-term unemployed. A healthy small business sector is the quickest and only way to take up employment. This budget, within present constraints, goes a long way towards achieving that goalâ€”for example, by providing relief in relation to capital gains tax.

        I want to refer to jobs growth, because the honourable member for Batman spent all of his 20&amp;hyphen;minute contribution on jobs and I think it is vitally important we set the record straight. At the beginning of the year, jobs growth was about three per cent. We need five per cent jobs growth to bring unemployment down to a reasonable levelâ€”if any unemployment is reasonable. More recently, because of the former government's policies,
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         jobs growth has dwindled to about one per cent. So how can the honourable member for Batman or the opposition say that they should not have been kicked out of government when the growth rate has been reduced to the vicinity of one per cent? Very large numbers of Australians will have no future unless jobs growth is increased substantially.

        I know some commentators have said that a reduction in spending and the tightening of fiscal measures will mean an even slower jobs growth. However, that assertion has to be seen in the context of the $4 billion reduction in spending in 1996-97 compared with Australia's GDP, which is in the vicinity of $460 billion. That is a one per cent reduction. As I mentioned previously, the renewed confidence in small and medium business will bring about the uplift of the economy. This budget provides the necessary framework and, in conjunction with industrial relations changesâ€”especially the changes to the unfair dismissal laws to make them fair dismissal laws by protecting the rights of employers and the employeesâ€”will go a long way towards that.

        Lo and behold: what have we seen after the promises that have been made by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, and the coalition to maintain Labor's commitments to national highway funding, to maintain Labor's commitments to payments to the states and local government with respect to roads and, in addition, to spend $65 million per year over 10 years on the Pacific Highway and $36 million a year over four years on the black spots program?

But where the big cut occurs and where the big damage occurs is in the national highway program. Six hundred and twenty-two million dollars over four years is to be taken out of the national highway program. Even if you ignore the promise to make the new commitments to the Pacific Highway and black spots additional to existing commitments and factor in the amounts there, you still end up with funding that is more than $50 million per year over the four yearsâ€”over $200 million over the four yearsâ€”less than what the former Labor government was going to commit.

Not only is he presiding over the abolition of regional development but the cost of redundancies in his department as a result of that decision is going to be taken out of the transport department's own administration budget.

Regional development has been slashed.

It is pretty obvious that the Treasurer understands the real impact of what he is doingâ€”that is, that the contractionary impact will be such that growth will reduce, we will go into or close to recession and he will have to inflate the budget and he will have to increase outlays in a couple of years time to correct the damage.

It has betrayed workers, it has betrayed battlers and it has condemned Australians to fewer jobs, lower growth, lower exports. It has done very little in the transport area, as much as anywhere else. It has done very little to tackle the real problems in Australian industry, to tackle the real problems of unemployment, industry development and productivity. This government thinks the response to the budget is good, but bit by bit it is going to find that the politics of this budget will unravel as people start to experience the specific aspects of the budget and start to realise what it means for them and their living standards.

        â€”My remarks certainly are going to obstruction of the business of the House. On that point, let me say that there is provision in the standing orders to move motions and to call divisions. If they are to be considered disruptive, it occurs to me that there would be many occasions in this House where divisions are called without any hope of them succeeding and so could be interpreted as obstructive. Of course, that is plainly not the intention of standing orders.

      <para first-indent="16">
       So the situation we are in which leads the chair to believe we might be disruptive or in some way impeding the normal course of business of the House arises out of a failure of the standing orders to deal with the presence of Independent members. All the speaking arrangements are predicated, it seems to me, on the issue of a speakers list. That list is merely issued for the guidance of the chair, as I am sure you are aware, Madam Deputy Speaker. It has no standing in the standing orders. It is not mentioned; nor should it be.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       In fact, in other parliaments, including the state parliament in Western Australia, there is no such thing as a speakers list. People rise, in accordance with what is provided similarly in our standing orders, to seek the call of the person in the chair at the time. So this House is peculiar in that speakers lists are issued,
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        they are arranged by government and opposition whips, but they have no standing or credibility in the sense that they are relevant to any standing order whereas the motion I moved does.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       It is under these circumstances that I, as do others amongst my Independent colleagues, find myself in the position where we cannot get, on any reasonable basis, on to a speakers list which the chair uses for its guidance only. So we have this really outrageous situation where up to five elected members in this chamber cannot in any formal way obtain the call of the chair if the chair adheres rigidly to the speakers list, which has no standing or force under standing orders.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I submit that on each of the four or five occasions I have tried to speak under these circumstances I was the first on my feet. I know it is difficult, if there is someone on the other side to me, for the chair to necessarily notice me in the first place, but I suspect that that is not the case on every occasion. Knowing the problem that I was confronted with, you can rest assured that I was first out of the blocks on every occasion, including this morning. The chair might not necessarily have been able to see that, particularly if it was being guided by this speakers list, which has no standing, and was looking in the direction of the member whose name appears next to speak on the list.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       We have the situation now, Madam Deputy Speaker, where the advice I obtained and was given is not to be applied on some motion that a member who rises to be heard before or at the start of the speaking time of another member is being disruptive. In itself, that cannot be disruptive, I put to you, because it is open to anyone to get up and to move that motion. I chose particularly the occasions when the previous speaker had finished to take the opportunity to seek the call in the way that I did. That is not disruptive.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I submit to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that it cannot be disruptive then to call for a division on the motion. It is clearly provided for and anticipated in standing orders, but it is inherent in everything we do in this place that, if we disagree and if it is within the rules that apply to debate in this chamber, we
       <break page="4131" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        follow that course. It is as simple as that. That cannot be disruptive. In any legalistic sense it cannot be disruptive.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       So I find myself in the very awkward position of having to dissent from your ruling, Madam Deputy Speaker. I believe it is quite unnecessaryâ€”in fact, I believe the circumstances that have led to this are quite unnecessary. If the Speaker had chosen, at an appropriate time when this parliament first sat, to react to the enjoiners of some of my Independent colleagues and me, a formula would have been created where we got our opportunities in accordance perhaps with the relative numbers. That is what applies in the granting of questions without notice to Independent members. It happens with allocation of speaking time on various private members debates such as the grievance debate. In fact, it is quite a normal arrangement.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       If you went to the extreme, Madam Deputy Speaker, and said that, by taking my full speaking time in addressing this motion, it was disruptive, we would have another set of circumstances. Yet standing orders provide for what I did in moving that I be now heard and in what I am doing now. There is no basic difference. I have acted in accordance with the standing orders. Clearly, standing order 61 has not been breached, nor indeed have you suggested that it has.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       By any stretch of the imagination, it cannot be considered obstructionist or disruptive to exercise a right clearly given to a member. If that right, as is the House's equal right to disagree, shapes up in the form of a division, that is how it goes. But it is not disruptive; it is not obstructionist; it is acting in accordance with a set of rules by which we are all required to abide. I will not run the risk of being further disruptive or obstructionist in the eyes of the chair because I do not intend to take my full speaking time.

Madam Deputy Speaker, we appreciate the consideration that you have provided those dissentients in as much as you have allowed for them to have an opportunity to be heard on this issue, although, as you say, technically once you have formed an opinion then under this standing order that is the end of the matter. It is not technically by way of indulgence that you do so, but you have facilitated their being heard.

      <para first-indent="16">
       In terms of the expression of opinion which you have articulated, the government supports the thrust of your ruling. We do so for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is quite clear that you are able to so act because standing order 86 specifically includes reference to:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Question that a Member "be now heard" or "do now speak".
      </para>
      <para>
       So there is no question that the words of the motion that a member `be now heard' may be the subject of the words at the end of standing order 86, which allows you to come to the opinion that the motion in itself is an abuse of the processes of the House. That is the first point. It was argued the other way by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) but, on any fair interpretation of this standing order, it specifically includes those procedural motions where a member is moving that they be now heard. You are therefore entitled to form the opinion that you have.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The second question is whether or not the evidence would be before the chair to allow you to form that opinion. I think that is also quite clear. The facts are really revealed in the speech of the member for Curtin. Before referring to his remarks a moment ago expressed, the chair would be aware, as an active member of the House, that this is not an isolated occasion. In fact, the member has attempted such motionsâ€”

        The situation is that there has been a pattern of events from the member for Curtin, all of which are symbolic of his concerns about the rights of Independents and their speaking opportunities. The processes in the past, the conventions in the chamber, have been that the Chief Opposition Whip receives from all non-government members an expression that they wish to be on the speakers list. That is how the system works. It is quite simple. Every day someone drafts up a list of who is going to speak. In respect of the non-government membersâ€”

        Madam Deputy Speaker, in making your ruling that the member for Curtin was being disruptive under the provisions of standing order 86, in essence you have provided a greater opportunity for executive government to prevent the voice of the people being expressed in this chamber. In essence, you have contributed to the overweening, overbalanced power of the executive vis&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;vis the parliament. We all know that, because of the tyranny of numbers in this place, in essence the executive runs this chamber. It runs it mercilessly, as it did under the previous government.

We all sat here and said that we would wait and see what happens, that we would wait and make our judgments based on our experience. Six months have passed and I cannot see any difference between this administration's conduct of the business of this House and the previous one's.

       The argument that is put is quite right; that is, if the House wants not to have a list, it should have the right to that expression. But you saw from the vote earlier that the great majority of the House wanted to go on a list. Why do they want to go on a list? It is because there are 148 members of the House and they each want their proportionate turn in which to speak.

While there probably are some points in the matters raised by the member for Moore (Mr Filing), I think your ruling was a reasonable one. Members of the House had made a decision, about 40 minutes prior to the Independents disputing your ruling, that they wished to, in effect, stay with the speakers list which the House had before it. Standing order 86 is fairly clear. It provides that a number of matters have to be put

       As the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) injected my name into this debate earlier, I point out to the House that the opposition is more than willing to produce a speakers list which includes all shades of opinion for the non-government members in this House.

The member for Oxley and the member for Calare have been able to speak. The member for Kalgoorlie regularly gets to speak. I say to the member for Moore: let's try this system that has been proposed. It worked in the last parliament for Mr Mack and Mr Cleary, and I am sure it will work in this parliament for the five Independents.

         â€”It has been good to have the opposition members voting on the same side as the government on the last two divisions. I hope they have got used to the idea and use their vote constructively to also support the 1996 budget. This is an important budget for Australia. It represents a turning point in the financial history of our country. At long last a government has taken our budget deficit seriously and has put in place a program to eliminate that deficit over the years ahead.

        The most widely acclaimed feature of the 1996 federal budget has been its financial responsibility. The budget clearly indicated, for the first time in more than a decade, that a federal government was serious about living within its means. The first Howard government budget included a firm strategy to eliminate the budget deficit over the next three years and to start paying off some of the legacy of debt bequeathed by the former Labor regime.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In an answer to a question without notice this week from me, the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) confirmed that the federal government's debt is now over $96 billion and, without radical changes in policy, would have reached $120 billion by the year 2000. The federal government's debt will have risen by 600 per cent in just 10 years, including a $69 billion increase in the last five years. Labor has left this nation an appalling legacy of debt.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Fahey told the parliament that the $10 billion included in this budget to pay interest on Labor's debt is equivalent to half the entire health budget and all the education budget. To put it in other language: every man, woman and child in Australia will be paying around $5,000 extra in taxes every year to pay off the legacy of 13 years of ALP government.

It is interesting to note, if we trace the history of our country since Federation, that Labor governments have been in office for less than a third of the 95&amp;hyphen;year history of our country but they have been responsible for accumulating over 90 per cent of the government's foreign debt.

        They have always adopted this attitude that they can spend as if there were no tomorrow and that the bankcard will never be called up. It might be pleasant in government to be going out spending money, favouring all of the groups that have supported the government parties during election times; it may be popular to give your electorate the extra goodies they so often want to receive. It is popular to raise social security benefits and to spend more on government programs, to raise Public Service salaries, to build new buildings and to ensure that the processes of government are well heeled.

       <para first-indent="16">
        That may well be popular but it all has to be paid for. The bills come in. The interesting thing about our current economic crisis as a nation is that it has arisen because never before in history have we had such an extended period of Labor government. Normally, we have had three or four years of Labor spending sprees, then they were turfed out of office and a government with better management skills has been able to come along and balance the budget before our nation's debt gets out of control.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But this time we have had more than a decade of uninterrupted Labor rule, more than a decade of uninterrupted mismanagement. So these debts have really accumulated. The government debt is now $96 billion and the interest on that debt is one of the major items of our expenditure. Indeed, the $10.3 billion budget deficit that this government confronted on coming to office would not really have existed if we did not have to pay interest and redemption on the debts of the previous regime.

         in government have got to be put on hold as we pay the bills of a previous era. Balanced federal budgets are essential to keep down interest rates and to boost investment. Already, market confidence in the government's budget strategy has produced an interest rate dropâ€”and more are possible. The half a per cent reduction in interest rates means something like $70 a month on the average household mortgage loan. Those are very real benefits that can be built upon by continuing to balance the budget and for our Commonwealth to be seen as financially responsible.

        I was impressed by the comments of Standard and Poor's, which are looking again at the possibility of upgrading Australia's credit rating. Our credit rating was reduced three times under the Labor regimeâ€”at considerable cost to all borrowers in this nation. At last the international credit rating agencies are starting to look favourably upon our country. It is important, therefore, that the strategy of this budget be carried through and that the program to balance the budget be honoured, maintained and delivered.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Unfortunately, it is clear that Labor have learned nothing from their federal election defeat. Their declared intention to oppose $7 billion of budget deficit reduction measures would, if successful, destroy the prospects for restoring Australia's credit rating and destroy the prospects for continuing lower interest charges. If the government is unable to deliver on its budget deficit strategy, the repercussions for our country will be continuing high interest rates, a continuing lack of confidence in our nation's financial capability and a continual lowering of our international credit rating. It is essential that the strategy of the budget be honoured. I call upon the Labor opposition to demonstrate how important it is to maintain fiscal responsibility by supporting the key elements of our budget strategy.

        The Democrats, of course, are even worse. They propose even more wholesale hacking away at the strategy of the budget and propose even greater levels of expenditure. The Democrats are becoming something of an enigma. They promised at the election to keep the parties honest. But now they are seemingly opposing every attempt by the government
        <break page="4141" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         to implement its election promises. When we seek to honour our promises they vote against it. How is that keeping the major parties honest? The Democrats need to look thoroughly at their level of honesty, they need to look thoroughly at the way they portray themselves and they need to be responsible. They are elected as senators by a small percentage of the people of Australia. They have a role and they must use that role constructively to ensure that the best interests of our country are always honoured and maintained. To do that, they must also support the fundamental structure of this budget.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The budget is a major turning point. As the government makes a smaller call on the nation's savings, more money is available to invest in Australian industry and to prevent the sale of Australian companies overseas. This is a very important element of this budget strategy. There is widespread national concern about the level of foreign investment in our country and about the sale of Australian companies to overseas interests.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In addition to the gross foreign debt of our country, which currently stands at about $220 billion, there is something over $180 billion of foreign equity in Australian companies, bringing total foreign investment in our nation to around $400 billion. That is a lot of debt, a lot of allegiance we owe to masters in other parts of the world who are affecting our capacity to manage our country as we see fit. It is important for our country to get control of its own agenda again. To do that, we must rely less on borrowings from overseas and be able to demonstrate that we are able to balance our own budgets.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The overwhelming direction of the budget has been to benefit the people of Australia. It is true that in cutting expenditure there will be some pain. One of the aspects of this budget that has been appreciated by Australians has been the commendable way in which the government has at least endeavoured to share the pain evenly. Almost everyone has found that there is some little area where they will be adversely affected. But most Australians are accepting that there needs to be a little pain in our national interest, that we cannot continue to go on living beyond our
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         means. Most Australians are prepared to say, `I will do my little piece so long as others are seen to also be fairly bearing the burden.' That has been one of the successes of this budget: it is seen to be fair; it is seen to be inflicting the burden of our national load evenly on all Australians.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Those on high incomes are being asked to contribute more than those on low incomesâ€”and that is fair. Business is being asked to bear some of the burdenâ€”and that is fair. Even pensioners are being asked to bear a very small part of that burdenâ€”and that is fair, too, and they recognise that  fairness.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are many benefits in the budget. There are no increases in income tax, sales tax, company tax or fuel excise. When did we last have a budget, particularly a budget after an election, where that claim could be made? Prior to the election almost every Labor government said that there would be no increases in taxes, but immediately after the election, even though they had access to the books before the election, they knew what the bottom line was going to be: almost invariably the Labor government's first budget after the election was a sorry litany of increased taxes and higher charges.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That has not happened here. Even though the new government was ambushed by a $10.3 billion deficit, we have been able to bring down a budget without increases in income tax, sales tax, company tax or fuel excise. The billion dollar family tax package, the capital gains tax relief for small business, the private health insurance rebates, the increased tax free threshold for self-funded retirees, the retention of the diesel fuel rebate scheme and a host of other tax measures will help provide incentive and security for the future.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But it is not just all about tax increases, tax reductions and deficit reductions. There is a lot of good news in the budget on the expenditure side as well. There is increased expenditure on roads in this budget. It is not as much as I would like, but it is the second biggest road budget in Australian history. The task of providing a satisfactory road system for our nation is essential for our export trade and our economic future. We need to be
        <break page="4142" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         devoting more expenditure to upgrading the road system. Sadly, over recent years, Labor has allowed our national asset, our road system, to deteriorate.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Programs such as the black spots program had been axed altogether. Even though fuel excise had grown almost sevenfold under the life of the Labor governmentâ€”fuel's proportion of the tax receipts was growing and Tax's share of the cost of fuel was growing, in spite of that $10 billion revenue from fuel exciseâ€”Labor was actually spending less and less on roads.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am pleased that this budget turns that around, reinstates the black spots program and spends more money on local and regional roads. We can, at last, start addressing the enormous task of repairing our damaged national road system. But, as I said, more still needs to be done. I hope that in subsequent budgets the government can build upon its commitment to our road system.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I also welcome the increased funding in areas such as relationships counselling. Our country pays a very high price for failed relationships. We spend billions of dollars each year on the effects of relationship breakdowns, but the cost is not only economic; perhaps the greater cost is to our society. It is always a sad day for me when I get a call about someone with problems with the Family Court system or with the Child Support Agencyâ€”and there are of course scores of problems with the way in which those particular agencies operate. But the saddest part about those calls is that, more often than not, there is little I can do to help them, and there is little I can do to help them because there is such an absence of goodwill, the broken relationship is bitter and there is often an intense desire to get even.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The real losers in all of that dispute and bitterness are not the couple themselves but, more often than not, their children, their families, their parents, their grandparents and everyone associated with them. Many lives are destroyed permanently when a relationship breaks down, so I welcome the government's initiative to provide additional funds in this area. Again, it is not enough but it is a start and a positive indication that this government
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         is serious about doing something to keep relationships together rather than having to always bear the cost of the failure of a marriage or family. There is so much that needs to be done in that regard.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The government's initiative in targeting families in this budget is especially good news. The $1 billion tax breaks through higher tax free thresholds for families with children are a very positive initiative and will be warmly welcomed. That initiative is available not just to families with high taxable incomes, not just to families with taxable incomes at all; the benefits are available to all families. So there will be real cash benefits to help families with the extra expenses they have in raising children.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I welcome especially also the boost in funding for education and for schools. The abolition of Labor's new schools policy is warmly welcomed in the community. Of course it was generally referred to as a no new schools policy because it made it very difficult for new schools to open up and to receive Commonwealth funding.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The fact is that many parents these days are exercising the option of a private education for their children. They are choosing to pay the fees to go to a school with often far inferior facilities to what is available in the state schools and where they have to work twice as hard to mow the lawn and provide the basic facilities for the school that they would never have to at a state school. They are making that decision, they are making that choice because they believe that the quality of that education is superior or because it particularly meets the needs of their children.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think it is high time a government acknowledged that freedom of choice and provided appropriate support to families who choose that option. We are not neglecting the state school system. There are additional funds available also in this budget to assist state schools with their capital works and to ensure that there are appropriate programs to support the schooling system.

        We on our side do not argue against getting the budget into surplus. In fact, Labor has produced the only surplus budgets in the history of this country.

Helping those who need it, particularly the long&amp;hyphen;term unemployed, requires an investment by the nation, as does developing the skills of the work force. Government cannot simply be about cutting costs. It has to be about investing in our most valuable asset: our people.

        In all of these objectives there is a vital role for government, but this budget takes the opposite path: it abrogates a role for government. In doing so it consigns Australia to lower growth and higher unemployment. If anyone needs any evidence of that today, look

        In office, Labor did pursue an active government role for government.

        This figure is not enough to create the conditions necessary for employment growth. The budget sees revenue rising this year by $8&amp;half; billion and outlays by just under $4 billion. But with economic growth as per what Labor delivered, the increase in revenue would have been about $1 billion higher and outlays about $400 million less. A net contribution to the underlying budget deficit would come in at over $1 billion less than that which is budgeted for, $5.6 billion. Our scenario would also see the budget return to surplus by 1999&amp;hyphen;2000â€”a longer path to surplus than the coalition's, but with stronger economic growth and better job opportunities.

This is a mine that was closed some years ago and has now reopened. They have world leading technology, which they want to develop, aimed at finding a more efficient method of extracting copper. It could work not only for copper but also for extracting other minerals as well. It would add value to our natural resources; it would mean not exporting the waste, but doing something with it here.

        It is also scrapping the shipbuilding bounty. This is a program that Labor introduced back in the late 1980s. It has seen ships exported from this country, mostly the wave&amp;hyphen;piercing catamarans, such as people who have been overseas would have travelled on. These are all built in Australia with support from this program. But the bounty took the industry production up by close to 200 per cent. It saw export growth of 150 per cent and jobs growth of 50 per cent. For what? An investment of about $9 million a year. Again, I say to you: isn't this what Australia should be encouraging?

What sort of

We saw the export of books from this country grow by 200 per cent in the last 12 years. We have seen businesses grow up in many rural and regional centres. In the Victorian country town of Maryborough, for example, 25 per cent of the local work force is directly dependent upon this growth in the book industry.

        The budget also terminates the computer bounty and the machine tools and robotics bounty. Both of those industries have trebled exports in the last five years. It abolishes the DIFF scheme, the one that Alexander Downer has come to grief over. Again, the DIFF scheme is not a cost to the budget. For every dollar spent, it returns $3.50 to the nation. The budget cuts the export market development grants scheme. For every dollar spent there, through a multiplier effect, up to $25 returns to the nation. These are not costs. They are investments in Australia. They are investments in Australia's future and investments in Australia's jobs.

A straight quote, I might say, out of the audit commission. But what a joke! Here is a manâ€”the pretender to the National Party leadershipâ€”claiming that the Australian government has no role in regional economic development.

        It is nonsense to say that the Australian government has no role in regional development. Through the regional development program we ensured an active role for the Commonwealth. Our approach, which was endorsed by the McKinsey report just after the budget but which the government has decided to scrap, was that the program should continue. It is a report that cost $700,000â€”that is $7,000 a day. It found that the regional development program had made a significant start in rejuvenating leadership in Australia's regions and that it had the potential to make a significant impact on the growth of regions. It recommended the continuation of funding: $50 million over five years to support the structures and $25 million over five years for `seed' funding and infrastructure funding.

We have to pull together as a team, not pass the responsibility to some other level of government. All levels of government have to work together with the regions, giving them ownership. Under our strategy for regional development, we will reinstate the support for REDOs. We will provide program funding for infrastructure redevelopment. We will give regions more say in the way in which programs are delivered, and we will, in partnership, work with them to get them to identify and develop a regional agenda. We intend to win back the confidence of the regions, but unlike the coalition we will not betray them. We are prepared to back them.

         This is a budget deserving of the highest condemnation. It destroys the prospects for economic growth and with it the prospects for job growth. It fails to tackle the difficult problems, such as long-term unemployment. It sees the government walking away from effective involvement in industry policy in this country, and it represents the betrayal of regional Australia by a coalition government. The unemployed, Australian industries, fami lies and regions are all part of mainstream Australia, but this is not a budget for them. Accordingly, we will be supporting the amendment moved by the shadow Treasurer and will be seeking to oppose those aspects of legislation that come before the House to try to reverse the ridiculous decisions; the most graphic evidence of the failure being the increase in unemployment this month. We are now seeing what the John Howard coalition government produces: high unemployment, low wages and no commitment to the future.

I should know; I represent the regional seat of Murray. I can assure the honourable member for Hotham that my regional constituents are very pleased with the way this government has not simply spoken platitudes but has directly addressed the problems. Rural people like my constituents have been working very hard with incredibly low returns and seeing their product on international markets penalised because of the industrial relations environment in this country. We are forever competing head on with countries which can produce their meat products onto markets at a fraction of the cost that we can, even though when the bullock carcass leaves the farmer it is many dollars below what their counterparts produce elsewhere in the world.

So it is no wonder that, when they had a good hard look at the budget, all of Australia has been congratulatory and relieved. This is the budget they have been hoping for over the last decade.

The previous speaker, the member for Hotham, seemed to have a problem with that, but we are not going to mention figures because it is more complicated and more complex than that. It is much more important for us to look at a multifaceted strategy than to simply pluck a figure out of the air and then produce mickey mouse training programs so that we can show by a sleight of hand that the numbers of unemployed have miraculously been reduced. What we are going to do is create real work, not for the sake of that real work in itself but so we have an environment where business can thrive and create the jobs which give dignity and fulfilment in the lives of individuals. We will create the wealth of the nation by working hard together.

         â€”I rise in support of the amendments to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1996&amp;hyphen;97 moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Gareth Evans. In doing so I wish to draw to the attention of the House the effects of this Liberal budget in my electorate.

        The member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) made a very big deal about how his government would have the interests of Mr and Mrs Namadgiâ€”as he referred to themâ€”at heart when he courted my electorate during the election campaign. Despite those smug claims, Prime Minister Howard's first budget offers nothing to the residents of Namadgi. The budget offers nothing to the unemployed, it inflicts a great deal of unnecessary pain on thousands of ordinary Australians in my electorate and proves beyond any doubt that Prime Minister Howard's promises can never again be believed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The greatest failure of this budget is that it does nothing to solve Australia's greatest economic problemâ€”unemployment. In fact, it only makes it worse. The effect of this budget can only be to take growth and therefore jobs out of the economy. Despite the deluded rantings of the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), no-one on this side of the House is arguing that the budget deficit should be ignored, but we firmly believe that it should be dealt with in a way that does not reduce growth and employment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Higher growth is good because it means that more jobs will be created, incomes will be higher and business conditions improved. Increased growth means less spending on unemployment benefits and more taxation revenue because more people have jobs. Put simply, the higher the level of growth, the smaller the level of cuts needed to balance the budget. But, instead of striving for higher growth, the government has miserably opted for lower growth.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The effect of this budget on the residents of Namadgi is dramatic. The Howard Liberal government has continued its arrogant disregard for the Canberra community by savaging the public service, starving the construction

         industry and gutting higher education. During the recent election campaign the former Liberal member for Canberra went around this town promising a 2,500 limit on the number of public sector job cuts. However, thousands of jobs have already been lost directly through cuts to public programs and services. Many more jobs will be lost indirectly from the effects of lower government spending on private businesses and local communities and because the budget reduces growth, tens of thousands of new jobs that could have been created over the next two years will not now be created.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The coalition has shown a punitive, short-sighted attitude towards the public service over many years. This budget is no different. The Community and Public Sector Union reports that over 27,000 public service jobs have been targeted for cutting, or have already been cut, with more to be targeted as the year goes on. The government's own budget papers state that 10,500 public service jobs will be cut from June 1996 to June 1997. This is over and above the job cuts already announced.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Public service jobs are not the only ones being destroyed by the Prime Minister's cuts. The simple fact is that when you cut public service jobs, you also destroy job opportunities for other workers out in the private sector. In Canberra, the strength and the viability of the private sector is more dependent on the public sector and government decisions than in any other city in the nation. The growth of small and medium business in this town is reliant on certainty and stability in the public sector.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The inter&amp;hyphen;relationship between the two sectors is vital. For example, the relocation of staff and eventual closure of the Tuggeranong CES office will cause local private businesses to suffer. Already, small and medium businesses in my electorate, places like clothing retailers and cafes, have had to lay off workers because of the cuts. In fact, a small business operator said to me only last weekend in the Hyperdome, `Johnny Howard said things would be better with him. Well, they're not.'

         A further blow to the local economy comes from the government's decision to abandon the construction of new buildings for the Department of the Environment, the National Film and Sound Archive and the Australian Federal Police. This decision was taken despite the justified need for these buildings and the obvious positive effects the construction would have on the local economy, employment and business confidence.

        <para first-indent="16">
         By failing to meet the accommodation needs of the environment department alone the government has incurred additional property operating costs of $1.5 million over the next three years. This is not the only example of false economy. The Australian Federal Police Association has criticised the government's decision not to go ahead with construction of the national headquarters for the AFP because the age and condition of the existing accommodation makes necessary computer and technology upgrades difficult and expensive to install.

         The government's pre&amp;hyphen;budget announcement of significant cuts to higher education was a pathetic attempt to con parents and students that not much had changed, that the higher education budget had only been `given a little nick', to quote a minister. This is an outrageous claim, particularly given that the coalition promised before the election to `at least maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities both in terms of operating grants and research grants'. There can be no doubt that the proposed changes to HECS and university funding will have a big effect on current students and an even bigger effect on young Australians who hope to gain a university education. Cuts to the universities will mean a reduction in the number of government funded places. As a result, young Australians from ordinary families will miss out on places while those from wealthier families will be able to buy a place if they miss out on a government funded place.

          I fear that Mr and Mrs Namadgi will find that paying full up&amp;hyphen;front fees is the only way to get a university place for their child in institutions where the Howard government has cut gross funding. A crucial aspect of the proposed changes to HECS is the decision to make existing students start paying their HECS debt at a much lower income, $20,700 instead of $28,500. The lowering of the repayment threshold from average weekly earnings removes one of the key measures of fairness in the system. Make no mistake, it will lead to continued reductions in the future.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          During the recent election campaign the Prime Minister promised Mr and Mrs Namadgi additional places in family day care and retention of the non&amp;hyphen;means tested child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate and of the system of child&amp;hyphen;care assistance. These commitments have not been kept either. Despite the Prime Minister's claims, many Namadgi families will find that the Liberals' family tax initiative will not cover increased costs they will have to bear as a result of the budget. For example, Mr and Mrs Namadgi on a combined income of $47,000 a year with two children in child care for 50 hours a week will have to pay $14.93 a week more, and extra if their children go to community based long day care. The Howard government's family tax initiative gives Mr and Mrs Namadgi just $7.70 a week, leaving them $7.23 a week worse off.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another point: Ms Namadgi, a sole parent earning $28,000 a year and studying one night a week, with two kids in child care for 55 hours, will have to pay $41.69 a week more, extra if the children go to community based long day care. The Howard government gives Ms Namadgi only $17.30 a week extra. She is therefore $24.39 a week worse off.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Previously Mr and Mrs Namadgi had a threshold of $30 per week of income per child that the government exempted when calculating child&amp;hyphen;care assistance. That does not count any more and will result in lower levels of assistance. If Mr and Mrs Namadgi work long hours, the Howard government is now saying they have to pay full costs once child care goes over 50 hours a week. In addition, the government has frozen the amount of child&amp;hyphen;care payments families can receive for the
          <break page="4153" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           next two years. At the same time they are allowing the minimum fee which Mr and Mrs Namadgi have to pay to rise. This will increase the gap between government assistance and the rate actually charged by the centre.

         <para first-indent="16">
          In marked contrast to these pathetic efforts of the government, the former Labor government had a long history of achievement in child care: the introduction of child&amp;hyphen;care assistance, the child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate and operational subsidies for community based child&amp;hyphen;care centres. Most importantly, child care was made much more affordable and available. The difference between Labor and the conservatives is that we actually believe in families having a choice to access flexible, affordable, high quality child care. This budget represents the first step towards undoing all those achievements. The increased child&amp;hyphen;care costs will almost certainly make many women think twice about re&amp;hyphen;entering or remaining in the work force.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Now let us look at the government's planned creation of a new statutory authority to be known, I understand, as `the Agency'. This agency will be formed out of the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and will take on the current responsibilities of the Department of Social Security in addition to the registration, assessment and referral of the unemployed. It is intended that the agency will be established in July of 1997 and the transformation completed by December of that year.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This proposal raises serious questions for jobseekers in my electorate. What will the agency actually be doing? Will the unemployed clients still be able to deal personally with case managers? How will the touch screen referral service operate? Will all referrals be given centrally from the agency or will the client have to travel to each EPE or PEPE to get their referral? It appears that the new all&amp;hyphen;singing, all&amp;hyphen;dancing agency will do little to actually improve services to the unemployed. Unfortunately in the case of my electorate all of the indications are that the agency will be located outside the electorate, leaving a population of nearly 100,000 people without any local service at all. I guess it is
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           just tough luck for Mr Howard's Mr and Mrs Namadgi and their kids should they happen to be unemployed. We have not even talked about the elderly, the disabled and others who travel to access Department of Social Security type services in that new regime.

          In yet another blow to Mr and Mrs Namadgi, the government has announced cuts to public hospital funding of around $1 billion over four years, which will impact on the quality of health services they can expect to receive. We already know that hospital funding grants to the states will be cut by a total of $313 million over the next four years. This reduction in funding must mean a reduction in public hospital standards and longer waiting lists. If Mr Howard's Mr and Mrs Namadgi were to take out private health insurance as the Prime Minister wants them to, it is true that they would get a rebate of up to $450 per annum. However, they are only entitled to this rebate if they fork out around $2,000, leaving them $1,500 per year worse off.

          The Prime Minister has increased the price of pharmaceuticals covered by the PBS system by up to 20 per cent. Concession card holders, including pensioners, will pay an extra 50c per prescription, but that is not all. Concession card holders will now have to pay an extra $26 a year before becoming eligible for the PBS safety net. General patients will now have to pay an extra $2.60 for prescriptions charged at the maximum rate. This means that Mr and Mrs Namadgi, who have a child with chronic asthma, for example, will have to pay an extra $52 a year for the child's 20 PBS prescriptions.

The average nursing home entry is estimated to be around $30,000 but there is no limit on what nursing homes will in fact be able to charge. Only part of this entry payment will be refunded when a resident leaves the nursing home. The government has failed to give a guarantee that nursing home residents or their spouses will not have to sell their homes to pay that new up&amp;hyphen;front fee. Pensioners who do not own their own home and do not have significant financial assets may not have to pay the up&amp;hyphen;front fee, but I ask how the government will guarantee that these people will not be discriminated against by nursing home operators who would prefer people who can pay the up&amp;hyphen;front fee.

          In addition to the new entry fees, nursing home patients will also have to pay a new means tested daily fee of up to $34. I understand that pensioners with private incomes as low as $50 a week will have to face that fee. How do I console the lady who came to see me after the budget in my electorate, a self&amp;hyphen;funded retiree whose husband is in a nursing home suffering from dementia? She is losing sleep worrying about how she can maintain his existence in that nursing home should she be faced with a fee increase of something like $34 a day.

          Mr Deputy Speaker, even after the undoubted joy of being courted and condoled by the Prime Minister, Mr and Mrs Namadgi have come out of this budget much worse off. They face increased costs for health, education and child care. Even after paying this huge price the budget will not solve our most pressing economic problemâ€”unemployment. It is all very well for the government and the Treasurer to boast that their budget has been well received but as a young person said to me last week in my electorate office, `The money market, the economists, they may like the budget, but they don't happen to live in a mortgaged family house in a street somewhere in Tuggeranong'.

        . . . I am fed up to the back teeth with the inequalities that are being promoted by the government and paid for by the taxpayer under the assumption that Aboriginals are the most disadvantaged people in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not believe that there is any assumption about the situation of Aboriginal people in this country. There are certainly other disadvantaged people, Aboriginal people are not the only disadvantaged people, but as a group there is no question that the facts demonstrate quite clearly that Aboriginal people are the most disadvantaged people in this country.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The first fact that you can look at is life expectancy. Life expectancy is conditioned by a number of factors whether it is infrastructure, housing, health, employment or whatever. If you are a non-Aboriginal male child born in Australia this yearâ€”and I have grandchildren who have been born in this country and I had another grandchild born this yearâ€”then compared with an Aboriginal male child born in this country in 1996 you have an 18-year better life expectancy. An Aboriginal female child born today compared with a non&amp;hyphen;Aboriginal female child born today in this
        <break page="4155" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         country has a 15-year less life expectancy. That is the first, hard, crushing fact of life for the indigenous population of this country, and it is a factual piece of information. There is no assumption about Aboriginal groups being disadvantaged, it is very factual.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Look at the health statistics such as the rate of diabetes in Aboriginal women. If we look at the rate of middle ear infection, in many Aboriginal primary schools up to 50 per cent of the children in those schools have middle ear infections. That means that they not only have a health problem, it means that they have an education problem as well.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is no other school outside of the Aboriginal community in this country that has got health statistics of that type. It is not uncommon, because of a lack of infrastructureâ€”clean water, clean housing, sanitation and so onâ€”to find that all the health statistics in many Aboriginal communities are quite appallingly below those of other areas of our community. When we look at education, at the number of children in the Aboriginal community who get a good education, we find that the numbers are appallingly behind those of the wider community.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Looking at housing: you travel to many of the Aboriginal and indigenous communities in this country and you will find that the overcrowding in housing is really quite disgraceful and is in fact only comparable often with the most appalling conditions in the Third World countries of this globe. I have said in this place before, for example, on trips that I have made to Aboriginal communities, it is not uncommon to find 20 or 30 people living in a house. In fact, in one community I went to in the Northern Territory, there were 38 people on average living in a three&amp;hyphen;bedroom house in the 200 houses in that community. Can you imagine 38 people living in a three&amp;hyphen;bedroom house, with one toilet and one shower, in a hot climate. It is appalling.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is nowhere else in this community or in this country where those sorts of housing numbers in fact apply. Three years ago the Industry Commission did a study on Aboriginal housing and they came to the conclusion that we required to spend over $2 billion just to bring Aboriginal housing up to the standard
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         of the rest of the community. So how could anybody possibly say that the Aboriginal community is not disadvantaged in terms of housing?

       <para first-indent="16">
        When we look at employmentâ€”and we talk in this place about employment regularlyâ€”we talk about the appalling state of the unemployment rate, which is stuck at about eight per cent. We would all like to see that improved. We may argue between the two sides of politics about how we should go about that. But the reality is that in Aboriginal communities in the length and breadth of the country, even in good times, unemployment rates are usually stuck at about 80 per cent. In many Aboriginal communities, we actually say to that community, `Don't just accept the dole, go on to the CDEP scheme', which is a scheme that I support, but it is a work for the dole scheme. I think that has many advantages, but we do not require that of non&amp;hyphen;Aboriginal people in this country. It seems to me that, there again in employment, they are a specifically identifiable group that, in fact, are disadvantaged compared with the rest of us.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Then of course we can get on to looking at the legal system and the representation in gaol. The truth of the matter is that if you are a 15&amp;hyphen; to 19&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old Aboriginal youth and you come from Western Australia, you are going to be more than 50 timesâ€”five zero timesâ€”more likely to be in custody in one form or another than if you are a non&amp;hyphen;Aboriginal youth in the same age band. I am not saying that if an Aboriginal youth commits a crime, they should not be locked up. But what I am saying is that, when you get into the areas of criminal activity or substance abuse and so on and so forth, those are usually products of the environment in which you have been brought up and the socioeconomic deprivation that you have suffered. Because Aboriginal kids suffer greater socioeconomic deprivation than the rest of our community, they tend to be overrepresented in our legal system.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Then of course you can get into the whole area of substance abuse. Again, it is not a racial thing. Across the world, in eastern Europe, in particular when the Berlin Wall came down, they found in eastern Germanyâ€”and since the USSR crumbled, they found in
        <break page="4156" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Russiaâ€”that, because of socioeconomic factors, crime is rife and substance abuse is rife in many of those countries. Amongst the areas of our community in Australia where substance abuse is most rife is the indigenous community because of the socioeconomic disadvantage that they suffer.

        The reality of life is that in this country over the last 10 years, certainly over the last 50 years and probably over the last 200, we have tried a number of measures to deal with the disadvantage suffered by Aboriginal people. We have tried full integration, we have tried full assimilation, and the reality is that it did not work. Therefore, we have to say that, as for any disadvantaged group in our community, whether it be the handicapped, whether it be the mentally ill, or any other identifiable group, special measures are needed. The evidence is there that special measures are needed for the indigenous community.

        I have criticised the former government for its failures in this area. I have acknowledged publicly its good intent but I believe that it did not make much difference, in the 13 years it was in government, to the situation of Aboriginal people. So we need to look for new ways. Just abolishing special programs and saying that these people have to be treated the same as everybody else has been demonstrated to be a failure in the past. If it is tried again in the future it will be a failure again. We have to recognise the cultural differences.

We have a legal basis on which we stay on the land we are on and to suggest otherwise is ridiculous.

         This is a popular line in some quarters of our community, that we are paying for the damage that was done 200 years ago. Anything that this parliament does, and any money and programs that this parliament may decide to put in place in respect of disadvantaged people in our community, has nothing to do directly with what happened 200 years ago. It may be somewhat of an inheritance but what we are talking about is trying to fix the problems that are here today. I recounted earlier a number of the disadvantage factors for the indigenous community. We are trying to address some of those factors, as we should.

But the reality is that we cut back on our aid and one of the projects that I went to see is not going to get its funding next year. There were children in this project that we are directly fundingâ€”not channelling through some government official so that it is all being syphoned offâ€”where we have people on the ground, where we are supervising the project, where we are making sure that we pick the people who work in there and where every single dollar that we are donating in aid is actually having a direct benefit on the poor of this world. It seems to me that if we cannot do that, frankly, I would not want to be in this country or in this parliament. It is something that we have a moral obligation to undertake.

        The first budget, cynically and deliberately introduced in electronic media and various press statements, was clearly designed to lessen the public outcry at the many broken promises and cuts to major government programs and services that had been introduced during the period of the previous Labor government. These included cuts to Aboriginal programs, cuts to labour market programs, cuts to the ABC, and cuts to the better cities program, which will have a devastating effect on electorates such as Greenway where we have such a new area and we need to have infrastructure development. The fact is that the Blacktown railway station, which is a great asset to the travelling public of western Sydney, was built under the better cities program. But we also had cuts to new migrant programs, cuts to higher education and the closure of government offices.

        Put simply, Mr Acting Speaker, we heard a lot more about the 1996 federal budget prior to 7.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 20 August than we heard on the night or have heard since. This attempt to lessen the public outrage by deliberately announcing budgetary&amp;hyphen;type decisions prior to the actual budget speech is a clear breach of Westminster tradition. This tradition
        <break page="4159" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         is that there is no official statement by the government of the day about budgetary decisions until the budget speech itself. This practice was enshrined in the Westminster system of government by the British Labour treasurer, Hugh Dalton. When he discovered that he had unintentionally breached this custom prior to delivering his 1947 budget to the British parliament, he offered his resignation to the Labour Prime Minister of the day, Clem Attlee. If the government ministers opposite were to follow this fine practice there would be very few of them left and I believe that the people of this country would be a lot better off.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of all the broken promises and cuts announced in this budget, the $1.8 billion cut to labour market programs was the most callous. It was callous because the government has said, `Yes, we have high unemployment. No, our policies are not going to reduce unemployment dramatically in the short term. High unemployment is going to continue into the foreseeable future.' They are right because only today we have heard that there has been an increase in unemployment from 8.5 per cent to 8.8 per cent. So what is the government going to do? They will wind back labour market programs and over time pass the responsibility of getting Australians back into the work force over to private enterpriseâ€”that is, unemployment is to join the profit queues of the rich and greedy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The question I ask this government is: what happens to the unemployed during this lag time between winding back labour market programs and the coalition government's policies being enacted? Clearly the responsible and humane way to go would be to retain existing labour market programs, while ever we have this high unemployment, until new programs, if in fact they do work, come into place. But, no, the government is asking the unemployed to suffer further humiliation and financial hardship. Why? Because deep down the Howard government really and truly believes that there is a group of people out there who do not want to work. While the government experiments with some new&amp;hyphen;fangled policy of developing a profit making growth industry out of getting people back

        It is ironic that the first public duty that I performed after the budget speech by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), which announced the $1.8 billion cut in labour market programs, was to address a graduation ceremony for a skillshare organisation in my electorate. At this function some 25 job seekers received certificates for completing courses in building trades, hospitality and computer operations. What impressed me most about this function was the family atmosphere, the friendly atmosphere that existed, where people were made to feel good about themselves and good about their achievements, where their confidence had been restored and where they had been put in the right frame of mind to seek employment successfully. Where is the confidence of the unemployed people going to go now under this government's policy?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I was able to report to this graduation function that the skillshare program was able to boast a 63 per cent success rate, with some 47 per cent of skillshare participants going into permanent employment and a further 16 per cent going on to further vocational training. I was able to report also to this function that the Skillshare organisation is very cost&amp;hyphen;effective. For a figure of about $1,000 you turn a social security recipient into a job seeker, who in most cases turns into a taxpaying local consumer of goods and services.

        Even the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, has conceded that skillshare is not a labour market program but is a `generally high quality infrastructure'. It was, and it remains, good for Australia and Australians. The government should think long and hard before it finally withdraws funding from this piece of high quality infrastructure.

        I will give the final say on this issue to a constituent of mine, Mr Terry Fendick, who wrote to me on 17 August. While we have heard from the other side how good this budget is, we have had very few hard facts about what people in the electorates are saying. Well, here is what a person in the electorate of Greenway is saying about the cuts to higher education. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        On Friday (9 August 1996) the federal government announced a crushing blow to potential tertiary students of limited means. My daughter is one such person who was hopeful of gaining a tertiary placement in 1997.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Up until that Friday she was preparing herself to accept many long, hard hours of dedicated study plus the cost of student union fees, writing materials and many, many reference/text books, and after all that emerging from an extremely intense four year university course with a $10,000 HECS debt. However, now she is devastated having to face a HECS debt of nearly double that previous repayment.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I suppose my daughter and many like her would have accepted a twenty or even thirty per cent rise in their HECS commitment, but double seems to be unfair and unreasonable.

        The government seems to have taken a shallow view of university funding and in the long term may regret this decision when it is forced to recruit professional expertise from overseas because it discouraged highly motivated students in Australia from seeking further education.

       <para>
        That says quite clearly what I am sure a lot of people out there, the battlers in western Sydney and in other electorates, are saying. To add to that, I will quote from another letter from a constituent of mine, a Mr Steve Adamantidis of Kings Langley. He wrote:

         I will turn now to another very important issue in my electorate, the issue of child care. Under the previous Labor government the Blacktown local government area was approved as a high need area for new community based long day care places, family day care places and outside school hours places. Under Labor, western Sydney had 361 places for every 1,000 children compared with the New South Wales average of 326 places per 1000. Blacktown also had the highest relative level of long day care supply in western Sydney. Under Labor the availability and affordability of child-care facilities increased considerably.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         All this will disappear under the coalition's heartless cutbacks. The removal of the operational funding for community based long day care centres will seriously affect young families who send their young children to community and council operated child-care centres. Blacktown Council operated 20 long day care centres. These centres were operated on a break-even basis. Fees are set taking into account all forms of operating costs. There is no profit from the service and all surplus funds are returned to keep fees at a minimum.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If the council is to provide the same level of child-care service, fees for children attending long day care centres will rise by $23 per week, a hugh amount for the battlers of western Sydney, taking the fee to $161.50 per week. Any fee increase will have a major impact on young, working families. It will force one parent to leave work to look after their children or else force parents to pay higher fees. Either way, this decision is going to have a major impact on Mr Howard's western Sydney battlers.

         I will now move to another area, aged care: the aged is another group which has done particularly badly out of this budget. This is extremely disappointing because Aged Care Australia made strong representations to all candidates prior to the March election. I recall receiving correspondence from them and
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          personal representations. They drew attention to the growing problem of dementia within our society and the need for additional money to maintain or replace aged care buildings. They also referred to the need for increasing finance to cover spiralling costs of daily care of nursing home residents. With our aging population more people are making use of community care. Additional funds are urgently needed in this area also. We simply cannot wish these problems away or try to dump them on charitable groups. It is our collective responsibility to accept this challenge.

         Aged Care Australia in their pre&amp;hyphen;election representations sought urgent government action to develop in 1996 a new scheme to assess the unique care required for people with dementia that better reflects the additional cost of providing care in hostels, nursing home and community care packages. All candidates were advised that there are presently over 240,000 people with dementia throughout Australia and the number is growing. While most people with this illness live in the community there does come a time when family carers have to seek respite care in a nursing home or hospital. At this stage governments have not recognised that people with dementia need additional personal care over and above what is already provided in a nursing home or hostel. Increasing numbers of people living in nursing homes and hostels have moderate to severe dementia. What did aged people and the aged care providers get in the budget? Firstly, they got a pretty big fright. This fright was in the proposal that people who are not on a pension would have to pay an up-front fee ofâ€”and the figure here is not clear but certainly we could sayâ€”$30,000 upwards which is negotiable. These are people who were not on a pension. Entering a nursing home necessitated, it was first suggested, the sale of the family home.

The promise of special funding for dementia patients to apply from 1 January has not been honoured. The most unkind cut of all, Mr Acting Speaker, was the withdrawal of the in-principle funding for some 87 new nursing homes in New South Wales; and at least one nursing home in my own electorate, the Holy Family Nursing Home at Marayong, has been affected this way where they did have an in-principle agreement under the previous government to provide 11 new beds. So as not to interfere with the forward planning, it would have been expected that any reasonable government would have at least honoured existing agreements.

         â€”Mr Acting Speaker, the first budget of the coalition government lays the foundations for a better future. Despite the many legacies and problems left to all Australians by Labor, the Howard coalition government's first of many budgets is a sensible package of repairs and positive initiatives for the future. The budget is the first step in ending the Labor fantasy that they could somehow `belt the Bankcard' year after year to fund unsustainable levels of expenditure. The twentieth of August 1996 was rejection day for the Labor notion that current-day excesses could simply be passed on to our children as debt.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Labor's last dishonest legacy to the Australian people was a $10.3 billion budget deficit, a deficit that the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) thought was going to be a surplusâ€”a $718 million surplusâ€”a surplus he assured Australian voters that his government was on track for; a surplus that proved to exist only in his imagination; a surplus that the same officials at his fingertips later informed a conscientious coalition Treasurer was not a surplus at all.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        After the smoke and mirrors were cleared, Australians were greeted with the Beazley black hole. Labor's phoney and fudged claims of surplus simply disappeared. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition's ability to make a surplus disappear to reveal a whopping big deficit made him look like the David Copperfield fiscal magician of this House. In fact, you could almost see the transformation of a Labor dodgy surplus to  more deficit and more debt for Australians to bear.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But there was more to the Leader of the Opposition's `Copperfield Combo'. This surplus he assured us all was there was resting, like a trophy to Labor's deficit reduction strategy, on the fiscal credibility of the member for Brand (Mr Beazley). There it was. You could almost see it. And then, with a wave of coalition budget honesty and
        <break page="4163" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         accountabilityâ€”puff!â€”it was gone. Not only was the surplus gone to reveal a huge budget deficit, but so was the Leader of the Opposition's fiscal credibility. It just vanished. There was a $10.3 billion budget deficit just left hanging there, an opposition leader without fiscal credibility and a disgraced Labor Party with no idea of how to approach one of its ugliest creations. It was not a pretty sight, Mr Acting Speaker.

        It was a legacy left by Labor to be repaired by the Howard coalition government; a repair job that Labor can only snipe and gibe at; a fiscal restoration that Labor cannot contribute to and can barely comment on, given the credibility-free zone the opposition leader created through his `Copperfield Combo'.

Apart from helping families, the other clear aim of the budget is to cement in the gains that have recently allowed interest rates to fall half a percentage point.

Is this revelation about your policies the reason why you will not table the NILS report or set an unemployment target?

That is the sort of unemployment record that you have given to the Australian people.

A superannuation system that delivered 33 per cent concessions to upper income earners but did not deliver anything like that benefit to lower income earners was not a fair concession. The government moved, with its budget announcement, to deal with that. The government welcomes statements by the Australian Democrats that they support this equity and fairness measure. The Labor Party is apparently yet unable to come to a view on it.

        Of course, it is a very interesting proposition to consider as to how much did the previous government inform the workers of AN and the public of Australia about the business plan that it had developed for AN which has now led to these proposed measures possibly being undertaken. Both the former Minister for Transport, the member for Kingsford-Smith, and the former Minister for Finance were well aware of this business plan last year as it was developed. Indeed, there was correspondence from the former Minister for Finance congratulating AN for the business plan that was under way at the time.

        Indeed, it is an interesting proposition to put to the House as to how much of the truth about AN's plans did the former government reveal to the workers of AN and to the people of Australia. For example, when the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and the former transport minister, the member for Kingsford-Smith, visited AN's workshops at Islington during the election campaign, did they inform them that they had developed and were approving a business plan which would lead to 950 job losses in the next financial year or indeed which would lead to the sale of parts of AN's business? Did they inform the workers at AN's workshop of that when they spoke with them? No, of course they did not.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It proves the very point that I was making in the House yesterday: the previous government deceived and betrayed the workers at AN over the future prospects of AN, as indeed it deceived the public of Australia. This government has inherited that problem and it is this government which will resolve it to the satisfaction of all Australians. But you can rest assured that, if the previous government had been left in office after the 2 March election, the workers at AN would have realised the betrayal of their Labor colleagues in the administration of their business.

Mr Evans, the man appointed by the former Keating government and reappointed by the incoming Howard government as the principal economic adviser to both governments, sees the link between a freer labour market and the level of unemployment.

Until this government's new policies are allowed to be implemented, until we are given a fair opportunity to turn the situation around, you will be held responsible as you should be by the Australian people for having created such a disastrously high level of unemployment.

The government has put forward a number of initiatives to ensure that Australia's three million school students will have access to the world's most advanced technologies and to improve their learning opportunities.

Australia's 10,000 schools will be receiving an additional $167 million in 1996&amp;hyphen;97, a five per cent increase in real terms and including a $45 million literacy and numeracy strategy.

         â€”There will be a $55 million saving to Australia's 10,000 schoolsâ€”in addition to the $167 million increased funding in the budget. The bulk purchasing agreement is going to enable schools across the nation to buy computers, Internet modems and other technology hardware at significantly discounted prices. It is estimated that schools will save up to 30 per cent on each purchase, and the cheaper prices are also going to be available to higher education institutions, to training and vocational education institutions as well. It is a breakthrough agreement which allows schools across the nation, particularly small and rural schools, to improve and provide students with the nation's most advanced technologies.

An advanced technology training program will help create and promote apprenticeships in new industries, such as multi media, and other technology based industries. That program is part of a $71 million package to modernise the training system.

        The federal government is committed to ensuring that Australia's school students and apprentices have every opportunity to capitalise on the technology revolution. This is going to be of particular benefit to students in regional Australia. It will provide them with the links that they need to gain an equality of access to information with students in all other schools. Of course, the member for Hotham is interested in regional Australia because he seems to be adopting the Mao strategy of mobilising the countryside and the leaders in the Labor party and then finally targeting the centre. That is what he is on about with his regional strategy. But our regional strategy is going to provide Australian students with the opportunities they have been denied over the last 13 years.

         â€”I thank the honourable member for his question. I am aware that there is genuine concern amongst medical students at the change, and that is understandable. There are two very substantial benefits to this change. The first is that it will increase the standing of general practice by not allowing it to be an area that just receives people who do not want to go anywhere else. It will increase the quality of general practice. The second thing it will do is it will help constrain the unrestrained growth of Medicare, which is essential for its long&amp;hyphen;term viability.

        On the issue of career prospects for medical students that the member raises, I make the
        <break page="4178" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         following comments. The work of the Australian Medical Council is successful, it is bearing fruit, and we are finding that specialist positions are expanding. There may be up to 600 places next year for specialists, so there will be greater opportunity there than there has been in the past. Secondly, the number of general practice places will be 400, and we are having discussions with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners to make sure that that training is sufficiently flexible to take into account the needs of women or people who want to have part&amp;hyphen;time or interrupted training. Thirdly, a good number of medical students today do not choose to practise clinical medicine on graduation; they may go into academia or administration and will not have a need for a provider number.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the end, the number of doctors that may miss out, so to speak, will depend on two things: the number of overseas&amp;hyphen;trained doctors coming to Australia and medical student intakes. I am very optimistic that this measure will reduce the number of overseas&amp;hyphen;trained doctors seeking to come to Australia, something that successive governments have been trying to do for a very long time but have been very unsuccessful about. But I am also optimistic that we might be able to get a reduction in 1997 in medical student intakes.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        All that together I think will mean that career prospects are actually very good and far better than many students fear. For the honourable member's information, I am meeting with representatives of medical students and resident trainees from all around Australia next week, and if there are any implementation concerns we will do our best to meet them.

For those of us who have been here for some years and have witnessed at first hand Labor's economic record and the failings of their record, to have them lecturing us by way of a question on unemployment is absolutely incredible.

        During question time we have had a number of questions from the opposition about the impact of our workplace relations bill. The reality is that not only are they opposing measures designed to fix the problems that they created but they are also opposing certain provisions that go to the existence or otherwise of junior wage rates. They feign concern about the young unemployed in this country, but the truth is that within the existing Brereton law sitting there like a time bomb waiting to go off is a proposal to abolish junior wage rates, which on the estimates of the Retail Council of Australia could cost of the order of 200,000 jobs for young people out of a total of 285,000 jobs. Not only are they feigning concern about the situation facing young people; in the Senate they are preparing to vote against the proposition that will actually secure the jobs of young people.

Yesterday, after receiving advice from the Chief Executive and Principal Registrar of the High Court of Australia that the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, had ordered the election for Lindsay held on 2 March 1996 was absolutely void and having received legal advice that the Acting Speaker could exercise the powers of the Speaker in relation to the issue of writs, the Acting Clerk contacted the Australian Electoral Commission with a view to ascertaining appropriate dates for the election which might form the basis for consultation with party leaders and Independent members.

       <para first-indent="16">
        During discussions with the Electoral Office, it became apparent that there seemed to be an emerging opinion which questioned the right of the Speaker to issue a writ for an election in such circumstances, primarily due to doubt as to whether there was a `vacancy' in the House of Representatives for the purposes of section 33 of the constitution. The House should be aware that, of the five similar circumstances where elections have been declared null and void, the Speaker has issued a writ on four occasions. In the fifth instance, involving Mr Cleary in 1992, the by&amp;hyphen;election would have been subsequent to the resignation from the House of Mr Hawke.
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         A writ was not issued in the light of an impending general election, although the Speaker's authority to act after the High Court's decision was not called into question.

        Whenever a vacancy happens in the House of Representatives, the Speaker shall issue his writ for the election of a new member, or if there is no Speaker or if he is absent from the Commonwealth the Governor&amp;hyphen;General in Council may issue the writ.

       <para>
        As the Speaker is currently absent from the Commonwealth on parliamentary business, the Governor&amp;hyphen;General in Council may, of course, issue a writ in the present case. However, I repeat that the larger issue is whether the Speaker, if present, would be empowered to issue the writ, as occurred in the past. Moreover, without in any way reflecting on the office of Governor&amp;hyphen;General, I believe that the process normally followed in respect of such elections has been appropriate.

         â€”A very interesting thing happened last weekend. Last weekend we saw a sea change in the government's presentation of its case on the issue of unemployment. This totally poll&amp;hyphen;driven government suddenly came to the conclusion thatâ€”whilst they felt very satisfied with their budget reception out thereâ€”growing, swelling in the community was an understanding and a concern about one thing: whatever they had to say in their budget about all the conceivable public policy issues that interest the average Australian, there was nothingâ€”nothing except a completely bleak outlookâ€”on the question of employment.

        They came to realise what every person in the public knows: you cannot talk about families, you cannot talk about young people and you cannot talk about the needs of people in or out of the work force unless you have
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         one thing at the very centre of your policies. There is no substitute for a jobâ€”not any social security payment, not any charitable institutionâ€”in keeping people's families together, in keeping people satisfied with themselves and their circumstances, in keeping for people the opportunity of a decent retirement. That, after six months in office, suddenly struck them like a silver bullet.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What did we have immediately after that? We had the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on every conceivable airwave over the weekend selling a piece of snake oil economic claptrap that, somehow or other, his policies of sacking people, his policies of depriving people of wages, which he says he is not doing, his policies of destroying people's opportunity in the labour market and his policies of destroying people's capacity to get special assistance to get themselves back into the labour market after being long-term unemployed were all amounting to a strategy that would improve our position on employment as time went by.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In question time today the Prime Minister was saying, `Don't blame us for any circumstances in which we find ourselves. We have only been in office for six months.' Indeed you have only been in office for six months. What have we seen since then? From day one, with your stupid propaganda against us, confidence in the business community and amongst consumers has been plummeting. Every measure of consumer confidence and business confidence has been plummeting during that time.

Better than that, you know there is no escaping them.

       <para first-indent="16">
        We no longer see Senator Vanstone and the minister who will follow me in this debate, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), as they were in the first six months of the year out there saying, `Don't worry about unemployment targets. Don't worry about employment. Challenge the figures because the Bureau of Statistics does not really measure these things properly. Let's set up something at NILS and get a bit of advice on how we ought to be looking at unemployment. Forget about these statistics. Forget about the measures, even though the measures are universally approved as the appropriate way to measure unemployment. No, we do not think we will be able to get unemployment below eight per cent before the end of the century because of these huge problems that are upon us.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is the rhetoric of the last six months. That rhetoric, which is so in keeping with the intentions in this budget, went out the window last weekend and what we got was snake oil, economic claptrap. It has been exposed by some of those sent out there to produce the earlier statistics. How extraordinary it was to pick up the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Sydney Morning Herald
        </emphasis>
        and see a report from Professor Wootten who did one of those studies to supposedly come up with a proposition that we ought to take no account of the way in which things have been measured in the past and we have to have a new scenario in relation to what employment opportunitiesâ€”I will not say `employment targets'â€”might be.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Professor Wootten had a specific question put to him which was along the lines of the one put to the Prime Minister today who claimed so much about his industrial relations policies. What did he say? He said that over the next four years he did not think the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         measures would `do anything for unemployment'. For the rest of this century it will not do anything for unemployment. This is one of the government's advocates when in opposition in years past and one of the government's researchers.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government has been trying desperately over the last six months to get out of the minister's department advice that all the targets that we put up were unachievable, that we should have no targets at all and that really we can live with eight or 10 per cent unemployment. They have not been able to get that out of that department so they went to NILS to get it out of them. What did they get out of NILS? They got a torpedo amidships straight into the heart.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Professor Wootten could be forgiven for going off the theme in that particular context because I bet he had not been advised of the change of lines after the polls over the weekend. They forgot to ring Professor Wootten. They rang round all their spokesmen. They rang Senator Vanstone. She appeared on the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         7.30 Report
        </emphasis>
        last night. She said, `Forget all the things I have been saying about unemployment, Kerry. We should be able to get unemployment down. If we do not get unemployment down we might not get elected at the next election. Gee, what a thought.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Poor old Professor Wootten was left hanging out to dry on the previous advice that came forward from the government. He did say that perhaps some time into the distant reaches of the next century we might see things coming out of these industrial relations policies that might actually produce a few jobs. He said that we should not think about anything over the next four years. That is the most comfort you can get from your own advisers in this area.

        You are already accountable for the last six months. You are already accountable for these figures. What do we see in the budget?

When you pull out that rabbit and put it back you then pull out its twin. The twin has jobs on it. What does the twin say, `This is a rabbit that is about two-thirds the size at best of the previous one that has been operating so effectively in creating jobs over the last four years.'

        The problem with this government is that it has spent 13 years on employment, frozen in aspic. An extraordinary task was imposed on us during our 13 years in office. We absorbed, by creating employment and catering for changes to our institutions and to our labour market programs, an extraordinary sea change in the structure of the Australian labour market. That extraordinary sea change was the admission of womenâ€”the majority of women now; it was not the case beforeâ€”into the work force. That is what we presided over: an extraordinary sea change in the life of Australians.

         the puny participation rates that he presided over when he was Treasurer, do you know what the maximum figure on unemployment would have been during the 1991 recession? Seven per cent. Do you know what the figure would be now? We would be having an argument with you now, with the last set of figures, about the growth in unemployment from 3&amp;half; per cent to four per cent.

        You had a puny task; we had a massive task. But let me tell you: you now live with the consequences of that. You have now got to deal with the fact that we have a completely changed basis to our labour market position. But you have got a plus: over the next decade the rate of growth of the Australian labour market, operating at about 2.2 per cent regularly while we were in office, is going to fall to one per cent. We absorbed that enormous increase in our participation rates. Therefore, the task over the next five or six years compared with the task that we confronted is a bagatelle. And, confronting that bagatelle, what do you do? In your own anticipation, you leave unemployment operating at eight per cent to 8&amp;half; per cent.

        What you will have to understand, because you will see some truly shocking rates for the long-term employed over the next few years, is that one of the other things we had to deal with was the technological change right through the industrialised world that produced a totally new pattern of long-term unemployment. The labour market programs which we put in placeâ€”those which you have now dismantledâ€”targeted individual needs in the individual communities in which they operated whilst addressing points of entry into the labour market. It was not based on some broad, general theory; it was what they needed. It is no accident that we were generally regarded in the industrialised world as the most successful devisers of labour market programs. The Working Nation paper, produced by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) when he was employment minister, was regarded as being exemplary.

         â€”But I do not think that the Leader of the Opposition needs to worry too much, because the member for Hotham and Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) could never get any numbers right in government. He certainly does not show much quality in getting the numbers right in opposition. He missed out on the deputy leadership. Whenever he sets a target for himselfâ€”whether it be a target in the party room, or a target in the economy with unemployment or a target within his Working Nation programâ€”he never reaches it. That must explain why the Leader of the Opposition is still looking reasonably comfortable.

        Let us have a look at some of these missed targets. We have this most extraordinary hypocrisy being put before the House today that somehow or other the government should take seriously the proposition by the Leader of the Opposition that the government should set targets. What was the record of the opposition when it was in government in achieving targets?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If we look through Working Nation, and we are fortunate to have an evaluation of it, we can see what happened to some of those targets. One of the targets was to reduce the number of people unemployed for 18 months, those in the job compact, by 47 per cent. Despite all the redefinition of the long-term unemployed into the short-term unemployed, the former minister did not even come close to achieving that target. His target was to increase job referrals for the long-term unemployed so as to help them. The fact is that job referrals for the long-term unemployed actually fell by eight per cent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Labor Party in government said that it would increase the number of subsidised jobs for unemployed people to 190,000, yet it managed to get only 54 per cent of that target. It said that it would lift the number of women in labour market programs, but women's share of labour market programs actually fell by two per cent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The fact is that anyone can set shonky targets. But targets do not create jobs; policies which address the fundamentals of the economy create jobs. There was never any chance of Labor achieving the five per cent target.

        He kept talking about the five per cent target. Look how much hope it gave the Australian people. It gave them so much hope that they swept the former government out on a tide of outrage over the failure to put in place policies that had any credibility whatever. The former government had absolutely no chance of achieving that target.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The Manager of Opposition Business in the House referred to a briefing document from the department of education. He told the House that it supposedly says the Labor Party, when it was in power, was on track to achieving five per cent. Nobody reading that document could possibly believe that is what it said. It made no prediction or statement whatever about the state of the labour market in the year 2000. There was no possibility of that target ever being realised and the Australian people knew that. Setting that target did not help the former government. This government is not going to get into the business of setting misleading targets before the people, because it is concerned to emphasise the substance of policies that will actually create real jobs.

        We come to the Leader of the Opposition, this man who in grand hypocrisy stands up before this House and says, `You should do what I actually said in government we weren't going to do.' On 30 June 1993, in a speech to the National Press Club, he said:

       <para>
        That is not an unreasonable statement. He failed completely to put into place the policies that would produce that reduction in unemployment. Unemployment did not come down; unemployment stalled. The fact is that the slowdown in the labour market which is still here as a legacy of the previous government began after April 1995. From April 1995 the whole trend of employment growth began to falter.

         In the previous year before that, Paul Keating was pumping money into the economy. He was having one of his last big spending binges, a spending binge that the weak Leader of the Opposition failed to prevent. The Leader of the Opposition was the then Minister for Finance. He could have done something. He probably had private thoughts about what he was going to achieve in the Expenditure Review Committee and how he was going to rein in government spending.

        <para first-indent="16">
         What happened? Paul Keating, the then Prime Minister, just rode right over the top of him and we had another of these big spending budgets. As government spending was pumping up the economy, inevitably on a short-term basis, growth in the year up to April 1995 was 4.6 per cent. In the following 12 months growth was much weaker at 1.2 per cent, because the fundamentals that were necessary to sustain growth and to provide Australians with real job opportunities had not been set in place. So the Leader of the Opposition rejected targets in government and now has the nerve and arrogance to come before this House and say, `We weren't prepared to accept those targets. I never believed in targets; but you should set targets.'

         Of course, the Australian people know better. They saw right through the Labor Party when they put themselves up before the election, targets and allâ€”the targets of the member for Hotham but not, as we see, targets that have any credibility with the present Leader of the Opposition. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition says things now that he was never prepared to say in government. In government he was one of the more reasonable members; he had some reasonable things to say. He told the head of Telstra that he probably supported the full privatisation of Telstra but now, apparently, they do not even support one&amp;hyphen;third privatisation.

Let me just tell the opposition some of the fundamentals they have failed to address. Australia needs savings. What did the opposition do when it was in government?

The Leader of the Opposition is living in a dream world. It is almost hallucinatory to hear his talk about job creation under the Labor Party. In the six years from July 1990 to the election how many additional full&amp;hyphen;time jobs did the Labor Party create?

Until the Labor Party is prepared to pass those programs and until Australia is allowed to get the full benefit of the policies that we have put in placeâ€”the fair and responsible policies that were brought down in the budget and the fair and responsible policies in the workplace relations legislationâ€”those jobs are not going to come through.

         The Labor Party never realised that if young people are going to get jobs they have to be literate and numerate, and they have to get training which leads them to real jobs. At the end of the opposition's term in office, between 10 and 20 per cent of young Australians coming out of primary school did not have adequate literacy or numeracy skills. That was something employers would tell them every time they visited any businessâ€”if they ever visited the businesses which were supposed to employ young Australians.

         Those opposite spent hundreds of millions of dollars churning young Australians through unemployment programs that did not lead on to real jobs. It is up to this government to solve the problems. We didn't create those problems, but we are going to fix those problems by getting back Australian savings and by bringing the budget into balance. We are going to address the problems of escalating debt that were left by the Labor Party to this country. We have increased spending on young people in crucial literacy and numeracy programs and put into place programs that will give real jobs. That is the difference between the government and the opposition.

The problem is that the Howard government does not regard the question of unemployment as a core issueâ€”despite the fact that during the election campaign the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) went around Australia trumpeting his concern about the issue of unemployment. I refer to the fact that the then Leader of the Opposition, the now Prime Minister, gave 80 speeches during that election campaignâ€”80 speeches, interviews of one kind or another, press statements, et cetera. In more than 50 per cent of those statements and speeches, the Prime Minister tried to lead the Australian public to believe that he was concerned about the issue of unemployment.

There is no sense of respectability or responsibility in any of the debate that has come from the opposition benches today on this subject of unemployment.

         The simple reality is that it does not matter whose fault it is. There is a real problem that needs to be addressed, and all of the evidence staring us in the face shows us that the techniques used to address that problem over the last 13 years have failed miserably. The coalition are about doing something about unemployment. We are being frustrated by not having a majority in the second chamber, so the things that we know must happen have not happened.

        <break page="4196" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

There will also be an increase in the number of days in a calendar year, from 42 to 52 days a year, that a carer may temporarily cease caring without affecting their qualification for carer payment. These initiatives will commence on 1 July 1997.

        At the moment, youth training and sickness allowees receive a rate of $65.75 a fortnight, even if their parents' income and assets would have otherwise either resulted in a lower rate or precluded them from payment. The bill provides for the abolition from 1 January 1997 of this minimum payment for customers aged under 18. The parental income test will then be applied to determine the actual rate of payment. This will ensure that there is a more consistent payment structure for youth, as there is no such minimum for Austudy recipients.

This commitment was made in response to community concerns that only those people who are genuinely unemployed and actively seeking to participate in the work force should receive payment.

        The government is pleased to see back in the House the Airports Bill 1996 and the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1996 in substantially the same form as was proposed to this House.

        There is no doubt that the Federal Airports Corporation has done an excellent job both in developing Commonwealth airports to the point where they provide a very healthy level of non&amp;hyphen;aviation revenue supporting the cost of providing airport infrastructure, and in cross&amp;hyphen;subsidising between airports to ensure that each Commonwealth facility has a good standard of passenger facilities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The next stage of developing these airports is to remove the constraints to pricing and investment created by the network cross&amp;hyphen;subsidies and to allow each airport to reflect the aspirations and the economics of its location. I expect that the sales process will now move into high gear and we can expect to see substantial activity from bidders and their consortiums and speculation about favoured parties.

        My colleague the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) has established sale conditions and outlined recently the open and transparent process to be followed. He has also noted that the Australian National Audit Office will be involved in assessing the performance of the process after the event.

         Indeed, there has been a very helpful and positive exchange between us on environmental matters. The government always intended a strong environmental regulation regime to apply at airports. Indeed, by comparison with the environmental regime on airports which existed under our predecessors, this government has moved light years ahead of the Labor Party. So, in many areas, the Greens' amendments reflected things that we intended to do as a matter of course under the environmental management plan or environment regulations, both of which are to follow from the Airports Bill.

         â€”The opposition is not opposing the amendments to the Airports Bill 1996 and the Airports (Transitional) Bill 1996. The bulk of them are amendments that the opposition proposed in the House. They were defeated then but subsequently were agreed to by the government in the Senate.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I would like to make some comments on some of the matters contained in those amendments. Firstly, with respect to the cross&amp;hyphen;ownership rules, we have had the last minute insertion of Perth. That has amused many of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         us. Obviously, it means that the Premier of Western Australia has been asleep or out of touch with what is going on in the world.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Premier of Victoria was running around on the question of the cross&amp;hyphen;ownership rules for some time, as were many other people. But, apparently, Richard Court has just woken up to the fact that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) is selling his airport and that he had better do something about it. So he got on the phone and said, `Hey, I want some cross&amp;hyphen;ownership protection as well.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That says a considerable amount about Richard Court's awareness of what is going on around him. It also raises the question of how much muscle Dean Brown has. Why isn't Adelaide in there as well? Maybe Tony Rundle should be asked the same question. It also indicates that the state branches and state governments still run the Liberal Party and the coalition and that, if they say jump, the federal government is going to ask how high.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It also indicatesâ€”I am sure that the minister will be pleased to hear me say this, although he will not admit itâ€”that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has been an absolute pushover on all of this. Originally, the Treasurer rolled the minister in the cabinet on this question and managed to have no cross&amp;hyphen;ownership rules at all. Then his arch enemy, the Premier of Victoria, got into the act. We indicated that we would be opposing it in the Senate, and the government got a bit worried. So the Treasurer was pushed back to the position that prevailed in the previous legislation that the Labor government put forward.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Now, as a result of a phone call from Richard Court, the Treasurer has been pushed back even further. The worry is that the total return from the sales to revenue will be diminished accordingly. I am also concerned to make sure that this is not some sort of shonky exercise designed to assist some local mates of Richard Court who have their eyes on the airport and would like to reduce competition for it. I urge the minister to pay very close attention to the sale process of Perth airport as a result.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other comments I would like to make relate to the situation in regional ports. It is
        <break page="4210" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         unfortunate that no emphasis has been placed on ensuring local ownership of regional ports. It is also unfortunate that there is no provision for ensuring full competition with respect to general aviation as between ports, particularly in the major cities. It is possible, for example, to have one owner for all the airports conducting general aviation activities in Sydney and Melbourne, which means that the potential for competition will be minimal.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I also have a number of concerns on the sale process. Some of those concerns were addressed in a letter to me from the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) in recent times. But I have a number of outstanding concerns, particularly with the pricing regime and various aspects of disclosure.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The minister has indicated that he will tell the bidders what the tendering requirements will be but he has not indicated whether anybody else, such as the parliament, will be told. It is incumbent upon the minister to indicate to the parliament precisely what the bidding regime will be, what requirements will be placed on bidders and what information will be required.

        He should also be telling us what the basis of the pricing regulation is going to be, what the commencement point will be. Will it be the current price? Will it be the intended increased price that the FAC is seeking? Where will the base be for CPI minus X? That is something that we still have not determined. There are a number of other matters that I would like to see clarified. I have recently written to the Minister for Finance on this matter and I would sincerely hope that he responds to my letter as quickly as he did to my first letter. Although the fact that my current letter has not got a run in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        might slow him down a bit.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I turn to our overall position relating to cross&amp;hyphen;ownership rules and to the sale. As I have indicated, the opposition does not have a problem with the insertion of the cross-ownership rules and does not oppose the insertion of Perth, although it does ask some questions about the distinction with Perthâ€”why Perth should be in there while Adelaide is not, and what the reason is for putting it in
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the cross&amp;hyphen;ownership provisions at the last moment, as has occurred.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This really does raise some questions about the minister's control over the whole process and the extent to which he has been consulting with affected parties. Are we to believe that Richard Court has been completely unaware of these issuesâ€”that he has no idea that the airport is going to be sold and that he has only just discovered that there are some concerns for Perth that he needs to address? Or is it the case that the minister has failed to consult adequately with state governments and other interested parties? I do not know the answer; I would be interested to know it.

He made a couple of points in his remarks, some of which he made clear have been addressed in correspondence he has had with the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey).

        The shadow minister raised a couple of points which were also raised in the Senate earlier today by Senator Collins. They go to why Mr Court suddenly showed an interest in this matter. I will recount the history of the matter. A Senate committee, chaired by Senator Winston Crane, held a hearing some time back at which the Western Australians raised the issue of some cross-ownership provisions. We took the opportunity to consider that matter. Consultations had been undertaken with the various state Premiersâ€”Mr Court in Western Australia, Mr Brown in South Australia and Mr Rundle in Tasmania. Mr Court was interested in having some cross-ownership provisions apply in the bill. Neither Mr Brown nor Mr Rundle felt it was appropriate for their states.

         arrangements in the Senate hearings and also to reflect the interests and concerns of those premiers whom the government has consulted. That is the reason for the cross-ownership provisions introduced into the Senate today. Of course, the shadow minister would know that we did introduce cross-ownership provisions for Sydney and Brisbane and Sydney and Melbourne which reflected to a great degree the cross-ownership provisions which the previous government had introduced in the legislation they brought into the parliament. The desire to introduce that reflected the content of the debate that we had here in the House of Representatives the last time we discussed this matter.

        Further, what guarantees will be given that, once the regulatory regime is established, it will not be subsequently fiddled with to favour the interests of a particular successful bidder or group of bidders? That is something that, as I have indicated elsewhere, is a particular concern given the outrageous things that have happened in the tendering process with the casino in Victoria. In that case we have seen Hudson Conway have a range of subsequent changes made to the regulations
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         governing the operation of the casino to allow it to expand substantially. Of course, these opportunities were not available to the losing bidder at the time that the original tender was called.

        Additionally, how will a pricing regime be managed if an airport operator seeks to change the basis of aeronautical charges?

        The second matter I would like to refer to quickly is the question of environmental issues. It is rather ironic that the minister should make some play of having done rather well with the Greens. Of course, the matters he refers to are also matters that ALP senators supported, with one exception which the government did not supportâ€”and I will refer to that in a minute. It is rather ironic when you consider what is going on with the proposal at Holsworthy, which clearly is environmentally crazy. It is right next to the Woronora dam and is part of the Woronora catchment area. It is adjacent to a national park. There are serious noise problems for people who were assuredâ€”as I indicated in my adjournment speech last night with respect to a sale of land by the Defence Housing Authorityâ€”as late as only a fortnight before the minister indicated that Holsworthy would be looked at as an airport site, that there was not going to be any airport there. There are also deficiencies in the EIS process. So it does not behove the minister all that well to try to parade in green clothing when it comes to airports when we consider what is going on with Holsworthy.

         I think it is also worth noting the delay, which has finally been demonstrated in the budget papers, that the Holsworthy option is causing in finding a solution for the construction of a second airport, which is clearly necessary to solve the problems with Kings ford&amp;hyphen;Smith. The $73 million provided for in our forward estimates in the previous budget has been taken out of this year's budget and not replaced in subsequent forward estimates.

        My final comment relates to the amendment that the Greens moved and which had Labor support but which was unsuccessful. I simply clarify that that amendment would have expanded the area of consultation for airport owners and required them to actually make statements in their airport master plans as to how they proposed to deal with noise problems up to the area of 20 ANEF, which is much broader than the 30 ANEF band which was ultimately adopted.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To be fair to Senator Tambling, I point out that he correctly stated that this would potentially place excessive pressure on future owners to insulate houses as far afield as the 20 ANEF band. He did not state explicitly that this would cost $1 billion to $2 billion. He did say that if the worst possible outcome occurred and they caved into this pressure that is what would have occurred. This has been reported and interpreted as meaning that the Greens' amendment, which we supported, would have added $1 to $2 billion to the budget deficit. That is entirely untrue.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        All it would simply do is place an onus on airport owners to consult more broadly and to develop strategies for noise amelioration more broadly than the outcome has imposed upon them. Whether that would have involved the expenditure of money, changes in other arrangements such as flight paths or a decision not to do anything at all would have been entirely a matter for those involved. The suggestion that that proposal would have caused additional expenditure of great magnitude is simply incorrect. I thank the House for the opportunity to refer to these matters. As I indicated, the opposition will not oppose these amendments or the bill.

        The government made a promise prior to the federal election to undertake the same noise amelioration program for areas under the east&amp;hyphen;west runway as is being undertaken at the moment for areas under the north&amp;hyphen;south flight path. Regrettably, while that program will shortly commence in a very limited area, funding in this year's budget for noise amelioration work under the east-west flight path has actually been reduced. The question that immediately arises is how adequate that noise amelioration program will be when, in effect, one area is being deprived of funds to supplement another area. It is causing very real and genuine distress. I am constantly receiving phone calls and complaints from school principals and the like.

        I appreciate that the issue of aircraft noise is an intense political one. I fear that, in relation to the environmental issue, the east-west runway is being used for statistics when during quieter periods of the day planes could take off over water. By way of example, last Saturday and Sunday I had the displeasure of painting the outside of my home. They were still days but even so during the middle of the day numerous planes flew over my area. I believe there is no reason the east-west runway had to be used during that period.

        It is significant that in August 1994 a plane crashed into Botany Bay shortly after leaving the southern end of the north&amp;hyphen;south runway. On my reckoning, if that plane had taken off on the east-west runway it would have landed in about Brighton, which is a heavily populated area. In 1990, a plane took off from the east-west runway and swung around in an endeavour to get back on the tarmac, but unfortunately it did not make it and crashed on the north&amp;hyphen;south runway killing all eight people on board.

        The statistics show that the great majority of air accidents occur within eight kilometres of an airport and primarily during take-off. The issue of planes taking off is of great significance. If an accident occurred it would

I ask the government to sincerely look at its policy on Sydney's Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith airport. Clearly, this policy of planes using the east-west runway for the sake of proving statistics and saying that it is being utilised is a recipe for disaster. It does not need to occur. Those planes could be taking off over water.

Senator Hill, the Minister for the Environment, said that this was an attempt by residents to clog up the process. He said this despite a clear government promise to have open consultation, full public involvement, a full environmental assessment.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have the Minister for the Environment breaking that commitment, breaking that promise, by saying that some people are trying to clog up the system. You cannot clog up a system whereby people are fighting for their livelihood, where people are fighting for their home values, where people are fighting for their families and their lifestyle. That is what we are talking about with Holsworthy and the south-west of Sydney.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The great bulk of the 50,000 submissions relate to Holsworthy because many people are concerned about the project. Many people have signed petitions. I know the member for Hughes (Mrs Vale) has received them, along with submissions on the guidelines. I have received them. The member for Banks (Mr Melham) and the member for Fowler (Mr Ted Grace) have received them, and even the member for Macarthur (Mr Fahey) would have received some.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So the government, because of its track record and the comments Senator Hill made on the draft EIS, needs to be watched. I also
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         believe that we should not be entrusting the member for Hume, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), with those sorts of exemptions because the documents I have seen lodged by the proponents of the Lawrence Hargrave project identify him personally as their champion within the coalition. Why should the minister, that same person, have the power to exempt this airport proponent, this private consortium, from public consultation once an airport site is established? That is also a very legitimate concern, and I raise it with regard to that second Sydney airport proposition.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I also have a concern about the process whereby, without any public announcement, apparently without revealing the advice from the Department of Transport and Regional Development, the draft EIS guidelines for the second airport have an increase in the capacity of the proposal from 275,000 aircraft movements per annum to 360,000. Of course, before the election nobody mentioned Holsworthy airport, and the coalition certainly did not mention its plan to increase the capacity for the second airport by 30 per cent. The member for Macarthur, I think the member for Lindsay, who has now gone to meet her maker in a political sense, the member for Macquarie (Mr Bartlett) and the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) all said, `We'll make the airport smaller. If we can do away with a second Sydney airport, we will.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government has gone back on that commitment and has increased the capacity for Sydney's second airport by 30 per cent. People in the seat of Lindsay and all the electorates in the south-west of Sydney should bear that in mind: this is a clear broken promise. If people in Penrith or Holsworthy or along the western or south-western population corridors in Sydney think a vote for the coalition is a vote for a smaller second airport or no second airport at all, they are mistaken.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is very important that the member for Hume reveals the basis of the advice by which he has decided to increase the capacity from Labor's planned 275,000 aircraft movements per annumâ€”it was clearly in our draft guidelines in Januaryâ€”to a whopping 360,000. We have all this after 10 years, even
        <break page="4214" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         20 years, of debate about airports in Sydney and when the Department of Transport and Regional Development and the FAC have said we need less capacity at the second airport. Their big plan and all their forecasts have always been geared around the idea of expanding Mascot, because the second airport would be an unrealistic proposition. Such was their advice for many yearsâ€”that we need less capacity, not more.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So where out of the blue did the member for Hume come up with a 30 per cent increase in capacity? This man, this member, this minister, needs to be watched. I have got my eye on him in every sense. I certainly agree with the Senate amendment that ensures he does not have the power to exempt the project of which he is a champion, the Lawrence Hargrave project, from proper public scrutiny and consultation on those vital environmental and planning issues in the south-west of Sydney.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other interesting thing is that all the rhetoric the minister has used about where the planes come from and where they go toâ€”allegedly over the national parkâ€”is word for word in that project's submission. Not only is he their champion; he is their echo.

         Under New South Wales state legislation, if an environmental impact statement is commissioned, at the end of that study a recommendation must be made on balance that the proposal, whatever it is, go ahead or not go ahead.

         It is true that our environmental legislation does not make such a provision, but the important thing honourable members in this chamber need to understand is that during the last election it was promised that Badgerys Creek, and presumably now Holsworthy, would be covered by the same commitment: that there would be a go/no go clause.

         â€”I want to speak briefly on the proposals in the Airports Bill and the generality of the effects of airport ownership on Sydney airport. We may have got a long way towards resolving some of the problems of Sydney airport if the current government had allowed the previous government's legislation on the sale of Sydney airport to go through. The worry I have with the way the present government is conducting the arrangements with Sydney airport and Sydney West airport is that we could end up with the worst of all worlds: no decision being able to be made on Sydney West airport, so Sydney airport becoming the only airport for Sydney. The effect of that would be to turn all of south-western Sydney and part of the eastern suburbs of Sydney into a noise ghetto.

        Since the election we have seen the government's disgraceful policy of so-called spreading the pain. The area of Earlwood is in my electorate. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) grew up there. He will not attend the Earlwood Public School's 80th birthday celebrations because he knows that the people of that area will want to tear him apart. That suburb never had aircraft noise before. That suburb was a quiet corner of Sydney. People who have lived there for 30 or 40 years tell me that they have never experienced aircraft noise. Twenty and 30 planes a day are now flying over their houses. They really think that the Prime Ministerâ€”the local boy made goodâ€”ought not chance his arm by coming back to see them.

         What has happened in places like Earlwood and other parts of my electorate will be tremendously exacerbated if the government cannot make a decision on where to build Sydney West airport. The only solution to noise problems at Sydney airport is to get on with building another airport that will service Sydney. We have seen in the newspapers in recent days proposals both by airbus industries and the Boeing company to build these massive new 600-seat aircraft. Members can imagine the amount of thrust that would be needed to lift an aircraft with 600 people aboard it. Imagine that noise spreading all over that part of Sydney.

Unless the government does that, that part of Sydney where nearly a million people live will turn into a ghetto. In the end, the financial imperatives will mean that the curfew will start to be sliced away. If you turn Sydney airport into a 24-hour operation airport, the lives of those people around there will be disgraceful.

This is a disgraceful, dishonest attitude that the government has adopted towards the people of my electorate in particular. While I agree with my colleague the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) with the propositions he is putting forward, I also think the government should take on board the dire need to get on with the job of building a second Sydney airport so that we can do something to relieve the traffic at the current Sydney airport.

It is very good that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) is at the table. Unemployment took up some of the consideration of the House today in question time and in the matter of public importance.

We are saying, `Set a benchmark so that we can make a judgment against

        I believe that unemployment in Tasmania will continue to rise because of this last budget and the government's attitude. There have been cuts in skillshare and in skillshare areas where people who have need of literacy and numeracy skills go. They are not the people who are getting into the TAFE colleges; they are people who have need of skillshare. You have cut 33 per cent out of the budget relating to them. New work opportunities, building skills in people, giving them the opportunity to get work right throughout Tasmania, have gone. As for long-term unemployed people having an opportunity to get back into the work force, you have given them nothing and taken everything away.

        You have failed the test as minister, and your government has failed to set a target for us, to give itself a benchmark so that people can make a judgment about it. You have failed the test, and the government has failed the test. The continuing attacks on regional areas which you have made in this budget have hit my state enormously. Tasmania is very regional, very isolated and, when you take some of the actions that were taken in this budget, they affect it greatly. You have betrayed us as a state, as you have betrayed the other regions of Australia.

         â€”I hope not, Mr Acting Speaker. Let me just touch on a couple of points where I can detail how Tasmania has been treated and how unemployment will increase in our state. There are 380 places to be cut from the University of Tasmania. Those people will either join the dole queue or, if they are lucky enough to gain employment, will replace somebody who was going for that job. Thirty places will go out of our maritime college, a major asset in the north and Launceston. According to the last report I saw, I think 33 per cent of the economic basis of that area of Tasmania is related to
         <break page="4218" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          education. So this is a major blow for that region.

        The 30 per cent cut to the Working Nation program will have enormous effects right through northern Tasmania and Tasmania generally. The cuts to road funding will have enormous effects in relation to tourism, as we were trying to increase access to certain smaller subregions in Tasmania. The ships bounty is to be abolished. It was the biggest employer in Tasmania, the main trainer of apprentices, the main trainer in Tasmania and the biggest employer of apprentices. Whack goes the ships bounty and other help that was structured to assist and build skills into that area.

        The Tamar regional environment study, which highlighted the needs and opportunities associated with that area, became an economic tourist and recreation centre. There were opportunities identified in that report and pushed forward by the regional development body, but with the loss of $150 million out of the regional fund they have nowhere to go.

         â€”I would like to draw to the attention of the House the facts about the Perth airport and the government's position in relation to airport noise. These are in contrast with the inaccurate and misleading comments made about me and the Perth airport by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) in the House last evening. By the way, unlike the member for Perth, I notified him that I would be speaking on this matter this evening.

        The member for Perth was factually incorrectâ€”incorrect when he said that the government had dropped a compensation package for noise affected areas surrounding the Perth airport and incorrect when he said, about compensation, that there is one rule for Sydney and one rule for others. The government has not dropped a compensation package for noise affected areas surrounding the Perth airport because the package did not exist. It may have existed in the fertile mind of the member for Perth.

         The member for Perth said that there were contracts for a noise audit or a scoping study. Presumably these studies were going to lead to the compensation package that he was talking about. Was there a contract for the compensation package? Was that also on the then minister's desk? Although they were on the desk of the then Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), the writs had been issued for the federal election, which meant that these supposed contracts could not be signed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We are expected to believe that these contracts were there all the time. It is a bit like saying that the cheque is in the mail. In other words, it was a pre&amp;hyphen;election pork-barrel; it was a con. The Minister for Transport did not know when the federal election was going to be called, otherwise he would have been better prepared and had the contracts signed. I do not understand how the Minister for Transport, a member of the previous cabinet, did not know when the election was going to be called because almost everybody else in Australia knew when the election was going to be held.

        <para first-indent="16">
         If these studies were so urgent, so important, why did the former Labor government not act sooner? The member for Perth has been in government since 1993. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was the former member for Swan. He could have done something about it. What did they do? What did they do in 13 years of government? Nothing but tokenism on this issue.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Perth is incorrect in saying that there is one set of rules for Sydney and one for other places. In Sydney, compensation was awarded to people whose residences fell within the 40 ANEF contour band and the 30 ANEF contour band. Even though Senator Margetts also wanted people within the 20 ANEF contour to be compensated, thankfully commonsense has prevailed here. In Perth no residences fall within the 30-plus contour. The 30&amp;hyphen;plus footprints are found over industrial land, 35&amp;hyphen;plus over the airport's buffer zone and 40&amp;hyphen;plus over the airport.

         In Perth, Airservices Australia calculate the Australian noise exposure forecastâ€”the ANEFâ€”contours for the FAC. That is how we know what the contours or footprints are. Airservices Australia have microphones in place around the areas surrounding the airport, including residential areas, to measure the noise emanating from aircraft. A further acoustic study would only duplicate this.

         Airservices Australia continually run compliance studies to make sure aircraft are complying with their regulations and restrictions. These address the noise impact of flight paths.

Labor was thrown out of office because of its arrogance, and here we have a typical example of that arrogance in Ross Free. What is Ross free of? Ross is free of scruples. He is free of morality. He is free of conscience. He is free of ideas.

         â€”Tonight I rise in the House to speak on an injustice being perpetrated by this government and, indeed, aided and abetted by the opposition. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made all the right noises about a more democratic parliament in this place as the 38th Parliament gathered at the end of April. He has trumpeted the dramatic increase in the number of questions being asked. I can only say that I am glad I did not have to suffer the disgraceful question times of the former Labor governmentâ€”for most of those I have observed here serve precious little purpose and continue the grandstanding and theatrics that the public, in the galleries and through television, detest.

         The major point I want to make tonight is to highlight the total contempt with which the government and the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) regard the rights of the Independent members. We have been consistently asked to deal through the opposition whip when trying to access speaking lists. This is unacceptable. My fellow Independents and I are non-government members of this Houseâ€”we are not opposition. We will not be party to a speaking list convention that has no role in the democratic parliament. We are not only being asked to submit speaking requests to the opposition whip but also being asked to have them in a week ahead.

          â€”I have no relationship with the opposition, as is obvious, nor with the whip's offices of the Liberal, National or Labor parties. The constitution confers no exclusivity on political parties. In a letter from the Clerk of the House to the Independent member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) on 23 May, an explanation of procedures for Independents nominating for joint parliamentary committees was set out. In respect of those joint committees, an Independent member is able to make his or her nomination direct to

         Earlier today, Madam Deputy Speaker Sullivan used standing order 86 to effectively rule my colleague the Independent member for Curtin as disruptive and obstructing business. A motion of dissent to this ruling was eventually gagged by the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) who said, `Theyâ€”the Independentsâ€”can't be allowed to have their say too often.' This is typical of the arroganceâ€”this party political arroganceâ€”that the people of Australia were led to believe would be tempered by this new government and new Prime Minister.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Leader of the House told the House earlier today that `on any fair interpretation of standing order 86, the Independents are disruptive'. That is demonstrably untrue. I have sought only the democratic right to gain independent access to the speakers list on bills. The current compilation of the list is a convention. The parties and party whips are not recognised in the constitution. Standing orders are the rules of this House, and they are the rules I abide by.

         To have access to the opposition Labor Party list is unacceptable, unworkable and undemocratic. I accessed the Labor list onceâ€”for my first speechâ€”until I fully understood the system. There is a procedure in place for other speeches in this chamber where we deal with the Speaker to ascertain our speaking opportunities, according to a strict formula which he or she also applied during question time. It is under this system I am able to speak now. It is fair, and I accept it. Why, for democracy's sake, can this system not be adopted in debate on bills where the Speaker uses his or her discretion to inject us into the debate? We seek no more. By invoking standing order 86 today, Madam Deputy Speaker denied fair and democratic access to the non-party members in this House.

         The people of Calare gave me a strong vote in March based largely on my Independent stance and my determination to lift the standard of representational democracy.

         There must be an independent line to the speaking listâ€”that can only be through the Speaker or through the Chief Government Whip in consultation with the government, opposition and the Independents. There were five Independents elected to this House on 2 March. It is likely there will be another elected to the New South Wales parliament soon.

         â€”In supporting the Australian Animal Health Council (Live&amp;hyphen;stock Industries) Funding Bill 1996, I think what must be made clear is that it is putting another impost on Australian primary producers and I am concerned that we continually do this. We continually do this on the basis that we say we have their agreement. I am not at all sure that this is so. It is very clear if you look at the wool industry, which is in a crisis, that the Wool  Council does not represent the overwhelming view of growers. Yet the government and, for that matter, the opposition seem intent on backing this very small group and other noisy elements without any real consultation with the wool growers themselves. This is a situation that I believe has to be addressed.

        In addressing this bill, one cannot escape putting AQISâ€”the Australian Quarantine Inspection Serviceâ€”under some sort of scrutiny. For while it is true that a clean, green image is of great value to Australia, it is not at all clear that AQIS is in fact defending this. AQIS's job is, in my view, to make sure that Australia is kept as free as possible from the scourge of pests and diseases that exist overseas and do not exist in Australia.

        There seems to be an element within AQISâ€”I suspect it is an element at the very highest levelâ€”that is obsessed with a rationalist economic view of the world which says something along the lines of `It will be better when we have all the same diseases throughout the world, and then we can play on a truly level playing field.' In fact, I have heard this view espoused by senior people in DPIE, and I have no doubt that it infects the very senior levels of AQIS. I want to make it clear when I attack AQIS that I am not attacking the staff, many of whom do a dedicated job. I have had them complain to me recently about the lack of facilities and funds to do the job properly.

         The decisions made by AQIS in recent times seem to owe more to politics than they do to science. GATT has become God. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is held up by both parties as some sort of shining star of a level playing field and free world trade. It is, of course, nothing of the sort. It is interesting to note the actions of other countries who sign GATT agreements. They immediately go out and try to find a way around them. For example, in fairly recent times, the French, having signed a GATT agreement, were within a few weeks banning Norwegian fish on the grounds of health. I am sure those grounds were totally spurious, but I commend the French government for protecting its industries. I just wish that our own government and the former government could have had the same enthusiasm.

         I want to look at a few of the things we have had inflicted on us recently. I believe that the reason Canadian pork was allowed in, despite the real risk of some diseases, was the threat to our beef exports. The Canadians had simply said, `If you don't do this, we will cut your beef.' We sell beef to the worldâ€”a very corrupt marketâ€”on price or quality, and that is the basis upon which the Canadians buy it. After having signed the agreement, they suddenly cut our beef anyway. It was something they were always going to do. There is a lesson there, but it is a lesson that I doubt will be learned.

         Chicken meat is in the same category. There are diseases overseas that would be devastating if they arrived in Australia. Newcastle disease is one. Minister Anderson has said not to worry about newcastle disease, because it could be brought in on migratory birds. If it could be brought in on migratory birds, it would have been here long, long ago. The truth is, of course, that any migratory bird holding the disease at the contagious stage would die en route. It would not get here. The fact that it has never got here is an indication of that. That was a very naive statement by the minister.

         We have had the salmon debate. It is true that the last government did not allow the importation of salmon. One had the feeling it was inevitable and that things were moving in that direction, but the election saved it in the interim. I only hope that we will show a little more fortitude and not allow salmon products into Australia. This is not an economic argument in Australia, because our people are selling their salmon at a premium on world markets, against Canadian salmon. But, at the same time, we do not want people, such as Coles or Woolworths, importing dumped salmon and dropping it on the market here.

I thought he spoke very well on this issue. Canola seed has been drawn to my attention by several constituents. Canola seed was imported from New Zealand. I am not sure that it was a superior strain; I think it was simply a cheaper strain. My inquiries tend to indicate that the importerâ€”and, in fact, the agent for AQISâ€”WAQIS, the Western Australian government inspection service, knew that the seed contained foreign seeds or weed seeds, 12 in all, some of them very serious.

         Red shank is one seed and there is another plant there that has the potential to be a skeleton weed. It does not exist in Australia. It is called cleavers. Certainly it can cause a lot of trouble in Western Australia, not only because of the cost of eradication but also because of the damage it can cause due to the levels of insecticide that we would have to incur if that seed is to be eradicated. I believe the costs of eradication must lie with the Western Australian government and that eradication must be undertaken.

         The reverse scenario also occurs, of course. AQIS has done things that I am aware of. It has been counterproductive when Australian companies have sought to export animals overseas. Just a few years ago I had a fellow in Western Australia who had an order for goats, paid for by the American government, to go to the Ukraine. He was going to source them out of Meekatharra. In fact, they were going to be flown direct to the Ukraine in very large Russian transport planes. However, AQIS stepped in and said that it could not allow this unless every goat was ultrasound tested before departure to make sure it was not pregnant.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I thought this was absolutely absurd and I went to some trouble to find out a bit more. The AQIS people told me they were frightened of the Animal Welfare League and that they had had a case where goats had been shipped out of Sydney to Korea and they had experienced very high mortality rates en route. When I inquired amongst the trade I found out that what they had done was allow goats to be shipped out without grading for size. They had on the plane billygoats, young female goats and kids, and all in the same pens. The billygoats had trampled a lot of the young nannies and kids to death and as a result mayhem had ensued in Korea.

         I have a processor in my electorate who has really pioneered the export of Australian scallops at high prices. He has been very successful. His name is Jimmy Chung from Far West Scallopsâ€”I am sure he will not mind my mentioning his name. We now import cheaper Canadian scallops and export ours at a premium price. He tried to get Indonesian sourced prawns into Taiwan. Taiwan has a policy of importing fish product from only Australia or Japan. Japan exports far more fish product than it catches. It obviously reprocesses and that gives it a very big advantage.

We wanted to repack them with wording that went along the lines, `Indonesian prawns. Packed and processed in Australia. Guaranteed fit for human consumption in Australia.' That was a form of words which would have satisfied the Taiwanese, but you just simply could not get that through AQIS. It would not allow them to be branded as anything other than Indonesian prawns. That absolutely outrageous decision was upheld by the minister.

         There are lots of other examples. I saw in the paper the other day that Cannon Foods in Perthâ€”a very competent organisationâ€”is looking to export downstream processed Australian product. It had inquiries from Australian embassies to supply one of its chicken products. It wanted to supply those products to Australian embassies so that the embassies could use them as promotional food when they were entertaining people. This was banned again by AQIS. It was said that the small volume involved certainly in initial stages just could not be supported on the plans and the requirements that AQIS had.

        <para first-indent="16">
         It is quite clear that, if AQIS is going to have any relevance for Australia, it has to get back to its charter of protecting us from the import of pests and diseases. It also has to enhance the export of Australian product. In many cases, user pays is a fine catchphrase. But if the user has no say in what the standards and the requirements are, it really ends up as nothing less than extortion and an action by an Australian government entity in restraint of trade. AQIS's behaviour in this area can be documentedâ€”it is not good.

         It seems to me that we should be encouraging a lot more bilateral arrangements. For instance, if a Japanese producer is happy with a standard in Australiaâ€”and why would it not be happy, Japan imports stuff from Third World countries whose conditions are horrific when compared with oursâ€”then that is all that should be required. If that company is satisfied, that company can make its inspections as frequently as it likes and it can test the stuff on arrival. If that is what is required, then that is all that should be required in terms of exports. The government should clearly be facilitating trade, not in any way acting in restraint of it.

         People feel that when you have a body like AQIS that it is doing the job. But I would say that Australia has never been under greater threat from the arrival of diseases. With the advent of air travel, we can cross the world in a single day. With the advent of migration of large numbers from Third World countries, the threat has never been greater. The threat posed by migrants wanting to bring with them material from their homelands is a significant threat. We need to be stepping up our quarantine.

         Because this is something that affects the whole nation, it should not be charged just to exporters. To say `The user pays' is an absolute nonsense because, for instance, if foot&amp;hyphen;andmouth disease were to get established in the Murray Valley, it is estimated that it would take

The actions seem to be to downgrade quarantine regulations on incoming produce but to increase the requirements on stuff leaving the country. That certainly is illogical and irrational and it is something we have to address. If we do not address it, we are going to miss out on an enormous potential market that does exist in the world for downstream processed Australian food. I hope that the government will pay some attention to it, although the recent utterances of the minister indicate that this is unlikely.

         â€”I would like to pick up on some of the lines raised by my colleague opposite. In particular, I draw to the attention of the Main Committee and of my fellow Australians the discussions that are going on now in government circles concerning the Australian chicken meat industry and the prospect of imported chicken meat from the United States and Thailand. The previous government struggled with this issue for a lengthy period of time. The minister of the day, Senator Collins, was unable to make a decision but the indications were that he was willing to accept the risk of the import of processed chicken meat from Thailand. This has been a matter of real concern for the Australian chicken meat producing industry.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The problem is that in issues of this type there has to be some acknowledgment given that Australian producers will seek to protect their interests and their markets, and they will quite properly raise a variety of arguments to defend their position. The role of government in these circumstances is to determine whether the issues that the Australian producers raise are legitimate arguments or whether they are arguments raised purely to secure their own share of the market and prevent an attack from imports.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In this instance, I have endeavoured to examine the arguments of the industry and the arguments that government has consistently regurgitated, and those views are mainly the views of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. Both Senator Collins and to a lesser degree Mr Anderson have been captive to the views of AQIS. That is understandable because many ministers are reluctant to be courageous or adventurous in an area where they lack expertise, and they have paid servants who supposedly possess the expertise to advise them. And so around Australia I have noted, both in the Sydney and Melbourne regions in particular, a concern expressed by members of parliament representing the view of their chicken meat producers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In my endeavour to examine these matters I have attended meetings of expert veterinarians, of poultry experts who would be ranked as world authorities, who very much contest the view of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service that it is safe to import cooked chicken meat from Thailand. These veterinarians have written textbooks. One I call to mind is Tom Hungerford, an Australian name in the poultry industry and also one of very significant international standing. He, amongst others, says that the risk to the Australian poultry industry and Australian bird life is very great indeed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The unknown factors are these: we do not know the hygiene, conditions or protocols that will be applied to the preparation of cooked chicken meat by the country from which we are importing. That is so indefinite, so dangerous and so likely to be done in chicken producing

         areas that diseases will be brought into Australia. Those diseases will spread through the Australian flocks and into Australian bird life. One of the downsides in the predictions made by the avian veterinarians is that there is a chance that 80 per cent of the Australian parrot population could be wiped out, because parrots are evidently very susceptible to newcastle disease. This could mean the complete elimination of some species of parrot and the survival of others at only a 50 per cent rate, with the average wipe&amp;hyphen;out being about 80 per cent. I think that most Australians would reject risking that occurring.

        AQIS is relying on the work done by Alexander, back in 1988&amp;hyphen;89 or somewhere about that period, for a New Zealand firm. The extension of work carried out on egg yolks to the importation of chicken meat is a fairly tenuous link, but scientists are prepared to accept that newcastle disease can be killed under certain conditions, if a high enough temperature is applied for a sufficient length of time. That was the basis of Alexander's work done on egg yolks.

        As a nation, we appear to be very willing to put at risk not only the economic circumstances and benefit of Australian families but also our heritage in order to gain the short&amp;hyphen;term benefit of maybe trading in beef with certain areas around the world.

We have a unique population of native fauna, and it must be understandable to anybody around the world that we need to protect that fauna from imported disease.

        We also have an image that is green and clean for agricultural production, and that green and clean image is a great advantage to Australia in selling its commodities around the world. It is one of our strong marketing feats that we can claim that Australian production processes are minimally interfered with by disease and by the chemicals and treatments on which much of Europe and North America must rely in order to gain economic production. There would be nothing that would suit Australia's competitors more than having an outbreak of newcastle disease or fire blight in Australia to limit our economic capacity and also to limit the markets to which we could gain entry.

        Therefore, I put to the House the significance of the Senate inquiry that is currently taking place into the protocols for the import of chicken meat. I wish to encourage veterinarians and those with expertise, as well as those in the Australian industry and Australian conservationists who care for Australian fauna, to take a very active interest in that current inquiry and, if they have expertise that is relevant to the inquiry, to come forward. Australian conservationists seem to be more interested in the ozone layer than they are in the Australian parrot population. They seem to be much more interested in whether there is going to be an appropriate amount of ozone miles above the earth rather than in whether the very population that makes Australia unique for its birds and animals will be allowed to survive.

        I am amazed at the attitudes within the Australian Conservation Foundation. When I have written to them on this basis, there is either a failure to reply or a cursory telephone call. There is no real interest whatsoever in the things that, to me, matter as far as preservation of Australia's uniqueness and a real attitude of conservation go. They would rather get involved in chasing whales around the shores of Australia or in attending some esoteric conferenceâ€”paid for by government, usuallyâ€”where they discuss the ozone layer.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I think it is time that we dealt with the realities of conservation and exposed some of the so&amp;hyphen;called conservationists as mere theorists lacking any scientific expertise or any practical experience in the areas in which they proclaim themselves to be expert. It is time that we
        <break page="4230" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

       <para first-indent="16">
        Finally, I wish to place on record some of the comments that I am receiving from the ministerâ€”but drafted, no doubt, by AQISâ€”which outline the significance of Australia's international trading position, our dependence on international markets and the need for us to establish a process that is transparent, that is liberal and that recognises that we are gaining access to markets in Japan, California or the Philippines. It would seem to me that to compare access to Japan for Australian riceâ€”free of disease, of the highest quality and grown under conditions that cannot be emulated in Japanâ€”with the entry from a disease ridden area of a commodity that has real risk and difficulty attached to it is a false comparison.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That does not mean to say that trading nations such as Japan, the Philippines or the United States would see it with Australian eyes. I understand that because trade is a matter of self&amp;hyphen;interest; it is not always a matter where you can lay down rules of process that will be followed by the participants. There is a fair degree of self&amp;hyphen;interest amongst Californian fruit producers to see that Australian fruit does not get into their area, and I understand that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is not an argument that we are having about the import of processed chicken meat to Australia that steers away from self&amp;hyphen;interest. But I am raising today the fact that, if you put self&amp;hyphen;interest to one side, there is sufficient scientific basis for us to reject the import of chicken meat into Australia without reference to any of the matters of trade or protectionism, or the arguments that are often raised by Australian producers or processors.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The AQIS argument runs the international trade argument. And it is very important that the Australian government and the minister are active in markets such as the Philippines, Mexico and the United States and, in the APEC context, are pressing for improved market liberalisation. But we have always had a claim that there ought to be market liberalisation because both our cost of production and the quality of our production exceed that of most other nations. We are lower in the production cost, and we are higher in the quality and lower in the contamination of our food products in particular.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At the very time that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is launching our supermarket into Asia strategy, which is one of the great drives he has put together for us to be more effective in marketing into Asia, one of the most compelling arguments will be the lack of contamination and the high quality of our food products. So to mount the trade argument that we need to give away concessions which will ultimately run the risk of damaging that food quality seeks, in my opinion, to strike at the very basis of our most compelling and productive argument when we seek to trade with others.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The AQIS consideration of the whole of this newcastle disease debate has been that it is based on the work of Alexander and the extension of his work to apply to cooked chicken meat. In my opinion, AQIS has refused to consider the proper basis and the full gamut of the protocols, and has argued not only the trade argument but, in my view, a spurious consumer argument which says that the Australian consumer will benefit from cheaper chicken meat.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The exact benefit is about 30c per chicken imported into Australia, if they come as whole chickens. I think if it were put to the Australian people they would gladly pay that extra 30c per chicken in order to continue to eat clean Australian chicken and maintain the Australian parrot population. However, put that to one side.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The cost of cleaning up an outbreak of newcastle disease in Australiaâ€”if you can get it cleaned upâ€”is roughly estimated at $30 million. If you spread the advantage to the consumer
        <break page="4231" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         over a period of time it would be, say, $3 million a year over the 10&amp;hyphen;year period. So if there is one outbreak of newcastle disease in a 10&amp;hyphen;year period, all economic advantage is lost to the consumer, the Australian government and everybody else. The tenuous nature of what is being proposed here makes it impossible in pure business and logic terms, and I cannot see the political advantage either.

        I would like to point out to AQIS that there needs to be a new day and age, and a change in the way in which they do things. My colleague has argued his cases. I am arguing the chicken case. I will also bring up an instance where some of my constituents sought to export product to Japan. They got a phytosanitary certificate from AQIS which said they had a clean product, and it was proved on arrival in Japan that the product was not clean. So one must assume it may not have been inspected properly or may not have been inspected at all. When confronted by my constituent about whether this product was clean and whether it was inspected, AQIS said, `Our phytosanitary certificate is just one of the mechanisms used to gain export and entry.'

        The fact of the matter is that under the law of Australia you cannot send the stuff out without the certificate, and it is a law of Japan that they will not import it unless there is a government&amp;hyphen;issued phytosanitary certificate. AQIS is saying, `It does not matter much whether we have it or not. It is a bit of paper that travels with straw, hay, or whatever, and we are just not really concerned about the status of that certificate.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It would seem to me that, if we are going to build confidence in Australian exporters and with our clients overseas, the very first thing that AQIS must do is guarantee the quality of their certificates. And by guaranteeing the quality of their certificates I believe they will gain prestige for themselves, because nothing could be more significant for an Australian exporter to say than, `Here is an Australian government certificate that guarantees the quality of the product free from vegetable and animal contamination.'

        If it were to be proved that, inadvertently, the inspection had not been done effectively or that there was a dormant disease or an insect egg that incubated in the process of transport and sprang to life on arrival in Japan, and the product had to be dumped, set aside or fumigated or had to undergo some such process, then I would have thought that if AQIS wanted to establish a real integrity they would guarantee their decision and they would guarantee the replacement of any losses caused both to the exporter or the importer.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Surely that would be a very small guarantee, spread across a period of years, and is a very simple commercial device practised by practically everybody who wishes to maintain a consistent market.

        I am concerned about the prospect of imported chicken meat into Australia. I wish Senator Winston Crane well in his inquiry. I hope it is a very thorough and successful inquiry and that the Senate committee is able to draw on the full scientific expertise of Australia and overseas. I hope that they are able to examine very carefully the Alexander decision of 1988 on egg yolk and whether it can be extended to permit the import of chicken meat from Thailand. Above all, I encourage the minister and the department to maintain the clean, green image that Australian products have so much. It is our strongest selling point and something we must always maintain. I would also like to encourage AQIS to be proud enough of their organisation to be able to back their decisions and their certificates with guarantees that actually mean

         â€”Mr Deputy Speaker, it is not often that I rise on matters to do with primary industry or agriculture. A former Minister for Primary Industries, John Kerin, used to always ask me when I was going to get up and protect the interests of the farmers of Thomastown. Anybody who knows the suburb of Thomastown knows that the predominant employment there is industrial. But today I find I rise here to speak on behalf of two of the 207 persons employed in agriculture in Scullin. In doing so, I indicate that it is not only on behalf of those people that I speak. In those industrial areas of my electorate, we have many food processors and they are very keen to see that the green and clean image of Australia's food produce is protected. It is that downstream processing of primary industry that is, of course, very important to the overwhelming number of people of my electorate.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another reason that I find myself a bit bemused by the potential of my contribution in today's debate is that I agree nearly entirely with what the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) has said. This did have me a little worried but I have overcome that worry. I think that he outlined a very good case about the potential of decisions that might be made on the chicken meat industry.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The chicken industry in Australia employs around 62,000 people, both directly and indirectly. Many of these are smaller primary producers and are involved in many different stages of the production process. I have been approached, like many other members, by many chicken farmers concerned about the implication of the decision to allow imported cooked chicken meat on their livelihoods, on Australia's health and on our natural environment. I took the opportunity to visit one of these people who contacted me, who lives and works in my electorate. These people describe themselves as poultry farmers and I was very impressed by the quality of their operation. This farmer is one of the smaller primary producers. Each 10 to 12 weeks he receives about 25,000 day&amp;hyphen;old chicks from the chicken processing company he is contracted to. For eight to 10 weeks the chickens are housed in the two large sheds on the farm, with sophisticated heating, water and feed systems. The chickens are given a course of feed, which is supplied by the contracting company. The nutritional content of the feed alters with the age of the bird.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At the completion of the cycle, the chickens are returned to the company. The mortality rate among the chickens is low, only around three to four per cent of the birds. The sheds housing the birds are then thoroughly cleaned and there is a two&amp;hyphen;week break before the cycle begins again. The farmer receives payment for the batch of 25,000. It is not an enormous amount of money, after the farmer has deducted the cost of gas for heating, electricity and water. Water represents a large component of the cost.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The reality is that many of these smaller primary producers live pretty close to the edge with their running costs. Although these smaller primary producers run their own business, they are contracted to a chicken processing company and receive a set amount per bird for the cycle that the birds are in their care. Of course, it could be argued that they are in fact contracted employees of the chicken processing companies.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If cooked chicken meat is allowed to be imported, it is precisely these smaller primary producers who will be effectively locked out of the system. Rather than have contracts with many small farmers, the large chicken processing companies will undoubtedly prefer to deal with a chain of farms or with the big agribusiness farmers.
       </para>
       <break page="4233" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The chicken farmer in my electorate is not just concerned with the effects of imported chicken meat on his own business, he is genuinely concerned about the health implications of the decision and the potential environmental consequences. As has been indicated, there has been work undertaken by AQIS and, based on those studies, they have come to a position. I assert it is still necessary to make certain that the conditions surrounding the importation of cooked chicken meat are satisfactory by further investigation. There are too many horror stories for it to go ahead without being 100 per cent in the clear.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For instance, and not totally unrelated, there are the stories of the Brazilian chickens pumped so full of oestrogen to quicken their development that they began to affect the speed of development of the children who ate them. I agree with the honourable member for Mitchell that it is pleasing to see that the whole issue has been referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs Legislation Committee and I totally endorse the points of the honourable member for Mitchell in encouraging people to make submissions to that inquiry. I believe that in this instance an open public inquiry, such as can be conducted by the Senate committee, is appropriate. As the honourable member for Mitchell and others have said, we have to protect our image as an acclaimed producer in primary produce.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         An earlier experience I had with AQIS involved a chicken meat processor who operates in the suburb of Thomastown. The operator came to me with a problem in getting the proper certification of his works on the basis of the quality of the water that was being used. What was interesting about this tale was that this operator was using the same water supplied by Melbourne Water to the surrounding suburbs. This was water that was good enough to be used in a domestic sense by the surrounding suburbs and it fulfilled World Health Organisation standards for water but, given the very tight and conservative nature of the requirements of AQIS, it was not of sufficient standard to be used in the washing processes in a chicken processing plant.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The irony, I thought, was that this business was about to embark upon a niche market in Asia for chicken feet. The thing that was a stumbling block was the quality of water. In the end, the operator solved the problem by installing an ultraviolet filtration system to ensure that the standard of the water enabled him to get the certification.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In conclusion, we need to see that this position of allowing in cooked chicken meat is investigated thoroughly. It applies to a significant primary industry employing tens of thousands of Australians. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) has argued that Australia needs to do this in the interests of trade liberalisation to benefit our own farmers. However, trade liberalisation should not mean jeopardising our own standards or unnecessarily risking our own environment. Destroying the livelihoods of Australia's efficient small primary producers and those who depend on them is hardly good for our own economy.

         â€”It is interesting that the debate this morning so far has been relatively focused on the chicken industry but the bill does cover a number of other industries. Obviously previous speakers have taken a keen interest in that particular issue at the moment. It is quite topical as far as the importation of chicken meat is concerned.

        I was interested in the remarks from the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) with regard to an attitude that prevails within this government and the previous government towards international trade arrangements under GATT. I just highlight to the member for Kalgoorlie that there are a number of us who take the attitude that we are watching and seeing how beneficial it is. Whilst I personally acknowledge the philosophy behind trade liberalisation,
        <break page="4234" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the process in achieving the ultimate goal is not always equitable. Certainly at the moment there is anecdotal evidence that it is not equitable either. So on that basis I would probably disagree a little bit with the member for Kalgoorlie on that point.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other issue that has been commented on fairly generally this morning is with regard to the way we as a nation discharge our international responsibilities and how we treat the import&amp;hyphen;export arrangements and our bilateral trade arrangements. As far as the importation of the chicken meat is concerned, I am sure that as a nation exporting commodities and a lot of primary produce we are expected to go over much higher hurdles sometimes than what we impose on imports into this country. One of the previous speakers was talking about the export of rice. If we think of the process and the lengthy negotiations that this country has had to go through to be able to export rice to Japan, the restrictions that are put on us and the requirements that we must meet compared to other nations, certainly we see that the process and the progress of the development of world trade liberalisation is not equitable. I think that we should always bear that in mind when making decisions such as this with regard to the non&amp;hyphen;direct tariff/subsidy type arrangements with commodities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A number of the previous speakers have focused to a large extent on the chicken industry. I want to focus a little bit on a couple of our other primary industries that have associated and not totally unrelated problems at the moment. I know this bill is about protecting what we have got in this country. I suppose that when people in Australia go to the shop, to the supermarket or to the butcher's shop to buy beef, lamb or chicken, they just take for granted that it is in pristine condition, that we do not have any exotic diseases in Australia and that there is no fear of foot&amp;hyphen;and&amp;hyphen;mouth disease or mad cow disease and all the sorts of things that are evident in other countries. Generally, the population takes that too much for granted.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think that Australia's very good track record in this regard should be highlighted. Perhaps that record causes other nations to which we are trying to export to raise the bar, so to speak, and to try to slow us down. There are so many other nations around the world which do not have such a good track record on animal diseases.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We obviously support the bill before the Main Committee today. The purpose of this bill and the associated amendments to a number of primary industry levy acts is to direct funds to the Australian Animal Health Council Ltd. This will allow the beef, sheep meat, egg, chicken meat and pork industries to meet their funding obligations to the council. The Australian Animal Health Council Ltd has been established as a non&amp;hyphen;profit company and will be jointly owned and funded by the Commonwealth government, state and territory governments and the peak national representative bodies of Australia's livestock&amp;hyphen;based industries. Its mission will be to ensure that the Australian animal health service system is capable of maintaining acceptable national animal health standards which meet consumer needs and market requirements at home and overseas. That is described in the second reading speech, which also describes the structure of this body. Under `Remarks' in the bills digest it says:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        While the provisions of this bill are of a non controversial technical nature, the use of a non statutory corporation as a disbursement vehicle for public and private funds differs from the more traditional statutory disbursement vehicle in a number of respects, including:

       <para>
        Bear in mind, that this body is being funded by governments, both Commonwealth, and state and territory, and by industry. So there is a very broad range of public funds being applied in this exercise. As a member of the Public Accounts committeeâ€”and we are just reviewing the Audit Act and looking at a new Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's billâ€”I think that the parliament, generally, and the government should watch that the responsibilities of this organisation are dispersed when it is structured in such a manner. I am not saying that it is not an acceptable manner but, certainly, it is new as far as a statutory authority is concerned.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have had instances recently where different government departments have been less than prudent in their oversight of the expenditure of public funds. For instance, the future tech project, I understand, had many millions of dollars worth of taxpayers' and levy payers' funds and, to all intents and purposes, these were lost in that failed project. We should flag that. The minister and his department should monitor the process as it takes place once this organisation comes into effect.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Obviously, the whole exercise is about guarding and protecting Australian industries. The annual report from EXANDISâ€”the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Councilâ€”says that there are 54 animal diseases currently not present, but which could enter Australia and threaten our livestock industry. We all know what difficulties our primary industries are facing as far as exports are concerned and we certainly do not want to see the incursion of any of these diseases into Australia. They may jeopardise those very important domestic and export industries.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        EXANDIS goes on to say that the best known of the diseases with the most serious potential impact is foot&amp;hyphen;and&amp;hyphen;mouth disease. It has been prevalent in a lot of the countries overseas, some of which would like to break into some of the marketplaces that we currently occupy overseas. It is important from that perspective that we support and bolster the activities and the appropriations that are being outlined in this bill.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In its final annual report EXANDIS urged government and industry to maintain, through the AAHC Ltd, a high level of continued activity aimed at protecting Australia against exotic animal diseases and preparing for any outbreaks. EXANDIS considered that the greatest exotic animal disease threats to Australia are foot&amp;hyphen;and&amp;hyphen;mouth disease, newcastle disease, bluetongue and classical swine fever. As I say, we have heard a fair bit about newcastle disease here this morning.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The AAHC was born out of concerns that Australia might not be able to meet the demands of trading partners for information on animal health and welfare, unless a number of fundamental changes were made for the delivery of animal health services. The AAHC Ltd, is an unlisted public company, as I said. It was established following agreement in August 1995, by the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia. It is unique in its structure, in that it is a non&amp;hyphen;statutory corporation administering public and private funds. It differs from the more traditional industry and statutory bodies, such as AMLC and MRCâ€”and I want to make some comments on those couple of bodies shortly.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However, the advantage of this structure is that the AAHC is still accountable to its members, is more flexible in nature and is relatively cost&amp;hyphen;effective in its administration. As I said before, we should be monitoring its effectiveness and the way it is administered. There are a lot of public funds going to be applied to this body, and so it is important that we do that on the basis of the manner in which other statutory bodies have expended public funds
        <break page="4236" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         and discharged their responsibilities. They are bodies that have been under the direct scrutiny of the parliament and the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General.

       <para first-indent="16">
        With regard to an associated issue, with the current review that the minister and the department are undertaking with regard to the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, the MRC and the MIC, there has been a lot of public comment, particularly from the relevant industries that are involved. I have attended a number of public meetings, predominantly of beef producers in my electorate who are not satisfied with the way the AMLC and its associated bodies have discharged their responsibilities. The producers are not satisfied as levy payers, and this is associated with the issue that we are debating today, because the funds are coming in part from industry as well as from government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The producers in my area are not satisfied that the levies that they pay are being spent to the best advantage of the industry, and particularly of the producers. They are not satisfied that they have adequate representation on any of those bodies. They are in a minority, and the processing sector has the majority view from its end of the industry on all of those bodies. As I say, there has been an enormous amount of public comment as to what should be happening with the restructuring of those bodies. At this stage, I have not been convinced that we should not have two separate species bodies controlling sheep meats and beef meats and live cattle and live sheep.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe that there has been a conflict of interest within the AMLC, probably on a four&amp;hyphen;way basis, between the sheep industry, the beef industry, the processors and the producers. They are all mixed into the one melting pot together, all trying to achieve a goal. There is a great question mark now over whether generic marketing is the way to go, when you consider what some of the people that we trade against in the world marketplace are doing with their commodities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That raises the next question regarding getting some sort of agreement throughout the industry with regard to grading. It has been a bone of contention within the beef industry for a lot of years that there has never been agreement on a grading system. We are now getting to a stage as far as world competitiveness and access to markets are concerned where, unless the national industryâ€”and it will probably take leadership from the government, the department and the ministerâ€”agrees to decide on a universally accepted grading system, we are going to be continually put at a disadvantage in the marketplace.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In speaking in support of this bill, I have a couple of points to make in closing. We must continue to support this sort of monitoring. As I say, we probably take too much for granted in this country the fact that we benefit from living in a disease&amp;hyphen;free island nation. We do not have common borders with other countries where we can see diseases coming across those borders. We must continue to monitor, and it is very important that the government plays its role in industry as well. I highlight the fact again that, with this new structure for a limited company that is using government funds, public moneys and levies that are being applied to its exercise, we should monitor the way that it has gone. Maybe in the future there should be a report brought back with regard to how this particular structure has worked in this industry.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I take the opportunity to urge the minister to bring in the report while there is an end date to the review into the beef industry and to bring down his response to that as soon as possible. The beef industry is in crisis and the beef industry is looking for leadership. As far as I am concerned, I think there is leadership throughout the industry but at different levels. I think the beef industry is looking for some leadership and some direction from government. The
        <break page="4237" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         time is right to restructure those processes and statutory bodies so they better reflect what the industry wishes, they better reflect the producers in the industry and they better reflect the market in which we have got to operate internationally in the 1990s. With those few comments, I will finish there in support of the bill.

        The proposed amendments to these bills remove the retrospective application of the levies. As the bill stands, the levies will come into effect from 1 July 1996 on receiving royal assent. The amendments will ensure that the levies come into effect from the first day of the month at least 30 days after the act commences. A retrospective application of the levies and charges would disadvantage producers, levy payers and intermediaries who collect the levies on the Commonwealth's behalf. A retrospective application would also impose considerable additional cost on the levies management unit, the LMU, in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, in its attempts to recover the additional levies. The LMU is a cost recovery area, so costs incurred are passed on to industry and impact on the funding of the Australian Animal Health Council. Associated industry bodies, such as the promotional and research and development bodies, are also funded by these levies. It would have an adverse affect on those bodies.

        The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service recommended in June 1994 that cooked product should be admitted provided that it met certain strict conditions, including time and temperature parameters, which would inactivate disease agents of concern. In the consultation phase that followed, the effectiveness of the proposed time and temperature parameters as a minimum treatment against disease agents was agreed by a wide range of independent scientific authorities. It was also agreed by the Australian Poultry Industry Association and the National Poultry Association.

        AQIS advised the former minister, in the former administration, on 30 May 1995â€”and I stress that it was May of last yearâ€”that the technical assessments were complete and that access would be granted to the United States of America, Denmark and possibly Thailand. It is very important that that is on the public record and that it is reinforced: that the former minister in the previous administration agreed to those technical assessments that were complete on 30 May 1995. The previous minister noted this, without caveat, on 2 June last year. So it is hypocritical of those on the opposite side to come into this place and criticise this decision. It is a decision that was supported from the other side.

         â€”Following the incompetent approach of the previous administration, which is its legacy, Minister Anderson has engaged in extensive discussions with industry. All honourable members should acknowledge that the coalition government has established two working groupsâ€”one on the establishment of imported protocols and one on any economic and adjustment effects arising from the importation of cooked chicken meat. These groups were established with the full involvement of industry. A major industry and government meeting was convened at the minister's instruction and chaired by the minister in June this year. It must be acknowledged that the government is undertaking an exhaustive effort to address matters raised by the domestic chicken and chicken meat industries.

         â€”I am relating it, Mr Deputy Speaker, to a general observation I am making about the fact that, if you go to the second reading speech in relation to this bill, you will see that the amendments being made here relate partly to the quarantine service. I think that the quarantine service has food inspection issues related to it, so I will make some observations on it anyway.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        All I am saying to the minister is that the rolling changes that have been made to all these pieces of agricultural legislation are simply that. They were in process. The government has simply continued what we set going, and in fact it has been supported by us for exactly the same reasons. I just made the point that I thought he was a bit unkind, that is all, for those reasons.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Everybody seems to be wandering around with some confusion over those observations I made about quarantine. My briefing notes here tell me that the purpose of this bill is to make amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act, the Fisheries Management Act, the Farm Household Support Act, the Imported Food Control Act and the Quarantine Act. That is what they tell me. They are the government's own notes that came to us, so I do not know why the minister is confused about it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To move on from there, I have to say to the minister that I was enjoying his discomfort about the issue of imported chicken meat, having heard the sorts of things he wandered around Australia saying and noting that he is now simply picking up and moving on with exactly what was in process.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I will set the minister a challenge. I remember John Kerin telling me once, when we came to office in 1983, that something like 125 or 150 was the number for the minutiae of agriculture bills which had been created by the old Liberal&amp;hyphen;National Party administration, as it tried to legislate for every specific farm activity you could possibly find. With a whole lot of effort over a number of years, we have probably managed to get it down to about 75â€”I do not know. There is a challenge for the minister. For as long as his party is the government he should see if he can remove some of this for us. He should see if he can get this down to maybe a handful of sensible pieces of legislation, instead of all these levies, laying acts and heaven knows what.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I note that one of the amendments being introduced in the legislation is to ensure that drought relief payments are payable to eligible farmers only within the period specified on the drought exceptional circumstances certificate. I can only assume that it has been necessary to do that because we have been having payments outside the exceptional circumstances certificate. I do not know why that would be so, but if it has to be, it has to be. If it means that we are tightening up drought relief, then I am sure that the honourable minister opposite (Mr Bruce Scott) will be able to go round and explain to his constituency why we are having to do that. If it has to be, I am glad that it is.
       </para>
       <break page="4243" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         You will also note in the second reading speech that one of the amendments will allow quarantine officers of the various state and territory departments to be involved in the inspection of food imported into Australia. I think that it is important to make this point because there is certainly a perception conveyed in regional Australia that Australian producers and processors face great barriers when attempting to export food products into other countries. They will constantly tell you that you can bring anything into Australia where we do not have the same situation. I am sure that the honourable minister opposite has been one of the ones wandering around Australia saying that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact is that foods imported into Australia face significant testing and quality control processes and it is a nonsensical claim to say otherwise. I hope that the new government will take some steps to make it clear that not only are foods imported into Australia subject to inspection and quality assessment issues but also more resources are being made available to ensure that happens, because we hear a lot about unlevel playing fields.

There was a meetingâ€”I think in Bathurstâ€”where the former Prime Minister and a range of industry leaders in food processing, the farm sector and the transport sector looked at what things were required to bring this all together and really explore the food bowls for Asia concept. The document that was released from there had an action plan with a whole lot of key points. I was reading the other day the release from the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) announcing all these new initiatives. Every one of those key points was there and I thought, `Ah, isn't that wonderful?' This was what led me earlier to make the observation that I thought the minister was being a bit unkind. I am perfectly happy to say that I am glad to see the new government picking up these things, maintaining the consistency and running them through. But it would not hurt the new government to acknowledge that there is a process here and, where we have a bit of bipartisanship, we ought to be promoting that in the general community.

         â€”When enacted, the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 will be an omnibus bill. It will address areas of agriculture and provide amendments to acts from as diverse a spread as veterinary science, regulatory adjustment to fisheries, quarantine, household farm support and food control. Similarly, it will repeal 15 inoperative acts which, following a departmental review by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, are acts that were either superseded or which were intended to have effect for only a certain period of time, which has now expired.

         As the member for Patersonâ€”an electorate of over 9,000 square kilometres possessing some of the most productive grazing land and agricultural output in Australia through its predominance in beef, dairy produce, timber, seafood, poultry, vegetable produce and, of course, not forgetting the very much adjacent world&amp;hyphen;class wineries of the Hunter Regionâ€”I will be getting right behind and supporting any legislative change that improves the lot of the primary industry sector. With the people of Paterson very much steeped and enriched with primary sector pursuits, it is important to highlight how the wave of the legislatory wand in the House can be applied to deliver an agri&amp;hyphen;industry that will put more and better quality food on a nation's table and, more importantly, deliver valuable export dollars that enhance the nation's accounts.

         To build on one of the great religious stories, it would be fair to say that my region can and does deliver both the fishes and the loaves.

         As the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) has just announced, the Howard government is determined to realise the multimillion dollar potential of our marine resources. By the year 2020, the nation's marine resources are expected to generate many extra hundreds of millions of dollars in annual turnover. It is a phenomenal figure. But when you break down the reality of pressing overseas demand for our clean and outstanding fish and seafood, the access to maritime resources over an area almost twice as large as our island continent itself and the real initiatives promoted by the supermarket to Asia and the world strategy of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), it is not hard to see that vision and hard work can and will reach this astronomical trading performance inside two decades.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under this legislation, the Howard government, in implementing an amendment to the former government's Fishery Management Act 1991, is directly reacting to the requests of the fishing industry, which has called for amendments following the outcome of several court cases that have related to fisheries, and other areas of concern relating to property rights and the examination of effects of the current provisions of an act on the level of security for statutory fishing rights.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Fisheries Management Act provides for the issue of statutory fishing rights under fishery management plans. These rights are created by statute. In other words, rights created by statute can be withdrawn by statute without necessarily requiring the payment of compensation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The current reality provides that no compensation is payable because the fishing right is cancelled, ceases to have effect or ceases to apply to an individual fishery. The amendment seeks to clarify that, where there is an acquisition of property within the meaning of the constitution. Some recent court decisions in this very area have raised the question of circumstances where application of the provision may be contrary to paragraph 51(xxxi) of the federal constitution and therefore deemed invalid.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The point of the act is, as it presently standsâ€”and I am sure it was intendedâ€”that it was never meant to be an unfair and unconscionable piece of legislation. Yet the legal reality is that fishing rights can be cancelled in writing without any consideration of the cost or impost to the actual licensee.

         In many cases these are individual fishermen, individual small enterprises and hardworking people who do not need another slug from government. The Howard government is determined to stick to the key priorities, one of which is getting the monkey and the government off the

I would think it most untenable to the representatives of the local fishing and seafood industry that embraces Paterson electorate and, of course, the entire Australian seaboard.

         Another key amendment in this legislation is the amendment to the Imported Food Control Act 1992. Even if you are not an avid reader of the newspaper, or aware of Australian trade policy, I am sure the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and its role in the quarantine of imported foodâ€”in the interests of human healthâ€”would get a gentle nod from many people. AQIS has been put through the wringer in recent times. The Nairn inquiry will, in due course, address and assess its overall operation, its effectiveness and its ability to play the role of border guard, or the nation's doorman, in order to halt the introduction of exotics and noxious diseases.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The substantial amount of food which is imported into the country has a quarantine status. Inspection teams from the various state and territory departments of agriculture and the imported food inspection program of AQIS perform this role. The anomaly of the current Imported Food Control Act 1992 is that it only allows officers of AQIS to be appointed as authorised officers to inspect imported food, even though a fully equipped quarantine officer may carry out an inspection of the same food. The proposed amendment simply puts right a glaring problem in the current act. It is a critical problem and on the national scale of importance a problem that must be effectively addressed.

         Governments around the world may be wanting to drag down the tariff walls, to take a sledgehammer to unnecessary and overburdensome protectionism in keynote industries, but the wall that should never be diminishedâ€”indeed only strengthenedâ€”is the wall that has been put up to protect Australia from exotic diseases and the importation of noxious plants, insects and wildlife. The former Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Councilâ€”EXANDISâ€”outlined in its final report that the greatest threat to Australia is considered to be exotic and highly virulent diseases imported via the backs of migrating birds, on the plastic wrapping of imported products, and in illegally imported products.

         As I said, AQIS is being given a hard time at the moment, and the inadvertent outbreak of the rabbit calicivirus, the pilchard killings off south&amp;hyphen;east Australia and the papaya fruit fly outbreak has not enhanced its cause. However, any legislative clout that gives AQIS a more effective and efficient inspection service, that minimises unnecessary duplication of services and frees up resources to fight the fight against disease where it needs it the most has to be a step in the right direction. It should be acknowledged that this proposed amendment has been discussed with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), and representatives of the imported food sector and has received a thumbs up all around.

         Under current arrangements, it is not always cost-effective to prosecute passengers and inbound tourists breaching quarantine regulations at Australia's international airports, particularly in cases of less serious breaches. The proposed amendment tied to this legislation in relation to the Quarantine Act 1908 is a practical means of serving penalty noticesâ€”in other words, on&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;spot finesâ€”on people detected leaving an airport or port in Australia with undeclared quarantine goods in their possession. This initiative will free up forever our overstretched court system whilst not neglecting the serious breaches against quarantine that occur.

I understand that this particular breed of snail grows to an astronomical size and, if undetected and let loose on native flora, could have wreaked all sorts of damage. The government is not shirking its task in saying that the quarantine breaches are not serious. On the contrary, introducing a system of penalty notices, or opting for a court hearing for minor breaches, provides cost&amp;hyphen;effectiveness in obtaining compliance with our strict quarantine requirements and, importantly, enhances public awareness of the requirements which escape so many people, from our man with his giant snail in his suitcase to many more.

          There is another pleasing feature of the legislation, and it should please the people of regional and rural Australia who have done it tough in the past decade and a little bit longer.

          The amendments to the Farm Household Support Act 1992 will strengthen the arrangements that apply to the drought relief payment by clarifying the period of validity for drought exceptional circumstances certificates for the purpose of obtaining drought relief payments.

These certificates are issued on a six&amp;hyphen;monthly basis.

          The general outline of the legislation also amends the Farm Household Support Act 1992 by exempting income tests applicable to drought relief payments on any proceeds derived from the forced disposal of livestock. Under current arrangements by the former government, farmers receiving drought relief payments who are forced to dispose of their livestockâ€”a tragic occurrence during times of droughtâ€”are assessed by the Department of Social Security under the DRO test. This is the test that is used as the basis for the estimation of annual income, and it is used to set the rate of the drought relief payment for the next six months.

The amendment will exempt from income tests the people of Gloucester, Dungog, Stroud, Bulahdelahâ€”and indeed, my colleague for Lyne (Mr Vaile), the seat north of mineâ€”who depend on livestock for their income and survival and who, in tight times, need the drought relief payments to get through. This amendment will ease it for them.

           Our government, the Howard government, is absolutely committed to regional and rural Australia. We are determined to make sure that we provide fair and equitable relief to the people in the country. We have to forget all the Labor rhetoric that says that we are cutting services and cutting the guts out from under people in regional and rural Australia. How wrong they are.

           With an improved economy, lower interest rates and support for small businessesâ€”and one thing that Labor has forgotten is that farms are indeed small businessesâ€”we are fully supportive of rural and regional Australia. We fully support, too, families in country areas and their need for increased access to things like Medicare. I point out that this is one of the reasons that the Liberal Party holds 31 seats in regional and rural Australia. Indeed, my National Party colleagues hold 18 seats, and the Labor Party, at best, could scratch up two seats. We will accept Tasmania there as a seat. I fully support the bill and I commend the bill to the people.

        He also touched on the importance to this nation of a good quarantine inspection regime. I know that is an issue that goes to the heart of many Australians, because ours is an island nation and we ought to make sure that we continue to have a very strong quarantine inspection service in this country. The amendments in this bill will make sure that we have not only an effective service but also a more efficient one. The points raised by the member for Paterson clearly indicate that there are still many people who would like to bring into this nation products which would put at risk the great agricultural industries of this nation. Of course, diseases could afflict not only the agricultural industries but also the jobs that are generated as a result of the very successful agricultural industries which we have in this nation.

        I would like to make a few points on the amendment of the Farm Household Support Act 1992. The amendments will correct an anomaly in the existing legislation governing the payment of drought relief payments. This was certainly adequately and very eloquently pointed out by the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin).
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At present, for the purposes of drought relief payment, if a farmer is forced to dispose of livestock due to extreme drought conditions, the proceeds from the forced sale are treated as income for the year in which they are received, while in subsequent years they are treated as an asset. This means the proceeds are assessed under the income test for the drought relief payment. The effect of this treatment is that a farmer may be excluded from assistance under the drought relief payment or have his or her entitlement reduced.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Following this amendment, all proceeds from the forced disposal of livestock will be excluded from the income test for the purpose of the drought relief payment. This is not only sensible but is a very necessary amendment to the drought relief payment under the Farm Household Support Act 1992.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are many producers who, through extreme drought, have sold off their livestock and have been denied access to drought relief payments. It is important to point out to the committee that the drought relief payment is really an emergency relief payment that is to bring essential food and clothing items into families. There are those who had livestock in the past and had to sell them, through no fault of their own, through the circumstances of the drought, and were denied this. I know this is going to be welcomed by the farming community.

        The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 is a very simple bill. It proposes just one amendment to the principal act. That amendment is to section 20 and it ensures that the act continues to apply for a further two years until 1 January 1999.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Section 20 of the principal act, the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991, is a sunset clause. It currently provides that the act ceases to have effect on 1 January 1997. This bill proposes changing that date to 1 January 1999. Extensive national industry consultations have indicated widespread support for this two&amp;hyphen;year extension of the act.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The principal act provides assurances of education quality and financial protection to international students studying in Australia. It does so by registering providers of international education and training, based on state or territory approval and accreditation, and by imposing financial conditions on private education providers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The principal act was introduced in 1991 to meet three main objectives, namely: to ensure that international students in Australia are treated with equity and fairness; to provide a positive basis for promoting Australia's international reputation as a provider of reliable high quality education and training; and to ensure that taxpayers' funds are not required to recompense international students who may have been let down by individual education and training providers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These objectives remain relevant. This is not just the government's view, but the universal view of industry representatives expressed in recent national consultations by an independent consultant. This is an industry which currently earns Australia $1.9 billion in export revenue annually. It warrants proper protection and this bill allows that protection to continue.
       </para>
       <break page="4250" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The act has included a sunset clause since its making in 1991. The original provision was for a three&amp;hyphen;year sunset period. This was to allow development of complementary state and territory regulation and to ensure that the regulation of many small and medium sized businesses did not continue without review.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Unfortunately, states and territories have still not implemented legislation which would allow withdrawal of this act. Following review and extensive debate, the act was strengthened in 1993 and the sunset date was extended by another three years to the current 1 January 1997. Part of this extensive debate was consideration by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, which has now contributed to consideration of this act on several occasions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Consistent with the government's push to limit unnecessary business regulation, it is appropriate to retain a sunset clause in this act. The bill before the Main Committee seeks to extend the sunset date by only two years because this is considered sufficient time to allow further industry consultations and to develop simpler but still effective regulation in this industry. In particular, when the government has had the opportunity to fully consider the report of the current review, it expects to be able to bring forward further amendments to streamline this legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The industry is an important and valuable one for Australia. It is a major part of our growth in the export of services, bringing many intangible benefits, including the development of contacts for future trade and diplomatic links, in addition to the $1.9 billion in export revenue annually. This industry deserves continuing protection. This bill is an important part of such protection. I commend the bill to the Main Committee.

It extends the existing legislation for a further two years to ensure that there is a degree of financial and quality assurance in the provision of education services to overseas students.

        This legislation was introduced in response to a situation that developed at the beginning of this decade with regard to the credibility of much that was on offer from the non&amp;hyphen;formal parts of Australia's education and training system; that is, not including the universities, the schools and the TAFE colleges, but the other providers. Some major questions emerged as to the financial viability and the quality of the courses offered by many of those institutions. I think it was universally accepted that a proper regulatory framework had to be put in place and that led to the introduction of this ESOS Act. As has been indicated by Mr Abbott, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, it has been looked at a number of times since and the original sunset clause has been extended.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Clearly, it is vitally important that we do this to protect what is now a very substantial export industry. There is no doubt that the success of that industry is very sensitive to the credibility and the reputation for quality of what is provided by Australian providers of education and training services, and that has to be protected.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The precise nature of the regulatory framework is a matter that one can debate. The previous government initiated a review, carried out by Ernst and Young, of the operation of the legislation. That review involved very extensive consultations with all the stakeholders,
        <break page="4251" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         including the industry and the various tiers of government. I do not think there is any great dissent from the broad thrust of what emerged from that review.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The review canvassed a number of possible regulatory models, including the Commonwealth having the predominant role, or giving it to the states and territories, or having some sort of self&amp;hyphen;regulatory arrangement with the industry. There was something approaching unanimity, I gather, that the right approach would be a cooperative regulatory scheme involving the Commonwealth and state and territory governments together with the industry. There was no great dissent from that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The review also recommended the extension of the sunset clause for the existing legislation for a further two years. That is what the legislation we are dealing with today does, the idea being to provide a further period to enable the development of a more streamlined and simplified scheme of regulation. The opposition has no problem with that whatsoever, so that is all I will say.

         â€”Following the collapse in the late 1980s of several private education providers who had offered services to overseas studentsâ€”particularly from the Republic of Chinaâ€”and who had accepted a deposit payment of full fees, the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act was passed in 1991. Specifically, the government was forced to refund the fees of more than 12,000 international students in 1989 who were affected by the closure of private educational services.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Obviously this was embarrassing for everyone concerned and the principal bill was an attempt to ensure that this situation was not repeated. The principal act has since successfully given greater protection for overseas students, principally through the provision that education providers be registered, and fees paid by overseas students be placed into trust funds that may only be accessed in accordance with the regulations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Section 20 of the act provides a sunset clause up to the beginning of January 1997. The purpose of this bill is to extend this sunset clause to 1 January 1999. The government has stated that, in this time, it is hoped that the industry will, in consultation with the government, be able to develop simpler and more effective self&amp;hyphen;regulation. These are necessary and somewhat inevitable developments within an industry still in the maturing process. Australia's history in the overseas higher education sector began in the 1950s with Australia becoming an active participant in the Colombo Plan. This country initially provided 150 scholarships to students mainly from Commonwealth countries, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Beginning with the University of Melbourne, Monash University and the University of New South Wales, strategies were developed in the 1960s for universities to become more accessible to overseas students. In 1969, these initiatives culminated in the Australian vice&amp;hyphen;chancellors forming the Australian&amp;hyphen;Asian universities cooperation scheme to strengthen research and teaching exchanges with foreign higher education facilities. After a further series of debates about the future of higher education provision during the 1970s and early 1980s, the Jackson report in 1984 concluded that the internationalisation of Australia's higher education should be encouraged.
       </para>

        This groundbreaking report stated that the higher education sector in this country needed to be more accessible for overseas students because `discouraging the entry of foreign students harms Australia's foreign relations, deprives the community of cultural contacts, and neglects a potential source of export earnings'. By 1988, every Australian education sector was aggressively competing for overseas students and, after some initial hiccups, consumer

        I take this opportunity to inform the committee of the many benefits, apart from the immediate moneys received from fees, that overseas students bring to Australia, benefits which will only be enhanced as this industry develops, grows and matures. As I have already said, following the recommendations of the 1984 Jackson report, education facilities in Australia opened their doors to overseas fee paying students. Since 1986, the number of fee paying students in Australia has increased from 2,000 to around 81,000 in 1995. By far the greatest increase has come from the Asian region. Of the 70,000 students in 1994, 55,000 came from Asia. In 1994, 16.5 per cent of overseas students came from the People's Republic of China; 11.9 per cent, from Malaysia; 10.7 per cent, from Indonesia; and a further 9.5 per cent, from Hong Kong.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        From a negligible amount of revenue received from fees from overseas students, the figure has grown and now stands at between $300 million and $400 million per year. Estimates for total net expenditure of overseas students in 1991&amp;hyphen;92 in Australia ranged from $800 million to $1.2 billion per year. The total spending in 1994 of overseas students on course fees and stationery items alone amounted to well over $700 million.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Overseas students also, according to the Bureau of Immigration, Multicultural and Population Research, increase the aggregate demand for labour here in Australia by between 0.4 and 0.7 per cent. This so&amp;hyphen;called `quasi export income' results from the expenditure of overseas students on locally produced goods and services. I might add at this stage that overseas students do not displace Australian students, nor are they subsidised. Unlike in the mid&amp;hyphen;1980s, the overseas student industry has become trade rather than aid.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the 1992 survey of international students, it was estimated that the average overseas student spends about $422 per week whilst in Australia. This can only be good for small business everywhere. The average student from Japan spends 48 weeks of the year in Australia studying, spending an annual total of $26,683. Apart from the education expenditure that overseas students outlay on other goods and services whilst here in Australia, they pay taxes and contribute to research and teaching and the internationalisation of business and training; they encourage future trade opportunities; they add to the cultural, social and political tapestry; they benefit post&amp;hyphen;study immigration; and, importantly, they promote tourism by their friends and families, not only for the time that they are here but for many years after.

        Overseas students do not harm local employment. Even if working rights are granted to overseas students, there remains a substantial net gain to local employment. The effect on employment levels within the higher education sector has naturally been the most dramatic, both in regards to academics and their support staff. There has been a fivefold increase over the period 1989 to 1995 of staff employed as a direct result of the presence of overseas students.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The presence of foreign students in our educational facilities also enables the higher education sector in Australia to be more effective in an increasingly international environment. Whilst rapid increases in technology, such as the Internet, have ensured a vigorous exchange of ideas and dialogue between students in different countries, nothing will ever compare with the physical exchange of students and the enriching experience they gain from spending study and recreational time in other countries.

         In a world where most industries are evolving a more international focus, the interaction of Australian and international students can only be seen as a good thing. In the fields of medicine, engineering, economics and development, to name just a few, the personal relationships begun here in Australia often lead to healthy and beneficial relationships of a business and humanitarian nature in the future. This promotes understanding, tolerance and mutual respect. Many of those studying here will become the leaders of tomorrow, especially in the Asian region. It benefits our objectives and national interests to understand and be better understood.

         But we cannot underestimate just how competitive this industry is. America leads the way with 400,000 overseas students, followed by France with 125,000. Germany and Australia are roughly on equal terms with about 80,000 students. In recent years both Germany and France have attempted to restrict the future of growth in overseas student numbers, thereby presenting to Australia an opportunity to increase its share in this expanding market. Japan, however, has recently indicated its commitment to internationalising education and has plans for 100,000 students by the turn of the century. Australia therefore has to remain committed to providing quality education that guarantees that overseas students get what they paid for. This bill will go a long way in ensuring that this happens.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In detail, the principal bill requires accreditation for both the courses and institutions, which must remain proper in their recruitment of overseas students and must maintain notified trust accounts to be audited by DEETYA. The education providers must deposit all prepaid course money, refund fees if the institution closes and provide alternative arrangements in such a case.

         This act goes a long way in consolidating this relationship and coordinating private and public sector ambitions in the area of higher education provision to overseas students in the immediate future.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In conclusion, the ongoing protection for overseas students is a vital component to Australia remaining a popular choice for students, especially in the South&amp;hyphen;East Asia region. The international competition between Australia and North America will only increase in the future and it is important that these safeguards remain until the industry is mature enough for self&amp;hyphen;regulation and stability. The extension of the act's sunset clause is a judicious decision until this time. I commend the bill to the Main Committee.

         â€”I rise to support the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996, the main intent of which is to postpone the sunset clause in the principal act from having effect until 1 January 1999. The principal legislation was enacted following
         <break page="4254" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          disturbing events involving overseas students who had paid up&amp;hyphen;front fees for training courses and were left in the lurch when private providers failed to honour their obligations.

        The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991 sought to achieve three main objectives: to ensure international students in Australia were fairly treated; to ensure Australia maintained its international reputation as a reliable provider of high quality education and training; and to ensure that Australian taxpayers were not again required to compensate for broken commitments of service providers. In short, the act provided an essential framework of protection for overseas students studying in Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is unfortunate that, since the passage of the Commonwealth act several years ago, complementary legislation has not been enacted in the states and territories. Consequently, the federal government has found it necessary to extend the sunset clause provision. In Queensland's case, it is a glaring indictment of the former Goss Labor government that it procrastinated and neglected this relatively simple task for years. I am glad to see that the current Queensland Minister for Education, Mr Bob Quinn, is taking the appropriate steps to alleviate this problem.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The extension of the sunset clause provision will enable governments, in consultation with industry, to devise a coherent regulatory scheme that will provide effective protection to overseas students. The legislation will also be in keeping with the federal government's initiatives against unnecessary red tape that needlessly hampers this industry.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The importance of this task should not be underestimated. The provision of education and training services to fee&amp;hyphen;paying overseas students has been one of the quiet success stories of recent times, the magnitude of which still goes largely unrecognised. Australia's reputation in these overseas countries has been a pivotal element in Australia's past success, and is essential to the future expansion of the industry. In many ways it is astonishing to realise that, from its beginnings as a foreign aid scheme under the Colombo Plan, the provision of educational services to overseas students by Australian institutions and other providers has transformed into an industry which now earns Australia $1.9 billion annually.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The magnitude of this industryâ€”for that is what it isâ€”cannot be underestimated when institutions such as the University of Queensland can claim to be amongst Australia's top 500 exporters. The University of Queensland aims to have international students constituting five per cent of all enrolments, and when one looks at the facts it is not hard to see why this is a desirable outcome.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It has to be remembered that overseas students are enrolled over and above the course quotas for Australian students. They do not deny any Australian student a place at university. In purely economic terms, overseas students contribute enormously both to the economy and to the particular institutions they attend. The course fees paid contribute direct income to universities which decreases their reliance on government funding and helps the universities to stand on their own feet in this tight fiscal climate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1994 fee&amp;hyphen;paying undergraduate students from overseas comprised 2.3 per cent of the total undergraduate enrolments at the University of Queensland, but they contributed $6.6 million in income. Fee&amp;hyphen;paying postgraduate students comprised 10.6 per cent of total postgraduate enrolments and contributed $8.1 million. Universities are not, however, the sole providers of educational services in this country.

         A prime example of a training provider set to earn export income for Australia is the Queensland Racing Industry Training Centre. The centre will be based in my electorate of Lilley and, as the federal member, I have a keen interest in its success. Lilley has the benefit of being the undisputed racing capital of Queensland. Within Lilley's boundaries fall most of south&amp;hyphen;east Queensland's major race tracks, including Eagle Farm, Doomben, Albion Park and the Deagon training track.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Almost 1,000 thoroughbred horses are trained in the electorate, and the suburbs of Hendra, Hamilton and Ascot provide the traditional base for the stabling of horses in south&amp;hyphen;east Queensland. The Queensland Turf Club at Eagle Farm and the Brisbane Turf Club at Doomben have a total membership of about 4,000 people. Consequently, it is fair to say that the success of the Queensland Racing Industry Training Centre is of vital importance to the economic wellbeing of Lilley.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Queensland Racing Industry Training Centre's one&amp;hyphen;year course is specifically designed for international students who want a career in the Australian racing and breeding industry. Students will study in Brisbane and at the University of Queensland's Gatton campus. While the course is nationally accredited, it is only available in Queensland. Features of the course include a specially designed English language program. Opportunities to specialise in specific areas of the racing industry, such as track riding, race riding and stud management, are also available. Students will exit the course with a vocational certificate at ASF level II.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The importance of the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill cannot be underestimated in the case of the Queensland Racing Industry Training Centre. The first intake of 56 Japanese students in January this year has been very successful. These students have already contributed almost $2 million to our economy, by way of fees and accommodation, and they help reduce the cost of the training to our own students.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill should assist the Queensland Racing Industry Training Centre to market its courses in Asia and future students will be excellent advocates for promoting our racing industry. It is estimated that within the next five to 10 years at least 10 new racetracks will be open in China alone. This will require the purchase of more than 10,000 horses and expanded infrastructure in a country with no racing expertise. We therefore have the opportunity to educate people who will eventually become influential in the South&amp;hyphen;East Asian, Chinese and Japanese racing industries. This strong network can only benefit the Australian industry in terms of racing, breeding and tourism. Already, 50 per cent of the students are indicating they would like to study advanced courses in Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, the development of our integrated racing training complex in south&amp;hyphen;east Queensland, with the support of the Queensland Racing Industry Training Centre, would be an excellent platform for the Australian racing industry to seek further markets in South&amp;hyphen;East Asia. I have no hesitation in supporting the bill, as the importance of our engagement with overseas students should be fostered and, above all, their interests protected. Through this interaction, the educational lives of both Australians and overseas students may be enriched and Australia may earn significant export dollars in return.

       (1) Yes, I have received a copy of SST6 from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). This public ruling is not a change of Government policy. The ATO in conjunction with professional bodies and taxpayer representatives has developed a comprehensive ruling to assist taxpayers to determine the taxable value of the goods they sell. The ruling deals with and provides solutions for issues affecting the calculation of taxable value of goods which is a major building block in the sales tax law. The ruling seeks to assist taxpayers by explaining the practical application of Government policy.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       Next to the difficulties experienced in correctly classifying goods for sales tax purposes, determining the taxable value of goods is the most common and time consuming problem faced by both the ATO and taxpayers. For this reason publishing a public taxation ruling on taxable value was considered to be of some priority by the ATO, sales tax practitioners and large corporate taxpayers.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (2) This ruling is the result of intensive negotiations over the last 2 years with sales tax professional bodies, industry bodies and the ATO. It provides certainty and consistency through the use of Safe Harbours that can be adopted by taxpayers. These are practical guidelines to help make taxable value calculations easier and will provide clarity for taxpayers to self assess their sales tax dealings. While safe harbours are not mandatory, if taxpayers
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        apply them and pay sales tax at the correct rate they will have met their sales tax liability for that transaction.
       </break>
      </para>

       The ruling provides simplified methods of calculating taxable value and may reduce the cost of compliance for taxpayers who choose that option.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       In conjunction with the professional bodies and the Corporate Taxpayers Association, the ATO has included processes in the ruling to manage the impact of the withdrawal of previous rulings and to give taxpayers time to consider their position. If a previous ruling conflicts with the principles in the new public ruling, it will be altered from 1 October 1996 giving taxpayers time to consider their position and to approach the ATO if their circumstances are not adequately dealt with in the ruling. If there is no conflict of principles, all private rulings issued after 30 June 1992 will cease to be effective 5 years from their date of issue.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       To date the ruling has been very well received by both the practitioners and taxpayers and there have been a number of positive reports in the media.

       The government's response to the Industry Commission's report was announced in my Press Release of 3 May 1996.
