Subject to parliamentary approval, construction activity is expected to commence in March 2022, with completion expected at the end of 2023. I commend this motion to the House.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—I'll make some brief remarks about the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's statement for the review of regulations listing Sonnenkrieg Division as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code Act 1995. This marks the first time that a right-wing extremist organisation has been listed as a terrorist organisation in Australia. Labor members of the committee join with our colleagues on the committee—I note that the member for Berowra, one of my colleagues on the committee, is present in the House—in welcoming the government's decision to list the Sonnenkrieg Division. But as my colleague Senator Keneally said in the Senate last night on the tabling of this report in the Senate, the fact that it has taken so long for the government to take this step is striking, and it is troubling. As ASIO has told this parliament time and time again, the threat posed by right-wing extremism to our country's safety and to the safety of its people is very real and very serious, and it's growing. Last month, ASIO's director-general told the Senate that countering the threat of right-wing extremism now constitutes almost 50 per cent of ASIO's counterterrorism workload. Three years ago it constituted 16 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can see the dangers with our own eyes and read about it day after day in our newspapers. We have seen the images and read the reports of dozens of neo-Nazis openly burning crosses and chanting racist and anti-Semitic slogans at a popular Victorian tourist destination. Hate speech targeting Muslims continues to be a massive and growing problem in Australia, especially online but also on the streets of our communities. The Christchurch massacre did not occur in a vacuum. As the Australia Muslim Advocacy Network noted in a recent submission to the parliament:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Before the attack in Christchurch, much of the broader population were not aware that anti-Muslim propaganda already permeated right-wing discourse online, or in part, inspired the Oslo terrorist, Anders Behring Breivik, who murdered seventy-seven (77) people in 2011.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Anti-Muslim content is considered to be a gateway to 'gradually introducing more racially and politically extremist messages to a large audience of potential supporters'. Canadian, Australian, US, and UK research has found Muslims to be a favoured 'out-group' around which radical right-wing activism or extremism coalesces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what the Australia Muslim Advocacy Network had to say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We as a community must take the rise in right-wing extremism seriously. We as a parliament must take the rise in right-wing extremism seriously. And it is incumbent on the government—especially the government—to take the rise in right-wing extremism seriously. Lives depend on it, as the Christchurch massacre, which was perpetrated by an Australian, so tragically demonstrated. Yet the Morrison government has not been taking right-wing extremism seriously, not by a long shot. In February of this year, we had the immigration minister contradicting ASIO and, without evidence, asserting that there had been no rise in right-wing extremism at all. In January of this year, following the extreme right-wing attack on the US Capitol, the Prime Minister refused to condemn or offer even the slightest criticism of the outgoing US President, Donald Trump, for Mr Trump's role in inciting the attack. Worse, the Prime Minister of Australia refused to even comment on, let alone criticise, social media posts by members of his own party that peddled dangerous right-wing extremist conspiracy theories about the attack on the US Capitol. This is the same Prime Minister who is now refusing to answer questions about his relationship with a prominent Australian proponent of the dangerous far-right conspiracy theory QAnon, Tim Stewart. Let me be clear: this is not about who the Prime Minister is friends with. As my colleague the member for McMahon said in the House the other day, the Prime Minister is not accountable for the political views of his friends, but when the Prime Minister allegedly gives a prominent proponent of far-right conspiracy theories which the American FBI has labelled a 'domestic terrorism threat' access to Kirribilli House, that is a problem, and there are legitimate questions to be asked—and the Prime Minister must answer them, not least of all because, as we heard on <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> this week, Mr Stewart's family has twice contacted the National Security Hotline to express concern about his behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To return to where I began, the intelligence and security committee welcomes the listing of the Sonnenkrieg Division as a terrorist organisation. While the committee found that Australians had little direct involvement with the Sonnenkrieg Division, its reach into Australia via its online activities poses a threat through the potential to radicalise Australians and to incite terrorist attacks. As my colleague Senator Keneally noted in the Senate last night, the pandemic has shifted more of our interactions online and this, along with the economic and social impacts, anxieties and uncertainties of the last 18 months, has intensified the spread of extreme right-wing narratives. But as Senator Keneally also noted, there are people in this very building who have been publicly entertaining these insidious and dangerous views and to date those people have been tolerated and, in some cases, even defended by the Prime Minister himself. From the Prime Minister down, the Morrison government must publicly and consistently disassociate itself and condemn those who promote and give comfort to conspiracies and far-right views, even—or perhaps especially—if that means turning its focus to the coalition's own party room. The listing of the Sonnenkrieg Division is a start but it is a very modest start.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Pensioners have worked hard and contributed all their lives. They deserve our respect. The age pension is a proud Labor legacy. The first iteration of the age pension was introduced by the Deakin Labor government in 1908. It sought to ensure that older Australians could live with dignity. I was raised by pensioners. They taught me the value of respect. They taught me the value of hard work. They taught me the value of money, the importance of saving, planning and budgeting: a penny saved is a penny earned. That's what pensioners do. They've worked hard. They've helped create the fundamental way of life that we know in this country today. They've looked after us, whether we're children or grandchildren. They budget carefully and they deserve our respect. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will always work to strengthen and improve the pension. Over the last eight years, Labor has sought to protect the pension from the government's relentless cuts to it, and relentless attempts to cut it. Retirement can be an anxious time. All of us understand that. The past year has been a time like no other, with extra health precautions, lockdowns, more time spent at home, reliance on food and grocery delivery services, and the need to purchase additional health products. It's been a particularly hard year for pensioners in meeting their added costs of living, especially those in Victoria—Melbourne, in particular—but, of course, right across the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian pensioners should be able—and are able—to continue to receive their pension overseas, should they wish. To that end, pensioners with 35 years of Australian working-life residence can receive the full base rate of the pension while overseas indefinitely. One of the great things about the social security system in Australia is its portability. Pensioners with less than 35 years of Australian working-life residence will receive a proportional rate after 26 weeks overseas. Recent events—the COVID-19 pandemic—have seen Australian pensioners stranded overseas through no fault of their own. Temporary arrangements were introduced to allow extensions to pension portability, meaning pensioners could continue to retain the full rate while overseas for longer than 26 weeks. The changes in this bill would enable these arrangements to continue, by providing the secretary with the discretion to continue the full rate in prescribed circumstances. It is the kind of commonsense flexibility that should be built into our social security system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes are necessary for the tens of thousands of Australians who remain stranded overseas, including many Australian pensioners. Australian pensioners stranded overseas have been failed by this neglectful government due to the severe delays in the vaccine rollout and failure to establish specialist quarantine facilities. They are the responsibility of the federal government. Labor has consistently called for the establishment of specialist quarantine facilities. Over a year since the beginning of the pandemic these facilities have still not been delivered. For over a year, the government stubbornly refused to acknowledge—inexplicably refused to acknowledge—its responsibility in quarantine. It has been dragged, kicking and screaming, to accept this responsibility. This is a government that has simply not treated the vaccine rollout with any urgency. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister said it is a race. Well, it is a race. In fact, I've just come from the Aboriginal medical service here in Canberra, having had my second vaccine. It is a race against further variants. It is a race to save lives and it is a race to save livelihoods, as my colleague has just agreed. It is a race that Australia is losing. Stranded Australians are paying the price, including Australian pensioners who are particularly vulnerable during this pandemic due to their age and health status. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this is not the first time pensioners have been let down by this government. Pensioners will never forget that before the government took power it pledged not to cut the age pension. But at the first opportunity they had, and over the past eight years, the government has cut, or tried to cut, the pension time and time again. Labor will consistently fight this. Labor has fought every single one of these cuts tooth and nail. Cuts to the pension are part of the government's thinking, part of the government's being and part of the government's DNA. As recently as August last year, the government was caught out by Labor on the pension freeze for 2.5 million pensions. Labor fought the government's disrespectful and cruel pension freeze. The reality is that pensioners plan for their twice-yearly indexation. One is on 20 March and one is on 20 September. The freeze took effect in September, and they made pensioners wait until the October budget before announcing any kind of relief. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also seen the government try to short-change pensioners through the pension deeming rates mechanism. Let me assure you, pensioners understand deeming rates very, very well. Deeming rates are used to determine how much pensioners earn from their secured financial assets, typically savings, for the purpose of determining their eligibility under the income test for a pension. The upper deeming rate in Australia at this point in time is 2.25 per cent and the lower deeming rate is just 0.25 per cent. If you are single, the first $53,000 of your financial assets has a deeming rate of 0.25 per cent applied. Anything over $53,000 is deemed to earn the other rate of 2.25 per cent. If you're a member of a couple and at least one of you gets a pension, the first $88,000 of your combined financial assets has a deeming rate of 0.25 per cent, and anything over $88,000 is deemed at the other rate of 2.25 per cent. With the cash rate nearing zero per cent—it's currently 0.1 per cent—it is impossible to see how pensioners could safely earn 2.25 per cent on their savings. With the government deeming pensioners to earn more than they really are, pensioners are receiving less for their pension. Whilst the minister might disagree with that, it is absolutely the case. Pensioners are being short-changed by the government's unreasonable and unrealistic pension deeming rates. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Pensioners won't forget this government's record on cutting the pension. The Liberals and Nationals are obsessed with cutting the pension, attempting to cut the pension in every budget, every year. In 2014, they tried to cut the pension indexation, a cut that would have meant pensioners would be forced to live on $80 a week less within 10 years. That is a lot of money, in any terms, and it is particularly a lot of money for pensioners. In 2014, they cut $1 billion from pensioner concessions, support designed to help pensioners with the cost of living. In 2014, they axed the $900 senior supplement to self-funded retirees receiving the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. In 2014, they tried to reset deeming rate thresholds, a cut that would have seen half a million part-pensioners made worse off. In 2015, they did a deal with the Greens to cut the pension for around 370,000 pensioners by as much as $12,000 a year by changing the pension assets test. In 2016, they tried to cut the pension for around 190,000 pensioners as part of a plan to limit overseas travel for pensioners to just six weeks. In 2016, they tried to cut the pension for over 1.5 million Australians by scrapping the energy supplement for new pensioners. They spent five years trying to increase the pension age to 70. As social services minister the member for Cook—the current Prime Minister—tried to cut the pension, and we will not forget that. As Treasurer the member for Cook tried to cut the pension, and as Prime Minister the member for Cook has also tried to cut the pension.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, there have been eight years of cuts to the pension by this government, and the government has only acted when it's been caught out on its cuts. Our pensioners deserve better than that, and Labor will continue to protect the pension. We will continue to fight the government's cruel cuts to the pension, and Labor will always ensure that pensioners continue to live with the dignity and respect they deserve.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:57</span>):  This bill, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Portability Extensions) Bill 2021, is a sad reminder for Australians that the government has failed them. It has left them without a vaccination and it has left them stranded in dangerous and unsafe parts of the world. Without this bill, they would also be left without the financial support which they desperately need right now. That's why Labor supports this bill, but we know that there are huge concerns from the people who this bill affects. People who are trapped because the government has failed to provide them with a vaccine and failed to bring them home deserve so much more from this government.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't forget, as the member for Barton has said, that this government cut social security to the bone. It was Labor that gave the largest increase to the pension in more than a century. Over the last eight years, we've seen this government try to cut the pension again and again and again—cut, cut, cut. For more than 20 years, pensioners could expect their pensions to rise as prices rose. That was always something that pensioners could rely on, but not under this government. This government has tried to stop pensioners getting the support they need, freezing their pensions. After pressure from Labor and the community—and pensioners, who don't mind standing up for themselves, because they know that this government won't stand up for them—the government capitulated and gave them two one-off payments. But it's part of a pattern of behaviour from the government when it comes to the pension. The pension payments that we provided to those stuck overseas are more than they would have been had Labor not stood up against this government's mean cuts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember: in 2014, there was the $80 cut from the pension with the removal of indexation; the $900 cut with the axing of the seniors supplement for self-funded retirees; and the $1 billion cut from pensioner concessions. That was just 2014, in the Abbott-Hockey horror budget. But they continued in 2015, because they actually believe in making life harder for pensioners who have worked their entire life. Expecting a secure, stable retirement, pensioners have to worry, every year, about what's going to come from this government in the budget. By changing the assets test, the government cut as much as $12,000 a year for some 370,000 Australians. That wasn't enough. In 2016, they cut the pension for around 190,000 pensioners by limiting their travel period to six weeks, and they cut the pension for around 1.5 million pensioners by scrapping the energy supplement for new pensioners. On the government's own figures, 563,000 Australians were worse off. When it comes to this government and what it might cut, the reality is that anything is possible. After the government has racked up $1 trillion of debt, with no reform plan, I worry that pensioners will be first in the firing line again when this government snaps back to its 'cut, cut, cut' approach to managing the nation's finances. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also has a habit of denying things and then, a few weeks later, doing them. I am worried by some very odd and carefully chosen language used by government ministers about the cashless debit card. This card, which has been trialled in a range of communities and has cost the government millions of dollars in terms of its rollout, is now being expanded. We know the minister 'wants to make this mainstream'. Making the cashless debit card—the 'cashless pension card'—mainstream will mean that pensioners lose the flexibility that they deserve in their retirement. Pensioners are worried. I bring the concerns of the pensioners in my electorate into this House. The minister has used some very careful language. The government are so sensitive about this because they know that what they are discussing is wrong. It is disrespectful of pensioners. </span>

We know that, when this government talks about expanding the cashless debit card into a cashless pension card, it is something that is of concern to pensioners. This government will now seek to expand this. Think about a stranded pensioner overseas—the people we're trying to help with this legislation. How would a cashless pension card work if you were stuck overseas? Could you use it in the UK? You wouldn't be able to. Could you use it if you were stuck in Indonesia? No. There are huge rollout problems with a cashless pension card, because they have to approve the providers. It's also a huge amount of red tape for businesses in my electorate. Any expansion of the cashless debit card is a huge expansion of red tape for the small businesses in my electorate.

                    </a>  As long as the government say that they want to make the cashless debit card mainstream, with a cashless pension card, I will continue to bring the concerns of my community into this chamber. That's my job—to make sure that we raise these concerns and that the government doesn't continue down this path. My view is that pensioners have made sacrifices. We've all made sacrifices over the last year, but pensioners have done it tougher than most. Before the pandemic, pensioners were making sacrifices. Research that the government commissioned after they started cutting the pension showed this. The research showed that a third of Australian pensioners were experiencing energy poverty. Energy costs have been a major concern for older Australians. Many pensioners spend a substantial portion of their income on power bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When this pandemic hit, it showed just how vulnerable pensioners were. I congratulate the McGowan Labor government in Western Australia, who saw that vulnerability and sought to provide a $600 credit to pensioners in my electorate so that they could continue to pay their power bills. Where the income supports that were being provided to pensioners during the pandemic weren't sufficient, the state stepped in. That's a pattern of behaviour that we see time and time again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that's important to note is that it's also pensioners and senior Australians who raise concerns about the lack of affordable renewable energy in our grid. Pensioners are people who do that long-term planning. They don't just think about how much money they're going to have this month or next month; they're thinking about the rest of their lives—20 years. Pensioners know that, over those 20 years, the only way they're going to have lower power bills and the energy they need to run their houses and keep them warm is to make sure that we start that important transition towards renewable energy. Otherwise, it's just going to be the same pattern that we've seen for the last eight years under this government—a 50 per cent increase in power bills, pensioners choosing to have cold showers and not put their heating on at night, and not being able to afford to run their air conditioners during heatwaves, as we experience in Perth on a regular basis.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll now come to the people who are stuck overseas that we are trying to help. As of 28 May, 35,000 Australians want to get home but can't. Many of them are older Australians; 4,260 of them are classified as vulnerable Australians. So, while we are passing this legislation to help them with financial support, I'd much rather we weren't having this debate. If the government and the Prime Minister had delivered on their promise to get everyone home by Christmas last year, this legislation wouldn't be necessary. It's as simple as that. We wouldn't need it. We need this legislation. It's been six months. It's another broken promise from this Prime Minister. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In India alone, there are more than 11,000 Australians who are trying to get home. Some of them are grandparents who haven't seen their grandkids for more than a year and families who have been separated by the incompetence and laziness of this government. The Prime Minister promised the Australian people in the middle of a pandemic that he would get these pensioners home. The Prime Minister having broken that promise, we finally have some legislation to at least provide them with their pension payments. This is the same Prime Minister who assures us that he is on a war footing in terms of how we're helping people.</span>

                    </a>  I withdraw. The Prime Minister said that we are on a war footing. But apparently this doesn't apply to the vaccine rollout or quarantine. If it did, we would be making proper use of our defence assets. If Labor was in government, we'd look at things like RAAF Base Learmonth as a priority to make sure we had the capacity to get these pensioners home so that we wouldn't have to send the cashless pension cards and payments overseas. Instead, we could just bring them home. That would also mean that they could spend their pension here in Australia and support Australian small businesses. But quarantine, despite being a Commonwealth responsibility, is not a priority, even though pensioners are stuck overseas saying, 'We want to come home; we want to get back to where we grew up, where we worked all our lives and where we can see our families and our grandkids.' We know that the Halton report recommended a purpose-built facility in Western Australia, but, because this government is so stubborn and so determined to ignore the expert advice, our nation is stuck. Premier McGowan has said very clearly that he would like to see 'a facility next to an international-capacity airport'. It's been suggested that Exmouth or Busselton could be the location. Premier McGowan said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just can't understand why you would choose to leave the most dangerous bits of quarantine in the middle of our CBD after we've had so many pieces of evidence that it doesn't work. I know what that means to the pensioners who live in my electorate: they are left vulnerable to these quarantine leaks which we see time and time again. They haven't had their full vaccination schedule. The information coming out of this government is light to non-existent at best, although I understand that every pensioner in my electorate next month will receive a personalised letter from the Prime Minister telling them about the vaccine schedule and why they should get vaccinated. When pensioners need a vaccine and the government's solution is to give them a letter from the Prime Minister, I think that just shows how badly the rollout of the vaccination schedule has gone.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has failed when it comes to the confidence that is needed in the vaccine rollout. This is a huge problem that this government fails to address. It's great that we've got this legislation, and it is very important for a very small number of people, but I'd also expect the government to do something for the very large number of people who are waiting for them to actually step up on the two jobs that they should be focusing on day in, day out: quarantine and vaccines. If you get quarantine right and you get vaccines right, we won't need legislation like this and we can bring the pensioners who are stuck overseas home. We can make sure they're spending that money here in Australia and we can reconnect Australian families who have been stuck apart for more than a year because of the incompetence of this government.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Portability Extensions) Bill 2021. I recently welcomed the temporary changes that were made to pension portability, meaning pensioners would be able to retain the full rate overseas for longer than 26 weeks. That was a commonsense measure. Let's not forget that, a year and a half into the pandemic, the government has left 35,000 Australians who want to come home stranded overseas. We've heard it from previous speakers. It's a fact. There was a promise made to bring them home, and they failed on it. They failed to keep their promise to bring them home by Christmas. Not even this government, surely, would be cruel enough to cut the retirement income of Aussies they've left stranded overseas?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this bill make sensible administrative changes to pension portability, which we support, there are significant and wider problems with the pension that need to be addressed, including by making more concerted efforts to increase the number of countries we enter into bilateral agreements with. That would allow Australians to more freely travel when they can and live in other parts of the world during their retirement or part of their retirement. I know that the government, in the most recent budget, allocated a bit over $18 million to enter into social security bilateral agreements like this with the Republic of Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. I think Australia should be more ambitious about what we can accomplish with that vast sum of money. But this government's leadership and ambition are often lacking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that Prime Minister Morrison, on his trip to Paris recently, met with President Macron—a very important meeting—and they talked about many important elements of the bilateral relationship. But why wasn't a bilateral social security agreement on pensions on the agenda? I would urge the government to look into developing a bilateral social security agreement with France. I've been contacted by numerous expat Australians in that country who worked and paid their taxes for decades in Australia and are unable to receive their pension. This is despite such a protocol, such an agreement, existing between Australia and 31 other countries, including 21 in the European Union, but not France. France actually has more than 40 such agreements in place with other countries, but not Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's probably true to say that many members on both sides of this House would agree with the ambition to sign more agreements with our friends and allies abroad when it comes to Australian pensioners being able to receive their pension when they are spending time overseas. What members on this side of the House do not agree with is the government's shameful track record of cuts to the pension and attempts to cut the pension. In a speech in 2015, a freshly minted Treasurer—now the Prime Minister—stated that the age pension should not be regarded as an entitlement for all. Let that sink in. He then outlined the government's vision for an overhaul of the country's retirement income system through reducing expenditure on welfare payments. This Prime Minister rejects in an ideological sense what is effectively a contract between the state and the citizens. Australian citizens pay their taxes all their working lives. They contribute to this country. They work hard and make a tax contribution. They are entitled to a pension in their retirement. That is part of the social contract. It includes things like defence and security, schools and education, hospitals and health care. It's not just a welfare payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor opposed those measures at the time because pensioners have worked hard and contributed all their lives to make this country what it is today. Older Australians deserve our respect and dignity. But this government tries to push through pension cuts at any opportunity. Many of those in the firing line of the coalition's attempts to cut the pension are migrants to this country who are now pensioners—after 30, 40 or 50 years working hard here, paying their taxes in Australia, building a life here, raising a family here. They should be able to receive a pension that allows them to live comfortably and reconnect with family and friends overseas that they may have left behind to come and build a life in Australia. These older Australians have made a sacrifice in many ways to build a life here in Australia and to become new Australians. They left their families and cultures behind to help build Australia through their work and their contribution. Yet we've got a government that drags its heels on doing all it can to support these people to spend their time with elderly relatives and long-lost friends. It wants to make their income uncertain if, for example, they were to accidentally spend a bit too much time overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at this government's track record and a few recent instances of where they have got their scissors out and tried to start cutting. As I mentioned, the Prime Minister, in 2015, when he was Treasurer, tried to cut the pension and increase the age of entitlement. In the 2014 budget the government tried to cut pension indexation, which would have meant pensioners would be forced to live on $80 less within 10 years. This unfair cut would have ripped $23 billion from the pockets of every pensioner in Australia. In the 2014 budget they cut $1 billion from pensioner concessions—support designed to help pensioners with the cost of living. In the same budget, the infamous 2014 budget, they axed the Commonwealth seniors health card. In the 2014 budget the Liberals tried to reset deeming rates, which would have made 200,000 part-pensioners worse off. In 2015 the government did a deal with the Greens political party to cut the pension of around 370,000 pensioners by changing the pension assets test. In the 2016 budget they tried to limit overseas travel for pensioners to six weeks. These are the people I was just talking about, who go overseas to visit family and friends after a lifetime of work here. The government also tried in that same budget to scrap the energy supplement for new pensioners. And in August last year the government was caught out by Labor on its attempts to freeze payments for 2.5 million pensioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Pensioners in this country would not be surprised to hear that the coalition has tried to cut the pension this many times. They are obsessed with it. They have tried to do it in every single budget over the last eight years. Cutting the pension, unfortunately, is in the Liberals' DNA. Building and supporting the pension is in Labor's DNA. When we were last in government we actually increased the pension by $30 per week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take a moment to show how this bill has an impact on my local electorate of Wills and the people who live there. It's an incredibly diverse electorate. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, just under half of the people in Wills either were born overseas or have at least one parent who was born overseas. Many of these people migrated in the postwar period—of Italian background, or Greek, Lebanese, Turkish, Vietnamese, Indian or Pakistani, and many others. These are some of the people who helped build this country. Many of my constituents go back to their country of origin to visit, to see their family, to see friends they haven't seen in many, many years. By the time they get there and the jet lag ends—because it's a long trip; we're far away in Australia—they may actually have to start thinking about coming home again, at around that six-week time frame. That is because the government hasn't done the legwork to build a more comprehensive network of agreements, as I was talking about earlier—social security bilateral agreements—to help them claim their pension overseas if they were to stay a bit longer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, these are Australians who have worked hard. They deserve that break to visit family and spend some quality time with long-lost friends and family overseas. And just because they're overseas it doesn't mean that their expenses are decreasing. Pensioners tell me again and again that land tax and council rates are rising, that the cost of living for them is constantly rising. Despite this, the government's instinct—its go-to—is to cut the pension to try to rip it away and make life harder for the nation's elderly. It's particularly cynical when you consider that the Treasurer has attempted to stimulate the economy by shovelling billions of dollars out the door, spending money to resolve the government's political problems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wouldn't increasing the pension help with the stimulus? Do you reckon pensioners would save this money in their sock drawer? Or would they spend it—on groceries, bills and gifts for the grandkids? Like JobSeeker recipients, pensioners aren't saving their payments. The additional money goes almost directly into the economy, to stimulate the economy—a good use of public money. Yet this government won't even consider it, because it runs counter to their ambitions to dismantle that social safety net that Labor spent so many years putting in place. They won't consider it because ideologically the Prime Minister—publicly—doesn't believe in it, because apparently it's an entitlement. Apparently this type of welfare needs to be ripped away, and government needs to move away from providing that kind of payment to pensioners or the vulnerable. Apparently he doesn't believe in that. And this is a deeply held belief. He doesn't think government should be doing this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a problem, because in recent years we've seen stagnant wages, declining productivity, high underemployment and declining living standards—all under this coalition government. And the government has no plans to really turn the economy around. As I said, the budget that they recently passed was all about spending money on what they perceived to be their political problems—a short-term political budget, long on spin and spending on political problems but short on any real investment in the Australian economy. That's not what a Labor government would do. We would invest in Australia's future while looking after those who helped to build this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The age pension is a fundamentally important aspect of this commitment, to ensure that older Australians can actually have a life in retirement that's one of dignity, after so many decades of working and contributing. The pension, Medicare, unemployment benefits, superannuation and the NDIS: these are all policies for the little guy, the average Australian—supporting those who have been doing it tough or who've worked all their life to make their contribution. These are the sorts of defining policies that Australians can trust the Labor Party to deliver if elected to government. And frankly, these are the kinds of policies that the coalition are ideologically opposed to, that they hate; they try to slash them at every opportunity. We've seen this government do that on so many occasions, as I've outlined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side will not stand silently as this government seeks to cut social services by stealth. We'll continue to put forward the progressive policies that will make Australian lives better and create that fairer society that we should all have.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MURPHY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:25</span>):  Of course we know that the pension isn't a welfare payment. The pension is a payment that goes to hardworking Australians—Australians who have often spent their entire lives in jobs that aren't high paying; in jobs that are physically demanding; in jobs that mean they haven't been the Australians that have been able to invest in three, four or five investment properties; in jobs that mean these Australians have toiled day after day to earn enough money to bring up their children to try to give them a better opportunity in life than they had. These are the Australians that are on the age pension. These are the Australians that deserve a government and deserve members of parliament who are always on their side. It is fundamentally disappointing that they don't have such a government right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Portability Extensions) Bill 2021, is needed, and it's supported by Labor because we understand that there are Australian pensioners who are stuck overseas because of the pandemic, because the borders rightly had to be shut, but also because this Morrison government has fundamentally failed in the vaccination rollout, in building fit-for-purpose national quarantine and in the Prime Minister's promise to bring all Australians who wanted to come home by Christmas of last year. So it's with no joy that we rise to have to support this legislation to support Australian pensioners, many of whom have been failed by the government's botched response to its fundamental duties to Australians during this pandemic: the vaccine rollout, the quarantine and the fact that, if you're an Australian citizen with an Australian passport, that should mean something. That should mean that, when you are stranded in another country, your government does everything in its power to get you home, which is not what this government has done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this government, over the long eight years—it likes to pretend, by the way, that somehow this is a government that is new and fresh and isn't to blame for things that happened over the last eight years. It's not a new and fresh government; it's been in power for eight long years, and we know that over those years this government has tried time and time again to attack Australia's age pensioners, to cut their pension.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last time Labor was in government, we increased the age pension by $30 a week. We understand working Australians and we understand their needs in retirement. This is a government that understands the words 'working Australians' because it likes to use them, but it doesn't understand their needs and it certainly doesn't understand their needs in retirement. If it did, it wouldn't have needed the opposition to catch the government out last year on the pension freeze for 2½ million pensioners. It wouldn't need the opposition, community members and pensioners themselves to raise their voices time and time again to fight against this government's pension freeze—a freeze that took effect in September. Pensioners had to wait for the October budget before knowing whether they were going to get any kind of relief. And then the relief in the form of the two one-off payments, whilst better than nothing, led to so many members of my community contacting me to say: 'This feels like a slap in the face. This feels like a token amount of money to shut us up because they realised there was a political problem because they weren't supporting 2½ million hardworking Australians who deserve a retirement in dignity.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know this is a government that, in the end, views people who receive support from the government—be it unemployment benefits, be it the disability support pension, be it single-parent pensions, be it the age pension—as people who are welfare recipients, as the leaners not the lifters, as the people they look down on and say, 'Well, we're here to help you,' from above, but not the people they live with and understand and really are there to help. How do we know this? We know this because this is a government that introduced a cashless welfare card for some of the most disadvantaged people in our community, because this government thinks it knows better than Australians about how to spend their money. How do we know this is a government that wants to control how hardworking Australians in their retirement spend their pensions? We know it not because Labor says it but because the minister responsible for the aged-care pension, for social services, said it herself. Last year the responsible minister was interviewed by the media and was asked: 'Are you going to roll out the cashless welfare card nationally?' Her answer was that this is a conversation we need to have about the card. She said, 'Well, initially, we thought it was to control people's gambling and whether or not they could drink alcohol and smoke. But now we know it's a wonderful budgeting tool for those people who are on low incomes.' It's a budgeting tool enforced upon them by the government, whether they like it or not. And we know that this government's plan, if they ever get the opportunity, is to roll out the cashless welfare card to pensioners across this country, because the responsible minister said it was 'a broader application for the whole community'. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, members of my community, every time you hear this government say that any suggestion they want to roll out the cashless welfare card to pensioners is nothing but a scare campaign, remember that the responsible minister talked about this card and its use as being something that would have 'a broader application for the whole community because it's a universal platform'. On behalf of my community, where one in five people are on a pension—disability support, age pension, single-parent pension—in this very chamber last year, on 7 December, not so very long ago, I put this challenge to the minister: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Will the minister say, once and for all, that it is not this government's intention to tell people on pensions, family tax benefits, single mothers supports, carers supports and disability supports how they can and can't spend their money?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister didn't respond. Not only did the minister not rule it out, the minister couldn't find words to respond—nor did any minister representing the minister find words to respond—because that's their plan, because we know that this is a government that's spoken to the big four banks and given them money to have a task force to set up the technology. They've spoken to supermarkets and Australia Post about the technology and about their plan to extend the draconian legislation. I asked on 7 December:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Will the minister stand up in this place today and rule out extending the cashless welfare card to other recipients of government allowances?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The answer was resounding silence, because the answer is yes; it could be extended. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of my community and Australians across this nation, I can tell you this: a federal Labor government would scrap the cashless welfare card. I will not give up fighting this plan to extend it to age pensioners, because I'm on your side and because Labor is on your side. We all know whose side this government is on, and it's not yours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final issue I want to raise before I finish my contribution in terms of pensions and portability is that there is clearly an emerging issue for Australian residents who are also Irish citizens and who receive part of a pension via the Irish system and part via the Australian system. I've had two couples contact me and my office, Thomas and Ursula, and Michael and Joan, who since the UK left the European Union are finding that their Irish pension is now subject to significant bank charges every month. It's so significant, in fact, that Michael and Joan are effectively losing half of one of their pensions every year because of these bank charges. From the investigations that my office has undertaken, it's a result of Brexit. It's a result of banking now being done through the European Union, and charges being levied, but no-one knows whether they're being levied by European, Irish or Australian banks. But these couples are now losing significant amounts of their pensions. It's a serious issue, in that, if it's affecting Irish Australians in my electorate, it's affecting Irish Australians across the country, and it's an issue that this government should be looking at and looking at immediately because, again, these are hardworking Australians who are living on a low income via pensions and they cannot afford to lose even $10 a month through bank fees.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="DZW" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ELLIOT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:37</span>):  I say from the outset that I support all of those on this side who have spoken before me, particularly in terms of their sentiments about our senior Australians, always remembering that these are the people who built our nation. They worked hard, they raised their families, they paid their taxes and they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and they also deserve to be able to access services when they need them—all things they're not getting from the Morrison government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have said we will support the bill before the House, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Portability Extensions) Bill 2021, and I support the amendments moved by the member for Barton—namely, that these changes to the bill are necessary due to the tens of thousands of Australians who remain stranded overseas, including many Australian pensioners; Australian pensioners stranded overseas have been let down by this government due to delays in the vaccine rollout and the lack of specialist quarantine facilities; and we're calling on the government to do more to bring those stranded Australian pensioners home, by accelerating the rollout and having those quarantine facilities in place. Our amendments also call on the government to not cut the pension.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've said, whilst we support the bill, we don't support the Liberals' and Nationals' relentless, sustained attacks on our pensioners over the last eight years. Whether it's the cuts to pensions, changes to the assets test or the expansion of the cashless welfare card, this is a government that Australians just do not trust. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to make some administrative changes in terms of pension portability, and we support this because the rate of pension available to pensioners who travel or live overseas needs to be looked at, and the legislation seeks to address areas that may have been outside a pensioner's control. So having changes to that portability is vitally important. And it's important, of course, in the context of the pandemic and the many challenges that has created. Many of us have been contacted by those stranded overseas, including many of our pensioners. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the government's consistent bungling of the vaccine rollout has created this situation. The government's absolute refusal to have dedicated quarantine facilities means we're in this situation. We've consistently called for the rollout to happen—it's just been consistently bungled. We've also called for those specialist quarantine facilities, but, due to the arrogance of the Prime Minister, they just won't do that. If we had these in place, we perhaps wouldn't be in this situation. So we'll continue to call upon the government to do that. This is the government's responsibility—vaccine rollout and quarantine facilities. We've seen so many Australians stranded overseas in the pandemic, as we've said, particularly our pensioners. As it stands with this bill, it seeks to extend some arrangements so there is greater discretion in terms of extending that portability in particular circumstances. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said, our seniors and our pensioners have worked hard and contributed all their lives, and they deserve respect and dignity. When Labor was in government, we did increase the pension by $30 a week. But the fact is over the past eight years the government has, time and time again, tried to cut—or has actually cut—the pension. We saw in August last year the government was caught out on its pension freeze for 2.5 million pensioners. We fought this cruel pension freeze because the reality is, as we know, pensioners plan for their twice yearly indexation. One is on 20 March and the other is on 20 September. The Morrison government's cruel freeze took place in September, and they made pensioners wait until October, until the budget, before announcing any kind of relief. This only came after intense pressure, because they were caught out with this pension freeze. The government then backed down and announced two one-off payments for pensioners of $250. One was in November and the other in February. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the government have tried to short-change pensioners through deeming rates as well. Deeming rates are used to determine how much pensioners can actually earn from their assets, typically their savings, for the purpose of determining their eligibility under the income test for the pension. The upper deeming rate is 2.25 per cent and the lower rate is 0.25 per cent. Of course, with the cash rate nearing zero per cent, it's difficult to see how pensioners could safely earn 2.25 per cent on their savings. So, with the government deeming pensioners to earn more than what they really are, pensioners are in fact receiving less for their pension. It's another example of pensioners being short-changed by the government's unrealistic and unreasonable pension deeming rates. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the biggest issues that pensioners continue to raise with me are their concerns about the Morrison government's cashless welfare card. Pensioners across the country know that the Prime Minister and the Liberals and Nationals want to expand the cashless welfare card to all pensioners right across the nation. These people know that if the Morrison government is re-elected they will force all pensioners onto the cashless welfare card, and this plan will put 80 per cent of their pension on a card that will limit what they can spend and where they can spend their own money. Under the Liberals and Nationals, all pensioners could soon be saying goodbye to cheap food and drinks at their local club, pub or RSL, or saying goodbye to being able to take out cash for their grandchildren on their birthdays or at Christmas time. Even buying a simple lotto ticket will be banned under this system. The fact is this plan of forcing all pensioners onto the cashless welfare card is insulting, demeaning and downright wrong. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the Morrison government's plans about this because they keep talking about it. They keep saying they want to make it universal. The minister says, 'Let's have a conversation about making it universal.' We've had many, many government MPs talk about how they want to expand it. We know it's on their agenda. Most importantly, pensioners know it's on their agenda. Right across the country, they are speaking out about this unfair plan. Pensioners really have a right to be very, very anxious about this, because the government's actually got a working group with the banks about their plan to make it universal and force all pensioners onto it. We saw the government signal in their recent legislation about putting income management in place for pensioners. They want to do it and put people onto this privatised card. As the government prepares for the national rollout of this pensioner welfare card, they've already blocked the cashless card at many pubs, RSLs and clubs across the country. Make no mistake, they are preparing to roll this out across the nation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will scrap the cashless welfare card, because pensioners must not be forced onto this nasty, unfair scheme. The fact is Australians should not have their spending controlled by the government—that's the fact. This government's agenda is all about privatising welfare and giving millions to a company to run the cashless welfare card. That is their entire agenda. But pensioners are onto them. They're onto this government and what they're doing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also point out that recently my electorate office received a phone call from a senior ministerial staffer in the Morrison government demanding I take down my Facebook post in relation to the Morrison government's cruel plan to force pensioners onto this cashless welfare card. For the record, I have not and I will not be removing this post. In fact, I will be posting more about this issue. I will continue to speak out every day in every forum about the Morrison government's cruel attack on pensioners, as well as about their cuts to Medicare and the aged-care crisis. I will continue to speak out and I will not be silenced by anyone in the Morrison government, not by any of them or by any of their MPs or their ministers or, indeed, not even the Prime Minister; I will not be silenced when it comes to these important issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, Labor stands with our pensioners. We will scrap this cashless welfare card because pensioners should not be forced on to it. But pensioners know you can't trust the Liberals and Nationals after the years of attacks they've had to wear from this government. Let's look at some of the things they've done over that time. Remember, these pensioners do not forget the government's horrendous record on cutting the pension. Why do they keep doing it? It is because they're obsessed with it; they are obsessed in every budget of trying to find another way to cut the pension. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look. In 2014 they tried to cut pension indexation, a cut that would have meant pensioners would be forced to live on $80 a week less within 10 years. In 2014 they cut $1 billion from pensioner concessions, which are designed to support and help pensioners with the cost of living, and we know one of the biggest issues for our pensioners is the increases in the cost of living for them. Also this Liberal-National government, in 2014, axed the $900 senior supplement to self-funded retirees receiving the Commonwealth seniors health card. In 2014 they tried to reset deeming rates thresholds, a cut that would have seen half a million part-pensioners made worse off. We all remember in 2015 when the Liberals and Nationals did a deal with the Greens to cut the pension to around 370,000 pensioners by as much as $12,000 a year by changing the pension assets test. We saw those massive changes to the assets test, thanks to the Liberals, the Nationals and the Greens—can't trust them at all. Then, with the Liberal-National government in 2016, they tried to cut the pension to around 190,000 pensioners as part of a plan to limit overseas travel to pensioners to six weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The list of these attacks goes on and on. In 2016, again, we also saw them trying to cut the pension for over 1.5 million Australians by scrapping the energy supplement for new pensioners; they just do not give up with their attacks on pensioners. Indeed, in that case, the government's own figures showed this would have left over 500,000 Australians who currently receive a pension or an allowance worse off. Over 10 years, in excess of 1.5 million pensioners would be worse off. Of course, no-one—absolutely no-one—forgets this government has spent five years trying to increase the pension age to 70. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that those of us on this side of the House are very proud of is that the age pension is very much part of Labor's legacy because we understand how important it is. We've always fought for it. We established it. It was introduced by the Deakin Labor government to ensure that our older Australians could live with dignity. We have always sought to defend it. We increased the age pension. We have fought this government every step of the way and we will continue to fight them at every turn when they try to cut and slash the pension. Anything that impacts our senior Australians, we will always stand with them and always fight for them because all we've ever seen from the Liberals and Nationals are consistent attacks in trying to chip away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our senior Australians have had enough. They have just had enough of this government and what they're doing. The prime example of that is their outrage about the government's plans for the cashless welfare card or the pension welfare card and their plans to roll it out for all pensioners. Our senior Australians have said, 'Enough is enough. We've had years and years and years of cuts and now you are going to introduce a card that tells us where we can spend our money, when we can spend it, what we can spend it on.' This is outrageous and insulting. These people have managed their money, lived their lives, paid their taxes, raised their families; they don't need this. It is outrageous to have it rolled out across the country. All those studies have shown how these cards do not work. We have seen so many reports to say they're ineffective and that they should be scrapped. Labor will scrap that because we know, in any format in those trials, they just have not worked.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is trying to be sneaky in terms of this rollout. There is heaps of evidence to say they want to make it universal. They want to roll it out. The minister keeps saying it. We've heard a lot of the National Party MPs talk about how: 'This is great. We'll roll it out everywhere'. The fact is they then insert it into legislation about its application for age pensioners as well. We know it's on their agenda. We know they want to do it. Whilst the cashless welfare card exists, the threat is always there that it will go to all pensioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government can lie and attack us and try to silence us. We'll stand with Australian pensioners every step of the way until we get rid of this cashless welfare card, because it is unfair. They can say whatever they want. The government can keep telling untruths about this. We know what their agenda is. It is essentially about privatising welfare. The millions that are going into this company to roll out this privatisation of welfare are quite frankly outrageous. The government should not be privatising welfare. They should not have plans like the cashless welfare card in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will continue to stand with the community, with our pensioners, with our seniors and with all of those who are subjected to the cashless welfare card to scrap that. We will always defend those vulnerable Australians, always making sure we can provide for them. Labor has a long history of doing that, and we will fight this government every single day, right up until the next election. We're standing up for those who need a Labor government to make a real difference in their lives.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  I will start by saying that, even though we will be supporting these measures, what the member for Richmond has said about the cashless welfare card is right. Regardless of which minister or minister's office decides to call on members of this side of the House to take down a particular post or not to advocate or not to put their views forward, we on this side of the House won't be silenced, as you heard the member for Richmond say. No member on this side will be. We know the cashless welfare card system, which we heard the member for Richmond speak about, is a system about privatising our services and making cuts to pensioners, making it harder for them. I commend the member for Richmond for not taking down the post. I guarantee you that no-one from this side of the House will be bullied into not advocating on behalf of their pensioners in their electorates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We say these things because, as I said, even though we're supporting this bill, unfortunately this government has a very bad track record when it comes to pensioners. If you go back in history, you can see the many governments that have come to this place, whether it be Labor or Liberal. In 2008 the Labor government was the first government to ever increase the pension—that is, an actual increase, not through the CPI and systems that increase the pension for cost of living or other mechanisms that are in place. They actually put a lump sum into the pension to increase it. It was Labor that did it. Labor is the friend of pensioners and always will be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know this bill is about pension portability and that it refers to the rate of pensions available to pensioners overseas and the secretariat having the ability to make decisions in circumstances that are different et cetera, but, as I said, you've got to look at the record of this government. Currently we're hearing the debate about the changes to Medicare. That's something that affects pensioners more than anything else. When I speak with pensioners, one of the things on their minds is always health and health services. You can see the damage that this government has done to Medicare. I know this bill is about pension portability, but it affects pensioners' lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When this government came to fruition in 2013, one of the very first acts in that very first budget was to cut billions of dollars away from health. We're seeing the outcome of those cuts trickle down into the states where you see emergency departments absolutely chock-a-block with not enough beds or rooms to put patients in, not enough doctors and not enough nurses. You can't make billions of dollars' worth of cuts to health through the federal budget and not expect it to have an adverse effect in the states, where the money is being administered, put into hospitals et cetera. We're seeing this in South Australia right now, and it has an enormous effect on pensioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Talking about pensions, the member for Richmond talked about deeming rates and how this government tried to change them. The assets test affects pensioners who have perhaps accumulated a few savings or perhaps have a second house. The value of the assets threshold has always gone up, keeping up with inflation. This is the first government that has cut it and brought down the threshold for assets, affecting hundreds of thousands of pensioners who have lost money on their pension.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we're supporting this bill because it will allow pensioners who are stuck overseas a certain period of time in which they can continue to receive their payment before they have to be back here, before their pension is cut off. The pandemic has been a great example of this. The bill will enable the secretary of the department to make decisions based on individual circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For many Australians who were born overseas, and for Australians who were born here, being able to spend extended periods of time with relatives, with family, is extremely important. Currently, pensioners who have 35 years of working-life residence can receive the full base pension indefinitely while overseas. Pensioners with less than 35 years receive only a proportional rate. I've always been of the belief that, if you've worked and are eligible for the pension, it is your choice when you retire and, as a pensioner, decide to go from Melbourne to live in Queensland because it's sunnier or to go from Adelaide to live in Broome because of the weather. That is your right. But it is also your right to go and live in Italy or Greece or Serbia if you want to. It shouldn't be any different. This discriminates. I've always been of that belief, and I'll continue to be of that belief, because people who have worked and have paid their taxes should have the right to earn their pension and live wherever they want to. In fact, Australia saves when that happens. We've seen figures over the years that show that while pensioners are overseas there are health costs, medicine costs and a whole range of other benefits that they may not get when they're overseas. It is actually a cost saving for Australia, and it's about time we started thinking about these things and not putting pressure on pensioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has one rule for one and another rule for another. We saw in here yesterday in the debate on JobKeeper that some of the multinational companies and multimillionaire business people in this country have received millions and millions of dollars of government handouts, taxpayers' money, for JobKeeper. Yet, at the other end of the scale, we're constantly pursuing pensioners and trying to see how we can cut the pension. That's wrong. It's not on. Our pensioners, who have worked all their lives and paid their taxes, deserve the ability to retire and be confident of their pension, wherever they decide to live.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will give some flexibility. We've seen during the COVID-19 pandemic how many Australians were stranded overseas through no fault of their own and couldn't come back to Australia. Some are still stranded overseas, despite the Prime Minister having said he'd have every Australian home by Christmas last year. As a result, temporary arrangements were introduced to allow extensions to pension portability—in other words, to be able to receive your pension wherever you are—meaning pensioners would be able to retain their full rate of pension whilst they were overseas for longer than 26 weeks. There are many reasons not only during a pandemic but even without a pandemic as to why people are forced to stay overseas. There could be a serious accident, for example. You could have been planning to go overseas for six, eight, 15 or however many weeks, needing to be back owing to your Centrelink obligations et cetera, but have a serious accident and be unable to leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were getting calls in my office over many years from people who were stranded overseas and were fearful of their pension being cut—serious illness, the death of a family member, custody proceedings in a country in which the person is located or a legal requirement for that person to remain in that country, outside of an Australian connection with proceedings and other things. Robbery is another great example. You could be ready to leave but you're robbed and lose your passport and have to stay for an additional week or two.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So these changes are the right thing to do, to provide the ability to look at the actual circumstances of that person and why they're still overseas. But the government's taken a long time to enact measures that assist pensioners. This is a measure that will assist them. As I said, we've become very used to seeing this government trying to chip and cut at people's age pensions. Pensioners have worked very hard all their lives. Many of them have even fought in wars on our behalf. We should be making their lives simpler.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The pension is a very proud legacy of Labor. It was introduced by a Labor government so that we could ensure that older Australians could live with dignity. Pensioners have worked hard. They've contributed all their lives. They deserve dignity and respect, and they deserve a government that's on their side, not constantly looking at cutting, at chipping, at manoeuvring themselves with cashless welfare cards and a whole range of other things just so they can cut money from pensioners for the budget. On the other hand, we have a government that's given out billions of dollars to multinationals and millionaire businessmen under JobKeeper, and they turn a blind eye; they're not even interested in following up to see how they can recover some of that taxpayers' money. And pensioners paid taxes through their working lives—to be handed over to millionaires and billionaires. It just doesn't make sense to me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House, as we heard the member for Richmond say earlier, Labor will fight for pensioners. We will stick up for pensioners, and we will ensure that pensioners get the dignity they deserve through the systems we have so we can not only acknowledge what they've done for this nation and for the next generation but also allow them to live in dignity. Only Labor will fight for that. As I said at the beginning of my speech, when Labor was in government we were the first government to ever increase the pension—not by the CPI or other mechanisms but to give pensioners a lump sum every fortnight from thereon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past years all we've seen this government do is try to cut the pension, and we've seen it time and time again. It seems to be a national sport for the conservative Liberal-Nationals government—continually, no matter when they are in power. Whether in the Fraser years or in the Howard years, the government was always attacking pensioners first. And, as I said earlier, it's not just through the pension. Health is also very important. We've seen proposals to change Medicare, which will make it harder for pensioners to get hip replacements, shoulder replacements, knee replacements and a whole range of other things. That will have an effect on them. That is part of the pension scheme that we have, to ensure that we have a universal health system for those people who need it more than anyone. As we all know, as you age you become frailer, and illnesses set in, so older people are reliant on good government health services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a whole range of things that we need to do in order to assist pensioners. We've seen this government cut the energy supplement. I know, through the pensioners I speak to in the federal electorate of Adelaide that I represent, that the supplement had been a big help to them. It was a huge help to know that you'd be getting $90-odd every so often to assist you with energy costs, with payment of bills et cetera. That is gone. With the changes to the assets test, as well, we saw pensioners who had a few savings on the side, to supplement their income, missing out on payments that they had planned on—and no-one retires and goes onto a pension or a part-pension without planning their future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then you have a government like this Morrison-Abbott-Turnbull government that comes in and pulls the rug out from under your feet. You can imagine someone who is retired and is getting a part-pension or a full pension, with a small accumulation of assets, and then a government comes in and changes it all. When you were planning to live on X amount of dollars for the rest of your life, all of a sudden you just get a great big chop. That's not on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They axed the $900 senior supplement to self-funded retirees receiving the Commonwealth seniors health card. That's another one. They tried to reset the deeming rates thresholds. That would have seen half a million part-pensioners made worse off. So you've got a government that is continuously trying to cut and chip away at pensions yet on the other side is handing out billions of dollars to the richest businesspeople here in Australia and turning a blind eye to it when it's realised that that money that was given to those millionaires and billionaires was for a specific purpose: to keep people in jobs—and many did. But in some instances there was no need for it, because their businesses grew 10-fold during the pandemic. That money should be paid back into the coffers of Treasury so pensioners can have more money to live on and we can do more for pensioners with some of that money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016 we saw this government cut the pension to around 190,000 pensioners as part of a plan to limit the overseas payment to pensioners to six weeks. As I said earlier, if you're a pensioner and you decide to retire in Adelaide, in my electorate, and you want to go and live somewhere else, you should have every right to do so. This is a cruel government that's never looked after pensioners. Only Labor will look after pensioners. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <a href="53517" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Portability Extensions) Bill 2021 and to speak in favour of the second reading amendment moved by the member for Barton. I listened to what the member for Barton said in her remarks to the House today, and at the conclusion of her comments a phrase rang true for me. I wondered where I'd heard it before and I rang some family members. She said, 'A penny saved is a penny earned.' That is a saying my grandmother used to use all the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My grandmother, Evelyn Margaret Budden, was the sole parent of four children and she was a retail worker. In her later life she worked at David Jones in Queen Street in Brisbane. She worked up until the age of about 70, and one morning, when she was getting off the escalator, she broke both her wrists and was forced to retire, so she went onto the pension. That was about when I was born. I remember when going to my nan's house and catching up with her that she had a little book in her green handbag. She would go to this a couple of times a day. That was her pension book, where she would write down exactly what she was spending, how she was going to spend her money and what she was spending her money on. She was a very proud woman and a very trusted and honourable person. People on the pension have to rely a lot of times on their wits, on their abilities, and they have to watch every penny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She was also a very strong Labor supporter, and I remember that as kids we asked her, 'Nan, why are you such a strong Labor supporter?' She always said one thing straightaway. She said, 'Labor, when I was a young mum and when child endowment came in'—I think it was about 1941 or 1942—'it was five shillings paid directly to the mother.' It was the first time it was paid to the mother. She remembers clearly that payment coming in for her four kids when she was on her own, raising those children. It was the first time they could afford to buy golden syrup. She said, 'Under a Labor government, that's what allowed our family to go ahead.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm really proud to speak on behalf of the pensioners in my electorate as well as all those pensioners who have gone before us in this nation, who have helped build our nation, like my grandmother, who if she were still alive would be terribly embarrassed that I was talking about her. She would just say, 'Get on with it,' so I will. I speak on behalf of the almost 20,000 people, in the Oxley electorate, aged over 65 to 70 and the 12,850 people on the age pension that I represent, making sure that their voices are heard in this parliament. A lot of those pensioners go week to week, fortnight to fortnight, making sure that they look after every penny. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to raise my voice on a number of issues in support of the bill today. It's a pretty straightforward bill. Administrative changes ensure that the pension rate is available to pensioners who travel or live overseas and, in certain circumstances that are outside of a pensioner's control, allow the secretary to make a declaration that prevents pension rates reducing in line with usual rules. I want to focus on the record of this side of the chamber versus the government's appalling record when it comes to dealing with pensioners. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to talk about this issue that's been raised today, and that pensioners are also discussing with me, about the cashless pensioner card that the government has not successfully ruled out as an option for the 12,850 pensioners I represent. Around 67 per cent of people aged over 65 in my electorate are, directly, on the age pension. When I talked to some pensioners on the weekend, at the Blue Fin Fishing Club, and explained that the government may be using this as an option, they were horrified—but also embarrassed that a government in Australia may take away their ability to spend their own money. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Jagajaga said, it's judgemental, it's wrong and it's offensive to pensioners, and I won't stand for it. The member for Richmond has been leading the charge on this, side by side with the member for Barton. Labor is the party of pensioners. Labor is the party that delivered the pension in the first place and delivered the first historic increase for the pensioners of Australia. Labor will also be the party that fights the government's plan to introduce this shameful debit card to pensioners, forcing them onto it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't take my word for it. I'll quote what Minister Anne Ruston's—I had to google who she was!—lines were on this. When she was asked about it, she said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… whether there is a conversation that the Australian public would like to have about the broadening of the use of the card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is she raising this in the first place? If I was asked that as the minister for social services in this country, I'd say, 'Not over my dead body.' That's exactly what I would say, and so would the member for Barton if she was privileged to be the minister in this parliament. She should be the minister in this parliament, to make sure that pensioners' voices are heard and that those issues are raised. In 2020 the Prime Minister's social services minister said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… I see from the cashless debit card becoming a more universal platform …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does 'a more universal platform' mean? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's great at ripping into the vulnerable. It is always weak against the strong but strong against the weak. We know this government is not on the side of pensioners, and I know there are members on the other side getting the same feedback that I am receiving from pensioner groups in my community and my electorate. They would be getting the same concerns in emails and telephone calls and the social media campaign that's being run around this. I pay tribute to the advocates. It started in Bundaberg and is spreading out across Australia. I know every single member of this parliament would have pensioners contacting them through the various platforms. We saw the social services minister, last week—this is the person in charge of running the social security system in this country—go onto the member for Richmond's Facebook page and start trolling her because she was standing up for pensioners. It is completely unacceptable that members of parliament should somehow be chastised for speaking out on behalf of pensioners. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government has its way, pensioners won't be able to buy second-hand goods. They may not be able to give cash to grandkids. They may not be able to have a cheap meal or a roast at the local RSL if they're not signed up to it. If the government has no plans to roll this out to pensioners, why are there venues right across this country already listed, already banned? Why is it in the legislation that it can apply to pensioners? Why is it in there? Why did the government do that? I voted against that legislation, and so did every other member of parliament on this side of the chamber.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at my home state of Queensland, which has hundreds of thousands of pensioners. In the electorate of Dickson, there are around 13,288 people on the age pension. In the electorate of the member for Petrie, who is at the table here—</span>

I tell you what: there's one person who will be fighting it, and that's the Labor candidate for Petrie, Mick Denton, a blue-collar worker, a frontline worker, who's fighting for pensioners in the Petrie electorate.

                    </a>  You can set your watch by it, Madam Deputy Speaker. They've all got glass jaws. They like to dish it out but they don't like to hear it. We know that, if they were truly not interested in this, he'd jump up and deny that the government's got any plans, but he remains silent, just like the government.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the electorate of Longman, where there are 23,937 people on the age pension, Rebecca Fanning, the Labor candidate, is speaking out on behalf of pensioners. In the electorate of Bowman—as if the electorate of Bowman don't have enough to deal with with their sitting member at the moment—there are 20,016 people on the age pension. Sixty-five per cent of people over 65 are on the age pension. It is disgraceful that this government has a secret plan to consider rolling out this plan across pensions across Australia. The minister hasn't denied it. The Prime Minister hasn't denied it. They have said on record that they are looking at expanding this across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has form when it comes to pensioners—cutting the pension in every budget. The Liberals and Nationals are obsessed about cutting the pension. They have attempted to cut the pension at every budget, every year. In 2014 they tried to cut pension indexation. In 2014 they cut $1 billion from pensioner concessions. In 2014 they axed the $900 senior supplement. In 2016 they tried to cut the pension to around 190,000 pensioners, as part of the plan to limit overseas travel. In 2016 they tried to cut the pension for 1½ million Australians, by scrapping the energy supplement for new pensioners. They have spent five years trying to increase the pension age to 70. You go and talk to those nurses who work with my mother, who is a midwife, and the people who work as teachers alongside my sister. Those women do physical, hard work, and this government wants to raise the pension to 70—time and time again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the chamber, we're going to stand up for pensions and pensioners, because we always have. Our record speaks for itself when it comes to standing up for pensions. I am proud to be a member of the party that delivered a record increase in pensions and that delivered the pension in the first place. We know the ideological extremism of this government, who are completely obsessed with cutting pensions and cutting welfare. We on this side believe in an inclusive and tolerant society that will always look after those who need to be looked after, and that is exactly what we will do. You betcha—through you, Madam Deputy Speaker, to the member for Petrie—I'm going to speak out. I'm going to stand up in this parliament and speak every day for pensioners. They helped build this country. We stand for them and we stand by their side as well.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Youth and Employment Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  This bill, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Portability Extensions) Bill 2021, makes amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 to include a permanent discretion to provide portability extensions for pensioners who are temporarily overseas—or who usually live overseas and are temporarily in Australia—and are unable to return home as planned for reasons beyond their control. Allowable reasons include unforeseeable and emergency events such as a serious accident, the death of a family member, a natural disaster or a public health crisis. The measure will assist pensioners who are away from home due to unforeseeable and emergency events beyond their control by ensuring their rate of payment or grandfathering status is not affected after 26 weeks. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to respond to the misleading and untrue claims raised by the Labor opposition in respect of the cashless debit card during this debate, which we just heard from the members opposite. They are entirely unrelated to the legislation being debated. I call on Labor and the shadow minister to end their campaign of lies and fearmongering when it comes to age pensioners. It is completely false to claim that this government has a plan to force pensioners onto the cashless debit card. Let me repeat that for the shadow minister and for the member for Oxley: it is completely false to claim that this government has a plan to force pensioners onto the cashless debit card. There you have it. This government has no such plan—let me repeat this for the shadow minister—and it never will have such a plan. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cashless debit card is for people on working-age payments, to help them stabilise their lives, become job ready and get back into the workforce. As the Assistant Minister for Youth and Employment Services, I think that's very important. It's shameful that you people didn't support that on another piece of legislation. It's a shame. At the end of the day, I believe the opposition want to keep people down. They want to keep them on the hand of government. They don't want to see people being able to improve their lives. That's the problem with members like the member for Oxley and those opposite: they don't care about other people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think I've made my point. In fact, the most recent sites in which the card was introduced were Bundaberg and Hervey Bay, where it applies only to young people—those aged 35 and over. According to the member for Hinkler up there, it has the strong support of the community and it's working and helping people there. It has nothing to do with pensioners at all. Labor's claim simply has no basis in fact, and they really should be ashamed of themselves. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  The original question was that the bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Barton has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the amendment be disagreed to.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="37998" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHALMERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:45</span>):  Thank you for the opportunity to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (2021 Measures No. 4) Bill 2021. As the House would be aware, there are a number of schedules in this bill which implement measures from the last two budgets. There's a measure on the fringe benefits tax, there's a measure on the Junior Minerals Exploration Incentive, there's one about granny flats and capital gains tax, there's one about the way ASIC and the product intervention regime work and there's one for members of New Zealand sports teams who have spent longer than expected in Australia because of COVID-19. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the most prominent part of the bill before us, of course, is the extension of the low and middle income tax offset. Both sides of the House support the low and middle income tax offset. We have done so since the very beginning. We do think, when it comes to tax relief in the budget, that the priority should be those who need it most and who are most likely to spend it in the economy. Since the beginning, since the last term of the parliament, we have said that we are enthusiastic supporters of some cost-of-living relief for the Australians who are doing it toughest. So, of course, our position on these bills before the House reflects that. We'll be supporting these bills through the House and through the Senate. We'll be supporting the individual measures, but, most particularly, supporting the extension of some more tax relief for people on modest incomes in this country who are doing it tough, the people who we want to be spending in our shops and small businesses and local communities right around Australia. So we support the bills for that reason. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are, though, a couple of points that need to be made for the public record as these bills make their way through the House and through the Senate. The first point is the obvious point that the extension of the LMITO, the extension of this particular offset, happens to—what a coincidence!—push this tax relief to immediately beyond the next election. This tax relief ends on 30 June next year, which may be a few weeks or a few months after the next election. Because those opposite have form with making decisions for purely political reasons, I think there is a lot of concern in the community that the extension of this tax relief—otherwise welcome tax relief—is being pushed just to the other side of an election, where millions of Australians will then get a tax hike when this offset is removed. I think Australians are right to be suspicious and sceptical of a government which always puts the politics before the economics and which is always thinking in terms of the next election and not necessarily what is the optimal outcome for people. I think perhaps the starkest evidence of that, in a budget chock full of other examples of decisions taken to plug political holes, is the extension of this LMITO to immediately after the next election. It really is the most stunning example of that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next point I'd like to make is that in the budget a little over a month ago—and then, indeed, this week—the Treasurer put some numbers out into the public sphere about what this tax relief means for the amount of jobs created in the Australian community. Clearly, the 120,000 or so jobs that the Treasurer is claiming will flow from this tax relief—obviously, we want to see jobs created. We want to see a heap of jobs created in the community. We welcome the strong labour force figures that were released in the last 20 minutes. I expressed that privately to the Treasurer, who's here, and I expressed it publicly. We want to see jobs created. We want to see Australia recover strongly from the recession of last year. But, more than that, we want to make sure that those jobs are good, secure, well-paid jobs. Targeting the unemployment rate is important, but it's not the full story.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a challenge here with underemployment. We've got a challenge with insecure work. We've got a challenge with some of the structural barriers that are in our society and prevent people from grabbing the opportunities of a recovering economy. These barriers include child care, training, concentrated disadvantage and the like. And so I think it's important to understand, even as we acknowledge the improvement in the unemployment rate today, that that is not the full story. There is a bigger story here in the labour market, and it's about job insecurity, underemployment and what that means for record-low wages growth in this country, which has been the defining feature, in my view, of the economic management of those opposite over the last eight years or so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wages had been growing at a record slow pace under those opposite even before COVID-19. It is not necessarily a problem created by COVID-19. It has been a feature of the economy for some years now. The long-serving finance minister Mathias Cormann said that stagnant wages growth was a deliberate design feature of the coalition's economic policy. So this stagnant wage growth has not been accidental. It has been a deliberate feature of those opposite when it comes to the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Think about that record while I'm speaking about that stagnant wages growth. We had quite a stunning report from the Productivity Commission released overnight as well. The conclusions of the report were that, when it comes to national income, the last decade—overseen in large part by those opposite—has seen the slowest growth in national income and economic growth per person out of the last six decades. Those opposite, of course, have been in charge for eight of those 10 years. What that means, according to the Productivity Commission, is that national income is about $11½ thousand less in the last year of the last 10 years than it would have been had the productivity growth and economic growth continued as it was before those opposite got the keys to the Treasury.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are important factors that we need to consider as we think about the extension of this low- and middle-income tax offset, the jobs claim by those opposite and the broader claims made about the economy by those opposite. Whether we look at the Productivity Commission report or all of the other data that we have before us, we see that there have been issues with the economy in the last eight years: wages, productivity, business investment, living standards and per-person national income. We need to do better as a country than just going back to that. I fear that the ambition of those opposite is limited to simply going back to how things were before COVID. Things weren't real flash for a lot of people, particularly Australian workers, particularly people on modest incomes, before COVID-19. We can do better than going back to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To go back to the 120,000 jobs claimed by the Treasurer, flowing from this tax relief and these tax bills: we also need to remember it's the same Treasurer who said 450,000 jobs would flow from the JobMaker policy. That was the centrepiece of last year's budget, in October last year. He said 450,000 jobs would flow from JobMaker. Instead, we know from estimates that it was more like 2,000 jobs that came from JobMaker, so I think we are right to be a bit sceptical about the grand claims that the Treasurer makes about how many jobs will flow from his policies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next point I wanted to make—really the final set of points I wanted to make—was about the claim that the Treasurer likes to make about how those opposite are the party of low taxes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  I'm very pleased that the member for Goldstein came in at that point, because the unfortunate, inconvenient reality of the numbers in the Treasurer's own budget is that the two highest-taxing governments of the last three decades have been the Howard government, No.1, and the Morrison government, No. 2. And so this absolute rot, this absolute rubbish, this absolute bollocks that we hear from those opposite about their being the party of low taxes is not borne out by any number in the Treasurer's own budget. This is not a number that we've put into the public domain. If you go to the back of Budget Paper No. 1 and you look at the historical tables, it's very clear there. They've laid it out for us in quite a simple way—the highest-taxing government. Well, actually, the highest-taxing government on record ever is the Howard government; the second highest-taxing over the last 30 years is the Morrison government. So enough of this rubbish about being the party of low taxes. Taxes have never been higher than they were under Howard and, in the last 30 years, have never been higher than they have been under Prime Minister Morrison.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that those opposite have their slogans and they have their spin. The unfortunate thing is that the back of the Treasurer's own budget paper says that those claims made by those opposite are nothing more than a lie, frankly. They've lied about this repeatedly. We should have a debate in this country about the appropriate level of tax, but that debate should be informed by facts. I'm happy to use the Treasurer's own numbers when it comes to the level of tax in the economy. Those opposite like to talk about what a great prime minister Prime Minister Howard was. They need to acknowledge that Prime Minister Howard was also the highest-taxing prime minister in the history of the Commonwealth, much higher—much, much higher—than Prime Minister Whitlam and higher than Prime Minister Hawke, Prime Minister Keating, Prime Minister Rudd and Prime Minister Gillard. The gold medallist when it comes to tax is Prime Minister Howard. The silver medallist in the last 30 years is Prime Minister Morrison. So let's have those facts on the table. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite are not the party of lower taxes when you look at the historical record. But they are the party of the highest debt we've ever had in the Commonwealth—a trillion dollars in debt, with too little to show for it. They are, and the Productivity Commission belled the cat overnight, the party of weak productivity growth. They are the party of stagnant wages growth. They are the party of stagnant business investment. They are the party that likes to talk a big game when it comes to economic management, but, when you line up all of those facts across all of those areas that I've just mentioned, then once again their claims are exposed for the hollow, shameless spin that they are.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:57</span>):  It was wonderful to hear the shadow Treasurer before the parliament as he lamented the rate of tax that's paid in this country. Make no mistake—no ambiguity—I am for lower taxes, because taxes are about empowering individuals and families to take responsibility for themselves. And I absolutely believe taxes in this country are too high and I'll continue to argue that taxes should be cut. It's one of the reasons we went to the last election opposing Labor's plan for nearly $400 billion more in taxes. And the temerity, the chutzpah, the hubris, the arrogance, whatever you want to call it, of the shadow Treasurer, who was the architect of that plan with the then shadow Treasurer, the member for McMahon, to then say, 'They're taxing too much,' this side of the chamber is, frankly, farcical. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you propose $400 billion more in taxes on the Australian people, the Australian community, Australian jobs, Australian workers, Australian small businesses, mums and dads all around the country, as Labor did before the last election—and, let's face it, whether honestly or secretively, will do the same before the next election—to come into this chamber and argue against this government, which has consistently said, 'Where there are taxes and we can cut them, we will,' including the low- and middle-income tax offset in this bill about restructuring the entire base of the tax system and flattening out income tax, is, frankly, absurd. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We stand for lower taxes—as a party, as a movement and as a principle—and we do so, as I said before, not because we can have an argument about the GDP-to-tax ratio, although that's very important, but because it's actually about power. The foundational difference is the difference between the world views that sit in this chamber, on this side versus that side of the chamber. People on this side of the chamber see the nation governed from the citizen, the family and the community up. We want to empower individuals, families and communities. The Labor Party has a different vision for the country—and they're entitled to that; it's part of the great contest of ideas, which is one I believe we should have, and all policies should be anchored from that basic proposition. They want to empower Canberra, unions and increasingly organised capital through superannuation funds that they have influence over so that they can run a corporate state, so that they can run a nation in the hands of the few with a claim of benefits for the many. But of course we know that the more concentrated is economic, political, social and cultural power the more it favours those who dictate and wield that power—it's just that they think that should be them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're proud of our achievement on taxes. But I absolutely agree that there's more to do. That's in part what this bill is about. It's about saying, 'Hey, we're going to give a tax offset to low- and middle-income earners.' Why? Because we want these individuals to be able to be the masters of their own destiny, to choose their future and to be empowered as much as possible. And I'd hope there's more to come—much more to come—because the more power that's in the hip pocket of Australians, the more we're empowering them to make choices about their own lives rather than having it imposed on or dictated to them by bureaucrats or politicians based in this chamber. It's quite a good thing, really, when you think about it—and I hope you do, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, although I suspect you have been, for a very long period of time, throughout your long and distinguished service in this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's at the core of what this bill is trying to achieve—and will achieve. There are of course other measures, around reforming ASIC and the fringe benefits tax and various other issues around incentives. One of the critical things that's also in this bill is that we're Australians through all stages of their life. Mr Deputy Speaker, you'll be well aware that one of the big concerns I have is around making sure that Australians have proper housing so that they're able to have the security and the opportunity that they need throughout their working life and their retirement. One of the great challenges in housing—and there are many in this nation at the moment, particularly for young Australians looking to buy their first home—is making sure there's available supply in the marketplace. A critical part of that conversation relates to people having access to housing supply that reflects their stage of life. The reality is that a lot of the housing stock that traditionally has been built has been targeted specifically at people during a particular stage of their life, often where there are multiple inhabitants, because they're having children with their spouse, raising their family. But of course people don't always need three-, four- or five-bedroom homes; lots of people need just a one-bedroom apartment, or a two-bedroom apartment—and of course that's often the property people purchase when they're youngest, and then they graduate up as they need to, and they might sell the property and reverse back to having smaller accommodation as they downsize. As you may recall, there are incentives in the budget to encourage people to downsize in order to open up that housing stock for the next generation as they have children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But of course there can also be circumstances where people decide they need to downsize further than perhaps a small unit or apartment, because they may become increasingly dependent on their families for care, or because of their economic circumstances. There might have been tragedy, such as losing their spouse. So, they turn to things like granny flats, as we colloquially refer to them, often co-located with their families so that they can have economic and financial security as well as household security and mutual care and support from those they love and care about. Currently there's a CGT arrangement on granny flats, which is discouraging, because the co-location of flats on existing properties could actually help bring families together. So, we're reforming that to encourage Australians to be able to care for and love each other through mutual cohabitation on a single site. This is very important because it will again free up the opportunity for people to move through the different stages of life based on their accommodation and their accommodation arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we also want to make sure that young Australians are in the best position to be able to purchase their own home, and that's why freeing up capital is so important. The reality is there are lots of factors that drive house prices in this country—availability of supply, interest rates, planning and zoning regulations. The Reserve Bank of Australia has identified that up to a third of the costs of an apartment in Sydney come just from planning and zoning regulations alone. But the other one that comes at the expense of young Australians being able to buy a home is the complete economic perversion this parliament has sanctioned by prioritising superannuation ahead of homeownership. It's a form of economic insanity. Up until 1992, it was entirely logical—for literally the whole of human history up to 1992—that people saved for a deposit to buy their own home, started paying down their mortgage and built up other assets they could then save for their retirement. It was consistent with people's slipstream in life, completely consistent with securing their own home in order to be able to retire with dignity and surety and, of course, income, completely consistent with people's ambitions for the benefits that they enjoyed throughout their working life and their retirement. And then we changed that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This parliament and previous parliaments have literally sanctioned a form of economic social engineering to put super before homes. It's mad. What are the consequences? Young Australians are less in a position to be able to buy their own home, homeownership rates are declining for every single age group except for people over the age of 65 in the top economic quintile, the rich are getting richer, and the asset-rich are getting even richer. And who is paying the price? It's new migrants and young Australians. I think that's absurd.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want an Australia where everybody can realise their aspirations and their dreams. I want an Australia where everybody can move through the different stages of their life and the government is there to support them, not to deliberately and maliciously undermine them. I want an Australia where young Australians grow up with the ambition to purchase their own home and are able to. I want to support them and their families and provide them with the foundation of their economic security in their working life and in their retirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the whole path of human history until 1992 was home first, super second. But we know that has changed and now we put super before homes. It is mad. I know members of the Labor Party hate me saying it, because they know that Australians get this, too. You know who really gets it? It's young Australians who are struggling to save a deposit. What's the trade-off? Because we're putting super before homes, we're constantly increasing the taxpayer funded incentives to get young Australians into their first home, so we're publicly funding people's private purchase, privatising the gains and socialising the losses. Again, it's something the Labor Party and the Left used to oppose vehemently, and today it seems to be left to those on this side of the chamber to point out this self-evident, obvious truth. The more we pump into super, the more we have to pump into taxpayer benefits to enable young Australians to get into their own home, and they're actually similar in proportion to each other. This is how mad this policy is. You are literally using the tax system to underwrite people buying their own home, at the expense of the democratisation of both the ownership and the wealth distribution of the nation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At least we on this side of the chamber are prepared to stand up and call out this fallacy and say it's wrong. Look at the opposition benches, and all you will face is a wall of noise and anger and repudiation and a fight every step of the way because what they want is more money to go into the funds that their mates control at your expense—at the expense of the people of Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They think they know better. They've literally privatised huge sections of the social welfare system. They used to be opposed to that. Now on some points I agree with them and on some points I disagree. But the intellectual dishonesty and inconsistency that sits at the heart of their position is revealed by their motivations. They want to control the capital of this country and bring organised capital and organised workers together as part of a corporate estate, with big government and big business. They should hold their heads in shame.</span>

                    </a>  They scoff, yet every step of the way they know what they're doing. I don't mind their scoffing, because I am calling them out. It often takes years of people standing up and calling out people's behaviour before everybody realises how big the con and scam they're imposing on the Australian people is. They scoffed and mocked us before the last election, when we made the point that they were pushing older Australians down the financial stairs by taking their refundable franking credits and imposing a retiree tax. They scoffed and mocked and they tried to undermine anybody who would give a platform to lower income Australians who wanted to find their voice, including Australians with a disability who wanted to find their voice, who were going to be pushed down the financial stairs by the Labor Party. They tried to silence and censor anybody who would dare get up and speak out against them. Don't get me wrong—I was elated with their response, because all it did was give more voice, more power and more anger to the movement to make sure they sit on that side of this chamber. And they have not learnt the lessons.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A wave is coming to empower young Australians to be able to own their own home and to take control of their own destiny. I can tell you: on this side of the chamber, we will back it every step of the way, because at the heart of homeownership is the democratic ownership of this nation, at the heart of homeownership is the democratic wealth distribution of this nation, and at the heart of homeownership is the empowerment of citizens, families and communities to live out their lives. Those opposite criticise and condemn me and other members. As always, I say: bring it on. It comes from a fundamental mistruth at the heart of their mad political ideology. At the heart of their mad political ideology is the fact that they want a nation of dependence, not one of empowerment. They want a nation that empowers them, not the Australian people, and I will stand and fight it every step of the way.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:13</span>):  This bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (2021 Measures No. 4) Bill 2021, contains six Treasury measures, the most substantial being the one-year extension of LMITO, the low- to middle-income tax offset, for the 2021-22 income year, at a cost of $7.8 billion. This was announced in the budget, and it will mean that LMITO will end at the beginning of the 2022-23 financial year. Whilst Labor of course supports tax relief for low- to middle-income workers, the great shame about this measure is that it is temporary. It ends at the end of this financial year. Contrast that with high-income earners—those who are earning above $180,000 a year—who will get a substantial tax cut from 2024 onwards, which is permanent. But if you're a middle-income earner, a hardworking Australian with a family, trying to make ends meet, you won't get a permanent tax cut at all under this government. You will continue to pay a relatively high rate of tax under this government. That is the great shame about this budget. It doesn't deal with the structural problems that we have in the Australian economy at the moment, and it certainly doesn't deal with the tax reform that we're going to need to set our nation up for the next 20 to 30 years of economic success.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, in recent years, on every conceivable measure, Australia has been going backwards. Real wages aren't increasing in Australia; in fact, they are falling. The budget papers baked that in over the forward estimates period; they admit that real wages are going to go backwards. Labour productivity, for the first time in Australia's history, has fallen under this government—no growth. Since labour productivity records were first kept, in the early 1990s, there has always been growth. Under this government? No. It goes backwards. Business investment, under this government, fell off a cliff after 2014 and hasn't recovered. We have the third-highest level of household debt of any nation in the OECD and it's getting worse—house prices are once again out of control under this government. Not a week goes by in the community I represent that a parent doesn't pull me up and say, 'How are our kids going to be able to afford to buy a house in the future?' This government's solution is to bring in all these first home buyer grants that simply pour fuel on the fire. Any real estate agent will tell you that, in the 12 months after one of these schemes is announced, house prices go through the roof once again. Increasing wealth inequality is a characteristic of this government. The haves are doing better and the have-nots are doing worse.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hospital waiting lists are exploding once again because this government isn't making the necessary investments in health funding to keep pace with the growth in our population. Any nurse working in an emergency ward in a hospital will tell you they are run off their feet. When nurses are leaving the profession because they have had enough—particularly in hospitals—they are not being replaced, because of budget cuts associated with this government not providing growth funding for our healthcare system. We all know what a joke aged care has become under this government. There are hundreds of thousands of people on waiting lists for aged-care support.</span>

Isn't that something to be proud of as an advanced nation! Under this government we go backwards and backwards and backwards and backwards; we get worse and worse and worse. If you live in a rural or regional area it is archaic; it is almost like the days of dial-up, trying to get decent NBN and internet speeds. Investment in research and development has also gone backwards under this government.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Job insecurity is increasing. And today we have confirmation in economic terms of how Australia is going backwards, with a report released by the Productivity Commission confirming that living standards have fallen under this government to the value of about $11,000 per person. People were better off in the years of the Hawke and Keating governments, when we had that necessary economic reform—in particular, taxation reform—that set us up for the almost 30 years of uninterrupted economic growth that Australia enjoyed. It was those decisions of the Hawke and Keating governments that set us up for the success we have enjoyed economically for the past 30 years.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Does this government's budget deal with any of the challenges I have just mentioned? No, it doesn't at all. It doesn't make the necessary structural changes to our budget position to set us up for the future. We know that spending is increasing under this government. Spending under our budget is increasing, yet revenue is falling. The end result of that is that budget deficits are going to get worse. Under this government, debt is going to go to $1 trillion for the first time in our nation's history. Are they dealing with any of those structural problems in our budget to, importantly, provide funding so that Australians get the necessary health care they deserve, the necessary aged-care support that they deserve, and so our kids have the best opportunity of a decent education through proper school resources? Is any of that support for reform there in this budget? There's not one iota. In that respect, it means that Australians are going backwards.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to Australians being worse off, look no further than what's going on in this parliament, as we speak, in the Senate. This government has done a dodgy deal with One Nation on superannuation. They are changing the rate of the high-income superannuation concessional contributions cap for everyone aged 67 and over. I note the age of 67. I'll tell you why in a moment. Under this dodgy deal that the Morrison government has made with Pauline Hanson's One Nation, people who are higher income earners and aged 67 and over will pay less tax on their superannuation contributions to about the value of $30,000. It equates to a pay rise for politicians. Have a guess how old Pauline Hanson is? You can't make this stuff up. Pauline Hanson is 67 years old. Can you believe it? You greedy buggers. You've done a dodgy deal with One Nation to give yourselves a $30,000 pay rise on your superannuation and dudded the rest of the Australian workforce so that you can get your superannuation legislation through on a dodgy deal with someone who's only looking out for her own interests, because she's 67 years old and will get a $30,000 pay rise on her superannuation contributions. What a disgrace you lot are! How dare you do that to Australian workers who work hard and struggle to make ends meet and deal with the cost of living. You have no shame whatsoever. And you're trying to sneak it through the Senate under the cover of darkness.</span>

                    </a>  I hope that the Morrison government can explain to Australian workers the arrangement that's been reached with One Nation in the Senate. Australian workers deserve an explanation of why this government has reached an arrangement with One Nation to give politicians who are 67 and over a $30,000 pay rise whilst Australian workers are worse off in their superannuation arrangements because of this deal that's gone through the Senate. It leaves Australian workers, once again, worse off under this government. That's the point that I've been making about this particular piece of legislation and others that are passed by this government in respect of the budget—that they leave low- and middle-income, hardworking Australians worse off. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The low- and middle-income tax offset is proof of that. It's a temporary arrangement that is withdrawn, under this legislation, at the end of this financial year. Yet high-income earners will receive a permanent reduction in the amount of tax that they pay. It just demonstrates this government's priorities when it comes to the Australian workforce and to decent, hardworking Australians: they're not on your side; they don't have your interests at heart. All they're concerned about are themselves and people like Senator Hanson, who's managed to convince the government to make her financially better off. The collateral damage in that arrangement will be Australian workers.</span>

Adopted in February last year, our inquiry received more than 200 submissions and held five public hearings last year. We heard that, at the 2016 census, the ABS found 116,427 people were classified as being homeless, under that definition—an increase of more than 14,000 over five years. The increase among older women was as high as 31 per cent. In my view, it's clear that, in relation to older women, this is an underestimate. In 2014 a study by the General Social Survey found that 2½ million Australians have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives. Specialist homelessness services agencies report that, in 2018-19, there were 290,300 clients who sought assistance.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Homelessness is affecting every community in this country, and, sadly, one of the most severely impacted groups identified by the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement is older Australians. This problem is not always visible in Australia, as so many of our homeless are couch-surfing or living in their cars, just to name a few situations. However, the consequences for hundreds of thousands of Australians are nonetheless very real. Those who are homeless have difficulty accessing the services that they need. They are at an increased risk of violence—including sexual violence—drug and alcohol use, mental and physical health problems and severe poverty. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want to pre-empt the findings of the committee, because that would be entirely inappropriate at this time. The evidence that the committee has heard during its inquiry tells me that there is a shortage of affordable housing options, and we need to do something about that. We need more available homes to reduce the rate of homelessness in this country. This government is investing more than $6 billion a year in supporting Australians with housing affordability. This includes around $4.6 billion in Commonwealth Rent Assistance to help eligible Australians to pay their rent and another $1.6 billion through the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement to states and territories. In the most recent budget, the government invested an additional $124.7 million for states and territories under this agreement, which will be available to use on capital works to bolster public housing stocks.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in the past six months we've seen the biggest stimulus to the construction of accommodation in a generation, with the advent of the government's $2.7 billion HomeBuilder program. This is the same HomeBuilder program that those members opposite, in particular the member for Rankin, said would never work. They shouted out from the opposition benches, 'HomeBuilder will never work!'</span>

                    </a>  In the past six months we've seen this program, the $2.7 billion HomeBuilder program, result in 133,000 applications to build new homes since the middle of 2020. In total, in the 2020-21 financial year, this will produce a record 137,170 detached housing starts, which is an increase of 34.2 per cent on the previous year. This is almost 17 per cent higher than the peak of the previous boom in 2018, according to the Housing Industry Association's national outlook. The effects will pour over into the next year, with the HIA anticipating that in 2021-22 it will be the third-strongest year on record, with another 121,000 starts. This is in an environment where those members opposite said, 'HomeBuilder will never work.' And yet it is proving to be one of the most successful stimulus packages that the building and construction industry in this country has ever seen.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is investing billions of dollars in increasing the accessibility of housing in Australia. However, there is more that we can do to support the availability of homes through regulation, and this bill will help to achieve just that. More than 75 per cent of older Australians want to stay in their own home. However, as they get older, larger houses can often become too much for an older person to look after. Meanwhile, many young families are unable to afford a house which is large enough for their needs. For society at large, the available housing stock could be increased if more three-, four-, or five-bedroom family homes currently being occupied by one older person or a couple could be made available to members of their wider families. In response to this situation, many families around Australia are now entering into what are known as granny flat arrangements. These typically involve an older parent transferring the ownership of their home to their adult child in exchange for the promise of care, support and housing as the parent ages. These arrangements can be a great outcome for everyone. They give older Australians the opportunity to continue living in their own homes but with more help to maintain and look after them. They allow young families to get access to larger homes, which can properly accommodate them at a time when rents are inaccessible to many.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For all of us, it makes more efficient use of larger properties and ensures that there is more housing stock available to others. When equitable and carefully codified, these arrangements can benefit everyone, and encouraging more such well-formed agreements will make an important difference to housing in this country. However, at present, these arrangements can have serious unintended consequences for older people. Most are not formalised in writing, meaning that the rights of the older Australian can be entirely at the mercy of the goodwill and the circumstances of their child's family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one or very few would enter into one of these arrangements expecting a relationship breakdown, the death of an adult or child, or a bankruptcy proceeding. More often than not, such eventualities are not included explicitly in any agreement. However, these things do happen, and when they do the older person who has given up their home can be left without any enforceable rights; worse, they can be left homeless themselves. Such issues are made more prevalent by the fact that few of these arrangements are written down and formally executed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that there are not many of us who want to enter into formal contracts with our loved ones. Most of us would like to believe that our family ties would be strong enough to see us through any challenge. There's an old lawyer joke, Deputy Speaker Andrews, which you would remember: 'Where there's a will there's a family member.' Nothing could be truer than that old adage. Others are concerned that in making a formal arrangement to transfer property they may become liable for capital gains tax. However, when issues of property, debt and taxation are involved, family ties can be powerless to stop the terrible consequences for too many older Australians. In other cases, sadly, children or their partners do not act with the benevolence that we would all hope for and expect, and the result can be ongoing elder abuse in the form of neglect or, very sadly, financial exploitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to encourage more of these arrangements to be formalised, in writing, to prevent these negative outcomes. At the same time, we need to encourage more of them to be entered into, to maximise the benefits that they can bring for all of us. The bill before us does just that, by amending the capital gains tax regulations to provide a targeted exemption for formalised granny flat arrangements. The bill will provide that no capital gains tax event will arise on entering into, varying or terminating a granny flat arrangement if it is properly formalised under the bill. By providing a specific exemption, the bill will ensure that taxpayers know that there will be no capital gains tax consequences for them if they transfer property in this way. There is, in short, no motivation to attempt to avoid a tax through an informal arrangement, if the arrangement is exempt from the tax, and every reason to ensure that your arrangement is properly and equitably formalised if it will grant a major tax benefit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This capital gains tax exemption will not only encourage more of these granny flat arrangements to be entered into but also incentivise construction of the additional accommodation within properties that are so often part of these arrangements. Parties to formalised arrangements will be able to build a granny flat, annex or extension where the older person will live, increase the value of their property, increase the housing stock available to all Australians, and not incur capital gains tax on that investment. This will be a significant driver for many families to take that step and realise those mutual benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When as society we face a problem as serious and complex as homelessness we need to use every tool at our disposal to make a difference. It is commendable that Australians have taken it into their own hands to innovate and create arrangements that can deliver such benefits—important benefits—to older Australians, young families and those in need of housing alike. We need to encourage these kinds of practical grassroots solutions. We need to make sure that they are safe and fair for everyone. This omnibus bill will bring positive change across our economy. However, schedule 3, in particular, will make a big difference to the challenge of housing and homelessness for older Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One element I haven't raised this afternoon is the importance of local government in this space. Housing and homelessness is principally the responsibility of the states and territories. The Commonwealth government also has a role to play, but very often local government is left out of the equation. This is a part of the equation where local governments can play a very, very important role. Many local governments do not allow a secondary dwelling to be built on a property. In instances where we have housing shortages and increased costs for many young people, this bill will provide a sensible measure to deal with this issue but it will really only work if local governments get on board the bus, if you'll pardon the pun. Local governments need to be able to step into the breach here. Many local governments—and my local government on the Sunshine Coast is an example—seem to have a philosophical problem with secondary housing, or granny flats or whatever you like to call them. Local governments across Australia can play a very, very important role in dealing with housing and homelessness but they need to step up to the plate. It's not going to cost them any money. They will receive funding through applications for approvals. There is no reason why local governments should not be a part of and have a seat at the table in dealing with housing and homelessness. I call upon local governments to get on board and work with the federal government on this very point. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  I'm very pleased to be joining the debate on the treasury laws tax arrangements and issues that concern the economy and households' savings at large. In the last 24-hours, we've seen an extraordinary passage of events in this parliament where the government was willing to collude with Pauline Hanson's One Nation party to do a deal—an extraordinary deal, an immoral deal—to push through changes to superannuation administration and regulation in this country which have been trouble plagued from the start. They are changes that were so problematic that they threatened to see a revolt in the government's own backbench.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before parliament broke up last week we saw the result of that. The government—after spending weeks and weeks telling its backbench and the crossbench that its bill was perfect, was ready to be voted on and should be passed through the House—had to introduce amendments into this place to remove the extraordinary provision which would have given the Treasurer the power to cancel private sector investments. The Treasurer at that point in time had promised key members of the National Party backbench that he had removed the provisions which were so offensive to them and to so many other members in this place. What he didn't tell them was that, while he had put a padlock on the front door, he had left the back door wide open to enable him to continue that very same power through a backdoor measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has consistently pointed out this issue to the community, to backbenchers of both the government and the opposition and to crossbenchers. Still the government persisted, by saying, 'We've got this all right. You should trust us. You should believe in what we say. You should believe the materials that we've put before the House.' But it was revealed in the Senate this morning that nothing could have been further from the truth. The government backbenchers can't trust or believe what they're own government tells them and brings before the House, because another raft of amendments had to be moved to that bill. And it is still not fixed.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what was most extraordinary was the proposition that was being put forward by Pauline Hanson's One Nation that we know the government had agreed to, which would have had the effect of providing a whopping big tax cut, effectively a pay boost and a superannuation boost, to certain government MPs and senators of a particular age, and particularly remuneration arrangements which would have benefited Senator Hanson herself. They were extraordinary. In the Treasury bills and the budget initiatives that are being debated before this House, these matters were being contemplated. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's incredibly important that the House take note of these issues because, while we are debating laws to implement budget decisions in this House, there are, around budget measures, a range of deals that are being put in place which are very, very wrong—very, very wrong indeed. I want to draw the attention of members of this House to these matters as we debate bills which implement budget measures in this place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The shenanigans that have gone on in the Senate around the superannuation bills are nothing less than extraordinary. Fancy this—that, at a time when we've got flatlining wages and when economic growth is not delivering the productivity enhancements that we need to bring us forward as a nation, to deliver real wage increases and living standard increases for ordinary Australians, the government thought its No.1 priority was to do a deal with Senator Hanson which would have boosted the pay packets of politicians and high-wage earners but leave unattended all the problems in superannuation administration. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give you an example. In the government's budget measures, they said that they intended to do something to ensure that Australians were not forced to be members of underperforming funds. And we know, because the Productivity Commission has told us, that there are in excess of three million Australians who at the moment have their money in underperforming superannuation funds charging higher fees and delivering low outcomes, and it could be costing those Australians as much as $230,000 in lost retirement savings. So we have this problem identified by the government—the underperformance of funds, and Australians overpaying fees—but dealing with that issue was not their No. 1 priority; it was attempting to do a very grubby deal with Pauline Hanson's One Nation to get an imperfect bill through the parliament. The House should take note of these issues as we are debating these Treasury laws amendment bills which introduce budget measures. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, schedule 6 of this bill, which extends the low- and middle-income tax offset, enjoys our full support. But we do note in passing that this provision, which provides a tax offset of up to $1,080, is a temporary measure, yet the government in its budget is persisting with its permanent tax cut for some of Australia's highest-income earners—another example of where this government has its priorities wrong. Whether it's superannuation or whether it's the provision of tax cuts to high-income earners, they have their priorities wrong and they're not focused on the big issues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the superannuation legislation was first introduced and debated in this House, we drew to the government's attention a range of significant problems if they were intent on implementing this budget measure. We told them that a bill which proposed to reduce the fees that people were being charged on their superannuation accounts was actually going to have the impact of increasing the fees, because administration fees were completely excluded from the measures within that bill. We pointed it out to the government. They denied it was a problem. Only because of Labor's strenuous campaign against this issue did the government correct that obvious flaw in their legislation. We pointed out to the government that the measures in the bill that they introduced in the House were going to have the effect of penalising superannuation funds that used Australian workers' superannuation funds to invest in Australian infrastructure and Australian unlisted assets. Fancy that—a provision which actually penalises superannuation funds for using workers' money to go to work for the benefit of the nation and the benefit of those workers. But that's exactly what this government's bill did.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They included within the bill—which still existed until 25 minutes ago—a provision which we have called 'the investment kill switch'. This was a provision which made the Treasurer the superannuation trustee-in-chief. It gave him an extraordinary power that has never existed in this Commonwealth before, a power to cancel any private sector investment of a superannuation fund that he did not like. They persisted with it, after telling their own backbench that they'd fixed it, until we were able to shame it out of them in the Senate, not 25 minutes ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are important measures, because we are debating a bill which deals with the implementation of budget measures, and we have reason to be concerned about the government's intent and competence when it comes to implementing budget measures. I've addressed schedule 6 of the bill, which deals with the low- and middle-income tax offset, a provision which we support. In fact, we will be supporting each of the schedules within this bill, but we have grave concerns about the government's capacity to competently administer the provisions within this bill, because we have seen so many examples in this parliament in the last 24 hours of the government's incapacity to competently manage the implementation of budget measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I return to the superannuation measures, which are also included in budget measures. They are persisting with a piece of legislation which will staple members to dud funds. They say they want to fix the problem. We've provided a mechanism for them to fix the problem, but they have refused to implement this measure. So we have many reasons to be suspicious about the government's capacity to competently and honestly implement the measures that are before the parliament today in this session, because of the actions and the inactions of the government in so many other areas of budget bill implementation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we won't be opposing this bill, we ask all members of the House, particularly members of the government backbench and members of the crossbench, when other budget bills come before the House, and the Treasurer or his representative stands at that dispatch box and says, 'Trust us; these bills do what we say they are going to do,' to be very suspicious indeed. If they can tell untruths to their own backbench and to the crossbench about the content and the administration of superannuation bills, then there is no limit to the capacity of this government to tell untruths about other budget implementation bills. We'll be supporting this bill, but we'll have a lot to say about other bills which implement budget initiatives, because we simply do not trust this government's ability to do what it says it's going to do and for its legislation to implement the announcements that the government says that it intends to do. With those comments, I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282986" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALLEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:53</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (2021 Measures No. 4) Bill 2021. This bill addresses a number of tax issues and introduces the continuation of the low- and middle-income tax offset, an offset that has been so important during the time of COVID and has been widely welcomed right across Australia, including, of course, in my seat of Higgins. I know that many of my constituents have been waiting anxiously for this offset to take effect, in light of the financial strain that they've experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns and restrictions imposed on all Australians and most particularly in my state of Victoria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was delighted to hear that approximately 65,700 taxpayers in my electorate of Higgins will benefit from tax relief of up to $2,745 this year. In fact, the Treasurer, the Hon. Josh Frydenberg, joined me in Higgins and met with two of my constituents—Amy, a kindergarten teacher, and Darren, a small business owner—who have their first child on the way, and they are looking forward to the extra tax relief that this bill will offer. In fact, Amy told me how she will use this money to help set up the nursery for her baby—an exciting time of life which can be tempered by the extra costs of having another mouth to feed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also supports business by providing an additional fringe benefits tax exemption, by supporting consumers of financial products through additional ASIC oversight and, finally, by protecting our elderly population from potential exploitation through exempting granny flats from capital gains tax. So there are many measures in this bill, and I'd like to talk through several of those this morning. But first I'd like to say it is so important to support each and every Australian through the ongoing COVID-19 economic recovery and help them to further our economy—after all, our economy is built on the hard work of each and every Australian—and the amendments in this bill aim to do exactly that. We're providing additional support to taxpayers through extension of the highly popular low- and middle-income tax offset. That will help to free up their resources, which will help to stimulate the economy and lead to greater opportunities and prosperity for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, these tax initiatives will also protect one of our most vulnerable cohorts, our older Australians, from the financial and elder abuse often associated with what is commonly known as granny flat arrangements. Protecting a granny flat arrangement by way of removing the CGT implications will have the added bonus of allowing ageing Australians to age at home longer, surrounded by their family and loved ones. That's something we should all welcome. We know Australians are choosing to age at home and that this is their preference. That is what our government does; it listens to the needs of the very people that we represent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 is about FBT exemptions for retraining. The fringe benefits tax exemption to support retraining and reskilling provides an exemption for employer-provided retraining and reskilling. Currently, fringe benefits tax is payable if an employer provides training to employees that is not sufficiently connected to their current employment. This measure will benefit any employer providing retraining benefits to redundant or soon-to-be redundant employees. The employer can apply this exemption where a redundant employee is redeployed to another area of their business or where the new employment is outside their business. The exemption will be available for university, vocational education and non-vocational educational training courses which support redundant employees in finding new employment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If there was one word that everyone thought about in 2021 besides the word 'COVID', it would be the word 'pivot', and that is why I support this schedule—because it is so important that, as people go through the changing world that we're seeing both post COVID and as we move into the 21st century of the knowledge economy, we need to help people to retrain, reposition and pivot to the new world of work. This measure will support the government's skills reform agenda and current programs and assistance for education and training. The government's continued investment will support apprenticeships, create jobs and boost the skills of Australians to help them get back to work, because, as we know, the dignity of work is something that we value very highly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 provides a targeted capital gains tax exemption for granny flat arrangements where there is a formal written agreement. CGT consequences are currently an impediment to the creation of formal and legally enforceable granny flat arrangements. The Australian Law Reform Commission released a report in 2017 which examined elder abuse in Australia. We all are going to grow old—hopefully; the alternative is not worth thinking about. But we all want to know that we can age with dignity and grace and we all want our relatives and our friends who are older not to be the victims of elder abuse. The Australian Law Reform Commission examined the prevalence of elder abuse in relation to granny flat arrangements in particular. This schedule in the bill is an incredibly important one with regards to these arrangements. When faced with a CGT liability, families often opt for informal arrangements, which can lead to financial abuse and exploitation of older people. This amendment ensures that CGT consequences are not an impediment to formalising granny flat arrangements and seeks to reduce the risk of financial abuse and exploitation of older Australians and other vulnerable people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measure has extensive support from stakeholders, because this schedule has been extensively consulted about and there has been extensive public discussion of the processes. In a typical case, granny flat arrangements occur when an older person transfers some sort of consideration, often title to property or proceeds from the sale of property, to their adult child in exchange for the promise of ongoing care, support and housing. These arrangements can be beneficial to all parties; that's obvious. When operating effectively, they can provide benefits to the adult child in the way of property or funds and to the older person in the way of care, support and housing. However, the older person tends to be in a more vulnerable position and can suffer serious consequences if circumstances change. Problems can arise as a result of the adult child predeceasing the older person, relationship breakdowns between the adult child and their partner, or the adult child becoming bankrupt. Contingencies are often not considered for these types of events happening. This, combined with the common informality of granny flat arrangements, can make it difficult for the older person to establish, assert or enforce their rights under the arrangement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perceived tax consequences are one barrier to parties having a formal granny flat arrangement in place. CGT events could arise on entering into, varying or terminating a granny flat arrangement, depending on the circumstances. Informal arrangements can make it easier for a taxpayer to argue that there are no formal rights in existence and, therefore, no assets that could be subject to CGT. With these amendments, a CGT event does not happen on entering into, varying or terminating a granny flat arrangement if certain requirements are met. These requirements include that the individual having the granny flat interest has reached pension age or has a disability. In the days of the NDIS, these sorts of arrangements are really very important. The arrangement needs to be in writing and not be of a commercial nature. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The intent of this measure is to encourage the formalisation of granny flat arrangements to support the stable and long-term housing arrangements of older people and people with disabilities and to reduce the risk of financial abuse or exploitation. We all know families where there is a child with a disability. Parents worry about the long-term sustainable future of their children, and these sorts of amendments will be helpful in sorting these issues out. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to schedule 4 of the bill, there will be an amendment to the product intervention regime to address unintended consequences and to ensure that the product intervention regime operates as intended. A product intervention order is an order made by ASIC under its product intervention powers to impose conditions on or, if necessary, to ban potentially harmful financial and credit products where there is a risk of significant detriment to retail clients or customers. Removing ambiguity and ensuring that ASIC has the ability to intervene in relation to the costs of a financial and credit product—such as administrative fees, interest charges, surcharges or default fees—paid by a retail client or consumer through the use of a product intervention order is critical for retail client and consumer protection against significant detriment. Again, this is an important safety net to ensure that, as we go through a post-COVID recovery, we don't find people becoming more financially vulnerable. Importantly, this also increases consumption investment as a result of greater uptake of worthy financial products due to increased confidence and trust. The taxpayers of Australia need to be able to trust and respect our financial institutions and the products that they develop. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill provides tax relief to those who need it most. I'm very pleased that schedule 6 will come into effect, once this bill is passed, to provide a low and middle income tax offset. This bill will create $7.8 billion in tax cuts to around 10.2 million low- and middle-income earners by retaining the low and middle income tax offset for the 2021-22 income year. The low and middle income tax offset is worth up to $1,080 for individuals and $2,160 for dual-income households and is paid on assessment once taxpayers lodge their tax returns. It's something to keep in mind. Retaining the low and middle income tax offset in 2021-22 will support household incomes as the economy continues to recover. I know this has been a very popular COVID measure, and I'm very pleased that it's going to continue into this next year. As we emerge from COVID it is an important period of time with regard to our growth and development. And as we see the vaccination rolling out across the country I'm very pleased that we're moving to a post-COVID recovery—but we're not there yet, and we need to continue to provide the support that is needed by those on low and middle incomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill provides tax relief to those who need it most—low- and middle-income earners—at a time when they need it most. The bill goes further by helping employees and businesses alike to incentivise retraining and upskilling, and it protects consumers from low-quality and poor-value financial products. It also provides more certainty to often elderly or disabled Australians in order to make the most of granny-flat arrangements without needing to worry about the CGT implications. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="129164" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:06</span>):  I'm pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (2021 Measures No. 4) Bill 2021. This bill contains several Treasury measures. I won't go into the detail of each, but I do want to speak on the most substantial measure, which of course is the one-year extension of the low and middle income tax offset for the 2021-22 income year, a measure that provides a tax offset of up to $1,080 for incomes of up to $126,000. To be clear, Labor supports and has always supported tax relief for low- and middle-income earners and will facilitate the passage of this bill. But it has to be said that this Liberal government has once again delivered a bill that looks great on paper but fails the pub test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure it is just a happy coincidence for the government that the extension of the measure for another year means that the government can avoid the question of when to cut the measure until after the next federal election. When the Treasurer announced the extension of this measure he made it very clear that Australians should not expect it to become a permanent feature of the tax system. He emphasised, in fact, that it was 'a stimulus measure to support the recovery of our economy'. I want to be very clear about what the Treasurer is saying. He is saying that tax relief for our low- and middle-income earners is temporary, that it does not last. It's been extended for just long enough to see the government through the next election, after which many millions of Australian workers will pay more in tax than they do today. But the government has said that the vast bulk of the tax relief coming into the budget over the next few years is permanent. Isn't it funny that the vast bulk of permanent tax relief just happens to benefit the highest income earners in Australia?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why doesn't the government flip it? If it really wants to look after low- and middle-income earners, why not make this tax offset permanent and make the tax cut for high-income earners temporary? Why not make that dependent on the future economic performance of the economy? Why not say to high-income earners—the people in this place, the judges and others who are on hundreds of thousands of dollars a year—'Look, we'd like to give you a tax cut, but maybe the economy can't quite afford it. How about we give you a temporary tax cut for now, because we want to make sure that the low- and middle-income-earning Australians in this country get a permanent tax cut'? Wouldn't that be a better solution? I think it would be. But they can't help themselves on that side. Just to reiterate: tax relief for low- and middle-income earners is temporary; tax cuts for high-income earners are permanent. That's the message from this government: we look after our mates and make sure high-income earners stay on top. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you're a low- or middle-income earner this government is happy to provide relief—temporary relief—on the proviso of re-election. It's further proof that this government's most recent budget is about getting through an election rather than helping people with the cost of living and setting up the economy for the long term. Wages are stagnant. Real wages are going backwards; the Treasurer has told us as much. Even before that, we had the former finance minister, Mathias Cormann, telling us low wages were a deliberate feature of the government's economic architecture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While Labor supports this bill it must be noted that, while tax relief for low- and middle-income earners is temporary, the vast bulk of incoming tax relief will overwhelmingly benefit high-income earners and that will be permanent. It can't be stressed enough. It has to be stressed that they're only looking after low- and middle-income earners on a temporary basis but they're looking after the wealthy on a permanent basis. It must be understood that Australians on an income below $88,000 a year will be worse off under the Prime Minister's stage 3 tax cuts compared to what they are under with the low and middle income tax offset. Wage earners will be worse off—cleaners, clerks, teachers, paramedics, aged-care workers and nurses will all be worse off. Some of the people who have done the heavy-lifting through the COVID-19 pandemic will be worse off after next year while high-income earners will pocket thousands extra on a permanent basis. Seven in every 10 Australian workers will be paying more tax than they do today—and all from a coalition that trumpets sound economic management as a key strength. What an absolute joke!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's hurting people in my state the most. In my electorate, workers earn the lowest average income in the country. Tasmanians earn the least among all states and territories. That means even more of my constituents will be hit by the Morrison government's tax grab when this tax offset goes away. Isn't it bad enough that we are already facing a housing crisis, stagnant infrastructure funding and a shortage of general practitioners in regional Tasmania? Now low- and middle-income earners in Tasmania, after the next financial year, face the prospect of higher taxes. We've got thousands on the government emergency housing list, a healthcare sector in disarray and parts of our east coast cut off by a mismanaged highway closure. My state is doing it tough. So how can the Morrison government justify tax policies that will harm our most vulnerable in the long term?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports this bill because it provides support, albeit temporary, to the Australians who need it most. We've always supported putting more money in the pockets of workers and we always will. Labor has said all along that the priority for tax relief is that it should be going to the people who need it most and who are most likely to spend it in the economy. Tax breaks for middle-income-earning Australians and low-income earners are a good thing. These are the people who spend money going to the beach on the weekend with their families. These are the people who buy a pie and a drink at the footie on a Friday night. They buy new cars and, when they can afford it, do a reno on their house. They spend money in their local economies; they keep the money churning around. It's not the same when you give tax breaks to high-income earners; the money is not spent in the same way. It gets invested, sometimes offshore. It doesn't benefit the local economy in the way that putting more money into the pockets of low-income earners does. It doesn't have the same benefit to the economy at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Low- and middle-income earners are the people who, by spending money on themselves and their families, reinvigorate our economy—and nowhere more than in regional communities. These are the people this government is going to tax more when this tax offset ends after 2021-22. It beggars belief. The Morrison government is committing tens of billions of dollars in tax cuts for the highest-income earners while offering limited support for the average Australian family to get them through the election. Not only has this government racked up $1 trillion in debt with precious little to show for it in terms of long-term economic reform; they are prioritising high-income earners with long-term tax relief while taking the average Australian income earner for a ride.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has to be said, this is not just related to the bill before the House. The shadow minister mentioned before what's going on in the other place, right now, with superannuation and how that's going to hurt Australian workers as they head into retirement. This deal the government has done with One Nation beggars belief. It's absolutely appalling for Australian workers who are nearing retirement. Judas Iscariot got 30 pieces of silver for betraying Jesus at Gethsemane. Senator Hanson's getting 30,000—</span>

                    </a>  I was talking about how this government's budget measures are not helping income earners, but I do take your point about getting back to the measures in this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill says everything you need to know about this government's agenda and its fiscal incompetence, and its mean-spiritedness towards low- and middle-income-earning Australians. This bill is exactly like the eighth budget handed down by this tired government. It's been designed with one goal in mind: re-election. Just do enough to get re-elected. Don't worry about the long term. Don't worry about what's needed for the country or the economy in the long term. Just do enough to get re-elected. Beyond the spin and the headlines, beyond our media addicted Prime Minister, we can see the government for what it really is: tired, out of touch and out of time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see a government actively lowering workers' wages while providing tax relief to the wealthy. We've seen penalty rate cuts. We've seen stagnant wages. We've seen no plan to lift wages. Now we see before us a bill that offers temporary tax relief. It extends temporary tax relief, for low- and middle-income earners, not permanent tax relief. We see a government attempting to implement policies that hit working families the hardest, and we see a government willing to smash the Australian way of life to boost the coffers of its highest-income-earning mates, the highest-income-earning lawyers, judges and politicians who are doing the best out of this government and its tax relief policies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember, this mates-rates deal for high-income earners has been pitched by the Treasurer as a stimulus measure to support the recovery of our economy, but it's one that benefits only the very highest-income earners permanently. It doesn't look after average wage earners permanently. They're left out in the cold to fend for themselves: flat wages, their super under attack and now only temporary tax relief. Not only is it unfair but it is risking the Australian values that we've all come to cherish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we do support this bill for the temporary tax relief it offers, let it be known that these temporary measures will not undo eight long years of record low wages growth, chronically high underemployment and a shameless disregard for the Australian values of fairness and equality.</span>

Schedule 1 of the bill will provide a fringe benefits tax exemption to encourage employers to provide retraining and reskilling benefits to redundant or soon-to-be-redundant employees. The amendments will benefit any employer who provides retraining fringe benefits to their redundant or soon-to-be-redundant employees. The measure supports the government's skills reform agenda and current programs and assistance for education and training.</span>

In conjunction with Australia's broader support for resources development, the junior minerals exploration incentive will help to open up new opportunities for the sector into the future.</span>

This is in respect of members of New Zealand sporting teams and support staff that spend an extended period of time in Australia to participate in league sporting competitions because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The measure ensures that the treatment of New Zealand sporting teams is consistent with the unique intent of the convention by relinquishing Australia's taxing right. This applies to income in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 income years only.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 6 to the bill retains the low- and middle-income tax offset in 2021-22. The tax offset is worth up to $1,080 for individuals and $2,160 for dual income households and is paid on assessment when taxpayers lodge their tax return. The government is delivering tax cuts to low- and middle-income earners to support household incomes and create jobs as the economy recovers. It is estimated that around 10.2 million taxpayers will benefit from retaining the LMITO in 2021-22, with the majority of the benefits delivered to those earning less than $90,000. This is on top of the $25.1 billion in tax relief flowing to households in 2021-22 that has been announced in previous budgets.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COLLINS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:23</span>):  I want to say at the outset that Labor will be supporting this bill. The Farm Household Support Amendment (Debt Waiver) Bill 2021 outlines the criteria for the waiver, preserves the four years of payment in every 10-year period, allows time for farm household allowance recipients to comply with their existing obligations and provides a definitive end to the BIR and the waiver process. I want to be clear that we are supporting this but we're concerned that the government changed this system back on 1 July 2020 and it's taken them this long to get in here and to do something about the waiving of debts that were calculated under the previous system. Of course, we've seen from this government how it deals with people that owe debts to this government. We've seen it through robodebt. I'm actually going to move an amendment to this. I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes the Coalition Government's failure to adequately address the challenges facing farmers and its mishandling of the debts of recipients of government support payments".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to make sure that the government does the right thing by all of those that owe debts to the government. They need to be transparent about those debts and they need to be transparent about whether they're robodebts or farm household debts. They need to be absolutely clear and they need to treat people the same regardless of the type of payment that they're on when they're dealing with debts owed to the Commonwealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we saw with robodebt was a complete disgrace by this government. Those opposite knew those debts were illegal, and they did nothing about it until it was taken to court. The government should have responded to it. For literally years we have been talking about the terrible impact it has had on people. This government has also known that its complicated assessment for the farm household allowance has been a problem for years. It has already waived some debts from 2014-15, but this bill goes back and waives all the debts from 2015 up until the new system came in, on 1 July 2020. We will be supporting that, but we have some concerns, generally, about the way this government is supporting farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just through the payments and the systems that they're letting farmers down; it's also through the workforce. We know there's a labour shortage, and we've heard in recent days about this ag visa that the government say they will create.</span>

                    </a>  Yes, another thought bubble from the government! They promised this three years ago and of course have done nothing about it. Now we hear that it might be in place by Christmas. But how do you get workers here when the borders are closed because the government has done nothing about quarantine and has completely bungled the vaccine rollout? How are we going to get workers from overseas into this country when that is the issue? You absolutely cannot do that. These workers are not going to turn up for years; that's the bottom line. So what is the government doing in the meantime in terms of workforce on farms to help out our farmers in regional Australia?</span>

There's been absolutely nothing from this government to respond to the mouse plague, which is affecting four Australian states. It is estimated that it will inflict a billion dollars of damage, and yet they still do nothing over there—</span>

The bill provides for the waiver of certain classes of farm debt, and it's a reflection of the government's support for the agriculture sector in this country. A significant proportion of the Australian economy is agriculture. It was once said that we are a nation founded on the sheep's back, and agriculture continues to be an extraordinarily important part of our economy right across this country. This government will always back Australian farmers every step of the way. That is reflected in the fact that so many Australians from farming communities support this government and elect members of this government to this chamber to represent the interests of agricultural communities. That is something that we are deeply committed to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a nation, we should be very proud of our agriculture sector and of the tremendous export opportunities that the sector has. With the announcement this week of the Australia-United Kingdom Free Trade Agreement, we've seen further opportunities for the Australian agriculture industry to market its products to that very large United Kingdom market. It might be sugar in North Queensland, or it might be other consumable products that are manufactured right here in Australia using the very best Australian produce. A whole range of agriculture sectors within this country will benefit from this extremely important free trade agreement with the United Kingdom. It's something that we as a nation have been seeking to put in place for some decades after the previous retreat of the United Kingdom from a similar arrangement in the 1970s. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's just another manifestation of this government's deep commitment to the agriculture sector. We will always stand up for farmers. This bill, providing as it does for the waiver of debts in certain circumstances, is another example of that. This government can always be relied upon to stand up for our agriculture sector.</span>

Last Saturday, I stood with those workers outside the General Mills plant with the member for Chifley. The workers, who are trying to get a new enterprise agreement, are in a situation where, after long careers without ever having to take industrial action, have a company that, off the back of a bumper year, is refusing to offer them more than just over one per cent as a pay increase. This is a company that provides a whole lot of products that were bought in binge-buying in supermarkets last year, that had one of the most profitable years it will ever have and that had workers, at the height of the pandemic, turning up every day, making sure there was food for Australians. And yet, when it comes to sharing any of that profit with the workers, it's run a mile.</span>

When I got to 25 years, there were still hands up. We're talking about fewer than a hundred people, but they're people who are being ripped off badly by a company that has benefited from its work in this country. These workers deserve better and they should know that we stand with them.</span>

General Mills is one of the largest food-manufacturing companies in the world, boasting brands such as Old El Paso and Latina Fresh. What they also boasted last year was a record $2 billion profit—profit built off the back of their workforce, including their 150 workers at the Rooty Hill factory. And these workers had our backs during the pandemic. When the shops were struggling to keep up with demand, these workers went to work—when many of us were working from home—to help meet this demand. It's only right that General Mills have their backs now. The workers' wages have stagnated. All they want is a pay packet that keeps up with the cost of living, to help support their own families. They also want to protect hard-earned redundancy conditions and ensure secure jobs for all workers.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  It's show time in the Dawson electorate. Today is show holiday in Mackay. On Sunday I was at the Pioneer Valley Show and tomorrow I will be opening the Proserpine Show. Thousands of families and excited kids will be flocking to the showgrounds for the first time in two years, to grab a show bag, enjoy the fun rides, play the games and, of course, chow down on the highly nutritious dagwood dog. Sadly, shows were cancelled last year due to the pandemic restrictions. This left the Mackay Show Society and many others without any income and facing a future of financial uncertainty. Thankfully, the Morrison Liberal-National government stepped in and provided $70,000 to the Mackay Show Society to ensure the show could take place in 2021 and beyond. Another $15,000 went to the Bowen Show Society, $41,000 to the Proserpine Show Society and $70,000 to the Pioneer Valley Show Society.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This funding was made possible by the $34 million Supporting Agricultural Shows and Field Days Program. The importance of keeping these annual shows going should not be underestimated. They provide opportunities for our farmers and other community members to showcase and celebrate what they do and what they do best. The show must go on, and I'm pleased to say that, thanks to the funding from the Morrison Liberal-National government, it certainly will, and with gusto.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  I rise to condemn the Morrison government's plans to expand the cashless debit card to all pensioners. Pensioners right across the country know this Prime Minister wants to expand the program and force all pensioners onto the card. This unfair plan will put 80 per cent of their pension on a card that will limit what they can spend and where they can spend it. Pensioners know that under the Liberals and Nationals everything will change. They will have to say goodbye to the roast dinner at their clubs and their pubs, and they won't be able to take out cash to buy birthday and Christmas presents for their grandchildren. Even buying a simple lotto ticket will be banned. This is insulting, it's demeaning and it's wrong. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know it's the Morrison government's plan because those opposite keep on talking about making it universal. They say, 'Let's have a conversation; let's roll it out.' Well, pensioners have a right to be very anxious, because the Morrison government is currently working with the banks to roll it out across the country. Make no mistake: this is all about privatising welfare. That's exactly what they're doing. Australians should not have their spending controlled by the government, not by this government. Labor stands with our pensioners, and we will scrap the cashless debit card because we know pensioners should not be forced onto this nasty, unfair scheme. Pensioners know you cannot trust the Liberals and Nationals when it comes to their pension. You can trust Labor. We'll fight this together. Labor is on your side. We will scrap the cashless debit card.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  Two years ago on 12 June, Hong Kong residents rose against the Chinese Communist Party's deception and oppression. Hong Kong was a vibrant city, exposing the lie that a Chinese society couldn't embrace democracy. This is why the CCP betrayed the 50-year agreement to protect 'one country, two systems', first, by seeking to impose an extradition treaty that would have left Hong Kong residents at the mercy of the mainland's politicised judicial system and, second, by imposing a national security law designed to outlaw dissent. Against threats, millions hit the streets, many knowing they had every part of their future to lose, so they fought knowing there was nothing to lose by standing up. Having stood side by side with protest leaders such as Joshua Wong, they understood that they were not fighting for a strip of land but for the freedom of people to choose their own destiny. Ferries powered from Kowloon to the island, filled with young residents singing anthems and chants of their liberation. Now many are in jail through unjust laws or are too intimidated into silence to have a future. Journalists were expelled and rule imposed from Beijing. At every turn, the CCP have shown they seek compliance. These daring souls had the courage to oppose an impressive pack that disempowered millions. Two years on, we commemorate their sacrifice and fighting on the front line. The fight against authoritarianism goes on. This is not a political contest; it is a moral one. We stand for free people everywhere. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  Greyhound Australia at Pinkenba, in my electorate of Lilley, employs 77 local workers, but their jobs are now on the line due to the policy choices of this Morrison government, specifically the Prime Minister's decision to axe JobKeeper before the vaccine was properly rolled out. He had only two jobs to look after this year. Vaccine rollout was one of them. He's failed to do so. He kicked off JobKeeper anyway, and now these 77 jobs are on the line. Two weeks ago I wrote to the Acting Prime Minister on behalf of Greyhound Australia, calling on him to expand the federal travel subsidy in lieu of reintroducing JobKeeper for tourism businesses that are still struggling to stay afloat. The response I got from the Prime Minister, just like when I asked him to help my aviation workers on the north side at Brisbane Airport, was: 'Aren't I already doing enough?' It made me think of the John Howard line 'Working families have never been better off.' 'Aren't I already doing enough?' No, you are not already doing enough. So I rise to tell the Acting Prime Minister: so long as these 77 jobs hang on the line in my electorate of Lilley because of your policy decisions, then, no, you are not doing enough. We still have this afternoon. We still have next week. We can legislate to expand the tourism subsidy to include tourism companies like Greyhound Australia, to protect local tourism jobs in Queensland and to protect 77 workers in Lilley.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  I rise today to recognise the importance of community halls, which are central to the small settlements around my electorate of O'Connor. On Saturday night, with former Albany mayor Alison Goode, I opened the new kitchen at the Redmond community hall. Redmond is a community of 205 people on the northern outskirts of Albany. With many Redmond residents, including progress association chair Dean Smart and Jan and Tammy Flett, I shared a wonderful meal cooked in the new kitchen. A $7,000 Stronger Communities grant has helped the hall maintain the social fabric of the community after the Redmond store closed in 2018. And that's not all for the hall. A playground and a new power system are on their way as part of the $580,000 of federal Drought Communities funding that the Albany council is investing in nine rural halls. Other halls to benefit are at Manypeaks, Elleker, Bornholm, Napier, Youngs Siding, South Stirling, Lower Kalgan and King River. From King River hall, Joan and David Watkinson popped into my office on Tuesday and updated my staff on their many activities there. These include an art bazaar, photography courses and mosaic classes. Albany's biggest hall of all is its town hall, built in 1888. Last month the city council met there for the first time since 1967, to commemorate Albany's 150th anniversary as a local government. The meeting was enabled by a recent refurbishment assisted by $215,000 of Local Roads and Community Infrastructure funding. I congratulate the rural community groups for their energy and the city for investing its federal funding into Albany's halls, both big and small.</span>

Billionaires pay politicians, but they don't pay their fair share of tax. We've seen, in stunning leaks from the United States, that billionaires don't pay their fair share of tax, and some don't pay any tax at all. When billionaires don't pay tax, we all have to pay for them. So it's either us or them, because, while tax law might be complicated, the morality is not. Emergency nurses are paying more tax than corporations owned by billionaires. The system is cooked. When people are starving, anxious, alone and afraid, these hoarders are hoarding wealth. They're out of control, and Australians are angry. The establishment parties are fighting to get their feet under the billionaires' table and take their donations, but we just get insecure work, wage cuts and rising costs on life's essentials. We don't accept that. We will fight for the future. We demand a tax on billionaires. We demand dental and mental health care in Medicare. We demand a guaranteed well-paid, secure job, an affordable home and a safe climate for all of us.</span>

The Carswells are an iconic local tennis family. Today I'd like to pay tribute to the matriarch of the Carswell family, Joan, who recently passed away at the age of 97. Born in Launceston on 15 April 1924, Joan was educated at Invermay Primary School. Her schooling was cut short when she developed the symptoms of polio, and her mother sent her to her family home in Kempton to recover. Joan eventually began her working life in the warehouse office of Patons and Baldwins in Launceston, before marrying husband Andy in 1944 and having three children. In the 1960s Joan became interested in tennis as a result of her children's enthusiasm for the game, starting out helping in the canteen before becoming the secretary of the City-Suburban Tennis Association and organising the popular pennant for many years. As part of the association, Joan was organising over 1,000 players a week during its prime, with over 137 teams, and the midweek pennant still continues today. Joan's decades of voluntary service were recognised by her induction into the Tasmanian Honour Roll of Women, and in 2000 she received an Australia Day citizenship award for her contribution to volunteering in sport. Joan's legacy lives on through her three children, David, Brian and Andrea; six grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. Vale, Joan.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blaxland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  Tonight, like every night, thousands of Australians will sleep on the street or in a park or in their car. And tonight 1,657 other Australians will also experience a bit of what that's like, because tonight is Vinnies CEO Sleepout. It's not the same thing as sleeping rough. I remember, the first time I did it, a bloke who had been sleeping rough for many years told me the worst part isn't the cold or the rain; it's the fear that you have when you close your eyes—that feeling of vulnerability that you might get robbed or bashed or worse. Tonight's not like that. We won't feel that fear. In the morning we'll go home, back to our families, back to our warm beds. But tonight is important because it will help to raise about $8 million for Vinnies to help Australians who desperately need our help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also important because it will help to shine a light on Australians who are too often forgotten: the 10,000 mums and kids trying to flee domestic violence last year who were turned away from refuges because there wasn't a bed, and the one in 10 people sleeping rough who are veterans—the people we train, send off to war and, despite everything we say on Anzac Day, are forgotten. It's a night to think about everyone left out in the cold. Nights like tonight also force us to ask some hard questions of ourselves. How is it that, in a country so wealthy, today there are more Australians who are homeless than ever before?</span>

I was pleased to learn this week that several Longman residents were recognised for their outstanding contributions in the Queen's Birthday 2021 Honours List with a Medal of the Order of Australia. The medal recipients in Longman included the Reverend Colin Baxter, who was recognised for his service to the Uniting Church in Australia and to the community. Henry Lynas was recognised for his decades of service to preserving community history and his contribution to the Fort Lytton Historical Association. James Pulsford received his award for services to conservation and the environment. James is a founding member of the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland and has been involved in many local environmental projects. Australian Army Corporal Mitchell Jon Howden received a commendation for gallantry in action while he was a section commander in the Quick Reaction Force Platoon, Task Group Taji X, in Iraq on 11 March last year. Wendy Sanders was recognised for her services to the cycling community and U3A. Wendy has managed cycling teams at a national and international level, taking three teams to Japan and France. And Martin White was recognised for his work with the Bribie Island Orchestra, a group he co-founded 27 years ago. Martin has also been an integral member of the Bribie Rotary Club and U3A. I thank you all for your contribution to our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  I rise today to acknowledge the resilience of Eden-Monaro farmers, who have battled through drought, survived devastating bushfires, dealt with multiple flooding events and found ways to adapt during the COVID-19 pandemic. We've seen the damage caused by the mouse plague in north-west New South Wales, and it's evident that this government isn't listening to farmers. Just yesterday the Acting Prime Minister skirted the issue. Instead of offering a real solution, he said that perhaps the mice could be 'rehomed into inner-city apartments to scratch their children at night'. How out of touch this government is if they think this is what farmers want. Farmers don't want the issues they are facing to be forced on other people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is ignoring the plight of our farmers. Monaro sheep farmers are worried about the future of the wool industry, with China purchasing around 70 per cent of Australia's greasy wool. With this government more focused on politics than proper strategy in our foreign policy, it's no wonder farmers are concerned. Farmers are struggling with workforce shortages. They can't find workers. Even when they can find workers, they are unable to find affordable places for them to live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ongoing CSIRO budget cuts mean it's harder to secure funding for agricultural research and development, which will hurt the agriculture industry into the future. They want funding committed to coordinator roles for farming cooperative groups, which band together farmers for research, marketing and administration. We know mice are a problem, but in Eden-Monaro farmers are doing it tough. This government needs to start listening to them and having their backs.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  I'm disappointed but certainly not surprised that Labor has again decided to mislead Australians about Medicare. Labor said the government would privatise Medicare in 2016. We did not. Labor said the government would make cuts to Medicare at the 2019 election. We did not. Again, in 2021, Labor is attempting to scare Australians in a move that reeks of political desperation. In fact, in the May budget, the Morrison government increased Medicare's funding by $6 billion over the budget cycle. This means that, in 2024-25, Medicare funding will have reached $33 billion—$14 billion more than when Labor was last in government. Bulk-billing rates are at a record high 88.7 per cent, meaning almost nine out of 10 visits to a GP are bulk-billed. This is 6.7 percentage points higher than when Labor was last in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we see Labor attempting to play politics with an independent review of the MBS, a process led by experts designed to modernise the MBS in a way that will actually benefit patients. In fact, this budget includes $711 million for new or amended items on the Medicare Benefits Schedule, including additional support for mental health services. The Morrison government has delivered an increase of funding to Medicare, a record bulk-billing rate and a Medicare guarantee. This is yet another routine 'Mediscare' campaign by those opposite in a bid to mislead and deceive the Australian public, and they should be ashamed of themselves.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  Once again, we are seeing the consequences of the Morrison government's failures on quarantine and the COVID vaccination rollout. In Sydney, a single person driving a flight crew from the airport to hotel quarantine has tested positive and started yet another outbreak. Once again businesses are being shut, staff are being sent home and thousands of people are having their lives disrupted. This comes as Victoria emerges from yet another lockdown caused by the Morrison government's failure to take charge of hotel quarantine and vaccinate the population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been in this pandemic for more than a year. The Prime Minister still can't get quarantine right and he still can't get vaccines right. Just six million of the required 40 million vaccines have been delivered. At the current rate, we won't be fully vaccinated until June next year. That's 12 months away. How many more quarantine breaches will we see in that time? How many more outbreaks will we see in that time? How many more lives and businesses will be disrupted? As Dr Teena Chopra from the Detroit Medical Centre told the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> yesterday, getting people vaccinated is the only way to end the pandemic. It is a race, Prime Minister, and Australians are paying a very, very heavy price for your failure.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  On Monday we celebrated the achievements of 1,190 remarkable Australians with the Queen's Birthday Honours. Each year, Bennelong is highly represented on this list, and I'm delighted to announce a further two worthy recipients from my electorate. Epping's Joanne Edwards was awarded a Public Service Medal for outstanding service to community health in New South Wales. Ms Edwards has played a critical role in the state's response to COVID-19. As state health emergency operations centre deputy controller she continues to assist in the management of hotel quarantine, border restrictions and the medical exemption process. In addition, she has worked closely with public and private pathology providers to provide testing clinics with hospitals to ensure they can meet demand should we see a surge of COVID-19 cases in New South Wales.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />Our second recipient was Chief Petty Officer Benjamin Ashley Smith. Mr Smith was awarded a Conspicuous Service Cross in recognition of his outstanding achievement during the introduction into service of the Hobart class destroyers. The three air warfare destroyers will be capable across the full spectrum of joint maritime operations from area air defence and escort duties through to peacetime national tasking and diplomatic missions. Chief Petty Officer Smith's technical expertise and training were instrumental in the development of the Hobart class destroyer capability. We proudly acknowledge his contribution to building Australia's defence— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  Yesterday, in this place, we witnessed what has to be one of the weirdest responses to a question time question I've ever heard. Even more bizarrely, it came from the Acting Prime Minister—yes, the person they've left in charge of running the country. When he was asked about federal government action, or lack of it, on the national mouse plague, which is now affecting four Australian states and is estimated to be costing a billion dollars in losses for farmers, we had the Acting Prime Minister say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">They should be rehomed into their inner-city apartments so that they can nibble away at their food and their feet at night and scratch their children at night.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what we got from the Acting Prime Minister yesterday. I kid you not! He wants to rehouse mice into inner-city apartments. It just goes to show the contempt with which that side of the House is treating farmers and the seriousness of this mouse plague. We have a Deputy Prime Minister, a member of the Nationals, who says the words 'farmers' and 'regional Australia' a lot but doesn't do much about helping them when they really need it. The New South Wales agriculture minister has asked the federal government for help. He's written to the government asking for help, yet the government is sitting on its hands and doing absolutely nothing about this mouse plague. We're talking a billion dollars in losses and four Australian states, and the national government is doing nothing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  Small COVID-19 leaks from quarantine can have dire population-wide effects. Just look at Victoria's recent two-week lockdown following a single case escaping from quarantine. If we want to make our quarantine system safer and avoid further outbreaks, building more facilities like Howard Springs is not the answer. Daily rapid antigen tests could give us the security we need. Rapid antigen tests use a test strip, like a pregnancy strip, that reacts to the presence of viral proteins in a sample swabbed from the nose. Results are available in minutes, not hours, as occurs with the gold-standard lab testing currently used for screening asymptomatic workers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />Slower PCR test results mean quarantine staff and people being discharged from quarantine may mingle in the community for hours before they know they are infectious. If staff or those leaving quarantine are moving around the community unaware that they are COVID-19-positive, this can result in catastrophic outcomes, such as community outbreaks. The almost immediate results of rapid antigen tests are attractive, given the emergence of new, highly infectious variants of concern, where it can be difficult for contact tracing to keep up with the speed of spread. Britain is already offering free rapid antigen testing to all citizens twice weekly. It is used for asymptomatic screening, followed up by gold-standard confirmation with lab testing. As we emerge from COVID, we need to look at alternative ways to quickly identify outbreaks. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  It's bad enough that the Prime Minister has been caught red-handed putting QAnon code words in important speeches, but the revelations that his close mate Tim Stewart has been house-sitting the official residence of the Prime Minister of Australia raises real security issues. Tim Stewart's own family reported him multiple times to the National Security Hotline, due to his dangerous beliefs and threatening behaviour. This man seriously believes that satanic, cannibalistic paedophiles run a global child sex trafficking ring that conspired against Donald Trump. This guy has the Prime Minister's ear. They text and Facebook as mates.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">QAnon is a dangerous cult that the FBI has declared a potential terrorist threat. Kirribilli House should not be an Airbnb for conspiracy theorists. How often has the Prime Minister let this dangerous man sleep over? What exactly is the nature of his relationship with Tim Stewart? Why has the Prime Minister refused to condemn the US Capitol riots? Why he'd want to hang out with people like this is beyond me, but his associations with these people are a matter of public interest and concern. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has nicked off to England to attend the G7. That's fair enough, but a legitimate official trip has now turned into a taxpayer funded pub crawl around the UK with his 20-person entourage. It's time he got off the beers, got on his plane home and came and explained himself to the Australian people in this parliament. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In particular, I acknowledge Associate Professor Edwina Wright, who was awarded a Member of the Order of Australia for her significant service to medicine and research—notably for people living with HIV/AIDS—as well as the following recipients of the Medal of the Order of Australia: Dr Santosh Kumar, for service to the Indian community; Ms Felicity Marlowe, for service to a variety of social welfare organisations; Mrs Kathleen Monley, for her service to the community, including important service to the welfare organisation Doncare in my electorate; Mrs Karen Pearce, for service to sports administration; Mrs Kathleen Rehe, for her service to tennis; Mrs Pamela Vardy, for service to horticulture and radio media; and Mrs Jacqueline Wright, for service to international health. I also congratulate Dr John Leaper and Mrs Jenny Leaper, who are the proprietors of the TLC aged-care homes, one of which is in my electorate at Donvale, for their award of a Medal of the Order of Australia. Finally, I would observe that none of us in this place, on any side of politics, would be able to function without the support of our staff, and I particularly congratulate my friend Peta Credlin for being made an Officer of the Order of Australia.</span>

We have at all points in this global pandemic made sure that we followed the best medical advice and did what a responsible government would do as far as the vaccination rollout is concerned, making sure we had the necessary funding to get the necessary doses out to communities, whether they were metropolitan communities or rural and remote communities. Last week the Victorian government confirmed that it had the necessary supply of Pfizer vaccines, including first and second doses, in that state's vaccine storage facilities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to increased rates of vaccination in Victoria, the Australian government has provided 1.5 million additional Pfizer doses and increased the supply of AstraZeneca to Victoria, from 26,100 to 41,100 per week, for a total of six weeks, for state hubs; a further 80,000 additional AstraZeneca doses for state clinics; and a doubling of AstraZeneca for all Victorian general practices. What that means is that the Pfizer supply to Victoria is about 104,000 each week and 133,000 for the rest of June, which includes a baseline delivery of 71,000 doses a week plus the 150,000 extra doses we're giving Victoria to get through this outbreak. In July, Victoria's baseline Pfizer doses will increase to around 83,000 a week, and Victorian GPs will receive 200,000 doses through the month.</span>

They've already travelled 24 million kilometres. We have the Royal Flying Doctor Service flying vaccinations to 80 communities, servicing 30,000 Australians in remote areas. We will continue to provide the vaccinations and we will continue to provide the necessary funding, whatever it takes.</span>

In the past 18 months, Australia has had to face many challenges to our way of life. We've had droughts, floods, storms, fires and a worldwide pandemic which has killed 3.8 million people across the globe. Through all the challenges we've faced as a nation, we've stayed strong and we've stayed together. I thank Australians for their resilience.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A year ago Australia entered a COVID recession, but the tenacity of Australians has seen us bounce back strongly. The unemployment figures out today are remarkable—down 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent. There are more people with a job today than there were prior to the pandemic. Real jobs are created through private enterprise and through businesses both large and small. It's the government's role to provide the confidence and the economic parameters around which businesses will succeed and employ people. </span>

                  </a>  I appreciate it is in your electorate, too, and it is also in the electorate of the member who asked the question, the member for Monash. The Commonwealth government will consider Mr Merlino's request for additional assistance. We will do that as quickly as possible. Assistance via funding, assistance via Australian Defence Force personnel, boots on the ground—we will do what is requested. We've already put in place and activated the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is an update on the dreadful storm. There are 7,000 homes in the Dandenongs without power for, potentially, a further three weeks. In Monash, the electorate of the member who asked the question, there is storm damage in Dumbalk, Fish Creek and Buffalo. In Gippsland, the Traralgon floods saw 87 homes with water across the floorboards. In Casey—your electorate, Mr Speaker—there are power outages in Ferny Creek, Kalorama, Mount Dandenong, Olinda, Sassafras and Upwey. I appreciate that the Dandenong Ranges and the Yarra Valley have been hit hard. I messaged the member for McEwen before question time, and I appreciate that he's been doing what he can for his people in the Macedon Ranges and, particularly, in the Lancefield region. I know the member for Ballart indicated earlier this week that her electorate has also been hit. Many areas of Victoria have been hit hard by the storms. We stand ready. I know there are many, many trees down, there's severe damage and many people are doing it tough at the moment. So we will, as a responsible Commonwealth government, as always, provide what assistance is necessary and needed, and we stand ready to work with the Victorian government to this end.</span>

There are approximately 815,000 Australians who have had a first dose of AstraZeneca and are waiting for a second. Some in this chamber will be in that circumstance. The advice, as provided both by ATAGI and the Chief Medical Officer, has been very, very clear: they should proceed with the second doses, as was the case when the previous advice was given. At all times what we have done—this has been one of the hallmarks of Australia's response—has been to follow that medical advice. There was the closing of the border with China and the difficult decisions in relation to the closing of the national border more generally. In particular, there was the selection of vaccines, which was based on the advice of the scientific and technical advisory group, led by Professor Brendan Murphy. We have followed all of their recommendations in terms of the source, the quantity and the application of the vaccines. The advice given just before question time, in writing by ATAGI and verbally by the Chief Medical Officer of Australia, is: if you have had a first dose of AstraZeneca, no matter what your age please proceed with a second dose unless there has been a significant adverse contrary indication. That is the same advice that was given to others at the time the 50-and-above age group was put into place. The reason why, as explained by the Chief Medical Officer, is that the global evidence is that there is a very, very low case level, right around the world, with regards to any adverse reactions to a second dose of AstraZeneca. I think that that hopefully addresses the question—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those on this side of the House welcome the fact that after the first recession in nearly 30 years the Australian economy is roaring back—an economy that is bigger, an economy that is stronger, an economy that is leading the world. Today we saw unemployment fall for the seventh consecutive month, to 5.1 per cent, smashing market expectations. Participation was up. Underemployment was down. In the month of May, 115,000 new jobs were created; 85 per cent of those new jobs were full-time jobs, and 60 per cent of the 115,000 jobs went to women. Today there are more women in work than ever before. This is what is happening with the Morrison government's plan to create more jobs across the economy; 987,000 jobs have been created since May of last year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the end of JobKeeper at the end of March, 84,000 new jobs have been created. We know that this backs off other significant and positive economic data, including the national accounts, which saw Australia ahead of any advanced economy in the world, with its economy bigger today than it was when the pandemic began. Dwelling investment is up, machinery and equipment investment is up and farm GDP is its strongest in seven years. We saw Standard &amp; Poor's reaffirm Australia's AAA credit rating and Australia being one of only nine countries in the world to have a AAA credit rating from the three leading credit rating agencies.</span>

We know that those opposite continue to talk down the Australian economy, whingeing and whining and denying the fact that the economic recovery under this Acting Prime Minister and under our Prime Minister continues to grow, from strength to strength. Those opposite have one economic policy, and that is $387 billion of higher taxes—and higher taxes will cost jobs. Under this government we have seen, yet again, the strength and the resilience of the economy, for which more than 25 million— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We had had informal discussions, because we had sought to commence them on the earliest possible date. Pfizer's advice to us was that they were not able, on the basis of the international rules, to commence negotiations. When that was lifted, we began those discussions in July. We followed the advice of ATAGI and we followed, in particular, the advice of the Scientific and Technical Advisory Group. We secured the earliest possible availability of doses on all the advice that I have. The advice of the Scientific and Technical Advisory Group was to secure an initial 10 million doses. There was no earlier available volume, to the best of my advice and knowledge. That remains absolutely clear and that's been the position throughout.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have followed that advice and secured 195 million doses of vaccine across five different platforms. What we have are 53.8 million AstraZeneca, which has provided the backbone of what occurred in Australia with over 500 million AstraZeneca doses delivered worldwide. It has, in fact, been the backbone of the UK program, to which the opposition refers from time to time. In addition to that, we have 50 million Novavax. We have 40 million Pfizer, all of which are on the latest advice that I have, due to be delivered in the course of this year. We have 10 million Moderna due to be delivered this year and 15 million next year and, in addition to that, access to 25½ million COVAXX.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that has been very important as we look at this is we recognise that the decision taken today is a cautious one. It compares with the position in the UK, where 40 and above can access AstraZeneca; in South Korea, 30 and above; in Germany, 18 and above, but they made it based on Australian circumstances. We followed that medical advice, as we have done scrupulously with the work of the Scientific and Technical Advisory Group, led by Professor Murphy, as to which vaccines should be purchased and on what basis. Every vaccine that we have purchased we have secured at the earliest possible time.</span>

I'm pleased to say, being a regional member, that regional Australia is playing a leading role in making sure that we have lower emissions. But we will always protect those resources industry workers. We will. I know the member for Hunter will. I'm not sure too many others on that—maybe the member for Paterson will too. We all, on this side, support those brave resources workers, those people who get on hi-vis, those people who put on a hard hat with a torch on the front and go down and dig up the resources that make for a better Australia, a more prosperous Australia. </span>

Like all members of this chamber, he's focused on making sure that the health of Australians is protected. As we look at a world with over two million lives lost this year, officially—potentially as high as five million, if you take the World Health Organization's assessment—and compare that with no lives lost to COVID in Australia from anybody who has caught COVID in Australia, that perspective, I think, puts the national public health achievement into a global context. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, of course, as was mentioned before question time, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation has updated its advice with regard to the access to vaccines in Australia. It has recommended that the AstraZeneca vaccine be made available to those who are 60 and over and that the Pfizer vaccine is the preferred vaccine for those who are under 60. They've done that on the basis of continuously assessing the medical advice. Indeed, I requested them to do that again last Thursday but we know that, in particular, they've been engaged in continuous assessment. So out of an abundance of caution, as I mentioned earlier, they have made those recommendations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are four responses, which the government has taken. Firstly, we will accept that advice. Pfizer will now be the preferred vaccine for under-60s and AstraZeneca for over-60s. Secondly, we will move to open access to Pfizer for the 40- to 59-year-olds, so the 50 to 59s are being added to that group. Then we'll move to increase access to that as the third item. That means, over the course of July, that up to 1,300 general practices and 136 Commonwealth clinics will be given access to Pfizer. That should begin on about 5 July, going forwards over that week, for up to 500 practices, up to a further 500 practices over the week of 12 July and up to a further 300 practices over the week of 19 July. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, supply for Pfizer will be increasing, and I think that's a very important element. What we're expecting is to go from, this month, approximately 1.7 million doses to 2.8 million over July, with the remaining 32.6 million doses to be delivered during the course of the year. All of these things are about ensuring that the rollout, which has seen over 6.2 million doses—over five million Australians and over 25.5 per cent of eligible Australians received that vaccine rollout. It's about keeping Australians safe and about following that medical advice, and by following that medical advice we have kept Australians safe and saved lives through this pandemic.</span>

That's why we are urging and encouraging all Australians, and indeed foreign crew who come into this nation, to make sure that they've got their jabs—to make sure they have their vaccinations. That's the whole point of it. That's the bottom line, particularly for people who are working in these frontline industries. Whether they're in the medical profession or whether they're in the transport profession, we want them to get vaccinated. It is so important to get that vaccination, when available, to keep themselves, keep their families, keep their communities and keep their workplaces safe.</span>

                  </a>  I remind the House that Australians pay more than $30 billion a year in superannuation fees and charges. That is more than they pay for their household and electricity bills. Our focus is about driving a better deal for Australians with superannuation. That's why we pursued policies and successfully implemented policies in this place to ban exit fees, to consolidate inactive accounts, to reduce fees on low-balance accounts and to make it optional to opt in to insurance in super for those who are under 25. Having passed the Senate, there is legislation coming to this place. We will debate this legislation to save consumers more than $17 billion on their super, to reduce their fees, to provide them with more choice and to introduce more transparency and accountability for the performance of funds, including preventing the creation of duplicate accounts. There are around 10 million unneeded and unwanted duplicate accounts. People's balances get eaten away by the fees on these duplicate accounts. What we want to do is introduce the Productivity Commission's recommendation to staple those accounts. We also want to enable Australians with super to be able to check the performance of their fund—looking at the fees charged and looking at the returns that are being earned on these super funds. We also want to introduce more accountability for the underperformance of poor-performing funds. That is in the best interests of consumers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was asked about alternative approaches. Those opposite took to the last election $34 billion of higher taxes on your super, preventing catch-up contributions for women who have been out of the workforce. That was their policy. On this side of the House, our policies are determined to drive down fees and charges for Australians with super and our policies are designed to improve the performance— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  He has asked the question. We want to encourage, obviously, all Australians to get that jab. It is so important. It is absolutely critical. Indeed, over the last seven days 731,660 people have got the vaccination; over the last eight days, 874,468; and over the last 10 days, 1.1 million. More than 60 per cent of people over 70 are protected with a first dose. More than 40 per cent of people over 50 are protected with a first dose. More than one in four of the eligible population aged 16 and over are protected with a first dose. In aged care, all 2,566 RACFs have received a first dose and 96.9 per cent of Commonwealth RACFs have received a second dose. In disability care, 9,718 NDIS participants in residential accommodation have received at least one dose. This is, as Professor Brendan Murphy said, the largest logistical exercise in Australia's peacetime history.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the opposition leader's point about the transport worker: we are happy to look into this particular case. Indeed, I'm happy to take any more information if the opposition leader has it. But the New South Wales state government has been the gold standard by which contact tracking and tracing has occurred. It has made every measure and effort to keep New South Wales safe. Indeed, that is how they have kept their state safe, just as we have ensured that we have kept this country safe. We're doing this in the most practical, responsible way, listening at all times to the best possible medical advice.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr ROBERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment, Workforce, Skills, Small and Family Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:32</span>):  I thank the member for her question and for all the hard work she does championing over 10,000 small and medium businesses in her electorate of Bass. I know that she and all those on our side of the House join the Treasurer in welcoming today's figures of unemployment at 5.1 per cent. In the last month, 115,000 Australians got a new job. That is extraordinary. There were 13,125,000 people employed, with 130,000 more people employed now than pre-COVID, a full one per cent. We are the only advanced nation in the world that can claim that. Importantly, we have seen underemployment, which is those people looking for more hours, decrease by 0.4 per cent to the lowest rate in 7½ years. All this is pleasing, as is the 69,400 women getting employed in the month in question. It is the highest number of women employed in our nation's history. All of this is great. It is good news, but there's more to do. I think we all recognise that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The important thing is that we've still got the highest number of job adverts in 12 years, which means there is enormous opportunity for Australians right now to continue to get skilled and continue to get in work. It shows that the Morrison government's economic plan is working, that the budget that focused on skills and on jobs and on backing in hardworking Australians is making a difference. It's why I was thrilled to hear from the member for Bass about Bronte Clinton, who runs Elysian Beauty &amp; Wellness in the Launceston CBD. It's been tough for Bronte—it's been tough for many businesses during the pandemic—but she has just taken on two new employees, including one new apprentice, leaning on and working with the Morrison government's boosting apprenticeship commencement wage subsidy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it's not just Bronte. 58,000 Australian businesses have taken on new apprentices—143,000 apprentices—which means there are a whole bunch of small businesses taking on one and two apprentices, be it Bronte and what she's doing there with hairdressing or be it in traditional trades and other areas. We've doubled down on that with $2.7 billion to extend the Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements to see another 170,000 apprentices extending through to March next year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />Now, we know there's still some more to do. There are still 700,000 Australians who remain out of work. There are still 1.1 million Australians on a primary payment. So we are committed to ensuring those Australians have every opportunity to be skilled from the budget we have brought down and every opportunity to get one of those jobs, considering we have the highest jobs availability in 12 years. I'd encourage every Australian business: take a crack and employ an Australian. There's never been a better time to employ Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We're all very proud of the work the Australian Defence Force does. We've seen over the course of the last two decades its involvement in Afghanistan and campaigns in the Middle East, which have directly resulted in a reduction in the number of terrorist attacks that otherwise would have taken place in our country and in other parts of the world.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, as we pivot to our region, to the Indo-Pacific, it is incredibly important that we continue to deepen relations with our near neighbours and with others who have an interest in continuing peace in our region. We have invested $270 billion by way of capacity building and capability building within the Australian Defence Force over this decade, so a significant investment into the equipment that will be deployed by the men and women of the Australian Defence Force in our region. It's incredibly important, because we need to stand up for our sovereignty. We need to make sure that we defend our values. We need to make sure that we don't back away from—</span>

No-one in this parliament, I would hope, has ever been elected, since 1901, who didn't support the men and women of our Australian Defence Force—no-one.

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  I have to say that, with the level of interjections, I didn't hear every word that the minister said, but I was about to intervene on the basis that the question was about the government's policy, and there was no opportunity in that to reflect on the opposition in any way, shape or form. Did the minister make an unparliamentary remark?</span>

                  </a>  No, I did not, but I'm happy to withdraw for the benefit of the House. But it was not unparliamentary. I make that very clear. We stand up for the values of this country and we stand up for the values of the countries in our region. That's the point we're making. And the Australian Defence Force has fought for the values of this country over a long period of time. This side of the House, over many generations, over decades in this country, in contrast to others, have invested into the Defence Force. We have made sure that we have backed our defence forces. That will continue into the future.</span>

As he said, we have an industrial relations framework which reflects what was introduced by the previous government. I make it very clear: our government has zero tolerance for any exploitation of workers and is committed to ensuring that workers have the opportunity to make a positive contribution to the Australian economy without the fear of exploitation. We have the highest minimum wage in the world and we have extensive safety guards in place. Of course, if the member wants to provide further information about the individual circumstances, we will look at it, but we have clear safeguards in place to support people in the workforce.</span>

Clearly, the way that we live and work today is very much dependent on our online connectivity, and that's why this government is investing close to $1.7 billion in the Australian Cyber Security Strategy 2020. To put it in quite simple terms, the strategy is all about ensuring that government, businesses and individuals are aware and are engaged in protecting themselves from the threat of cybercrime. We've all seen how devastating it can be when a critical system is taken offline. The impact of the pipeline attack in the United States last month was a prime example and a very good example of the impact on businesses and also on individuals. That's why this government is introducing some groundbreaking laws that will greatly strengthen the security and resilience of our nation's critical infrastructure and of our supply chains.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will ensure that the systems that Australians rely on every single day—that includes things like our airports, hospitals, energy grids, water and banking—will have a higher degree of protection and capability to enable them to respond to an attack. These reforms are, in fact, a world first. No other country is doing as much as Australia is to protect its critical assets from attack.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just about protection; we are also proactively going after those criminals who target our criminal systems and our businesses online. In fact, this government has a very strong and a very clear message to any cybercriminals who are out there operating on the dark web or hiding behind web encryption, and that is to consider themselves to be on notice: the full extent of Australia's intelligence and law enforcement capabilities are being aimed directly at them. The Morrison-McCormack government is tackling this in a very strong and very practical way. This involves us combining the forces of our very outstanding agencies, including the Australian Federal Police, ASIO, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission and the Signals Directorate, through the Australian Cyber Security Centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly our businesses have a very important role to play in this. We are very committed to making sure that not only governments but businesses and individuals are proactively taking steps to ensure that they are able to protect themselves online. This is a two-way street, and we call on businesses to play their part, to make sure that they are protecting their online assets as they do their physical assets. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The government's record—and I appreciate that the member didn't mention this in his question—regarding worker exploitation and wage underpayment: we have zero tolerance for any exploitation of workers. That includes the underpayment of wages and entitlements by any employer. We have zero tolerance, and the government has taken unprecedented action to protect vulnerable workers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2016 we have committed more than $160 million in new funding to the Fair Work Ombudsman, have strengthened the Fair Work Ombudsman's investigative powers to compel witnesses to provide evidence and have increased penalties for worker exploitation up to 10-fold. People who work should be paid a fair and decent wage. That is why a decision was made this week to do just that. That is why Australia has the highest minimum wage in the world, and we should be proud of that—and it's gone up. The government has introduced reforms to protect employees' superannuation, to address the black economy, to target legal phoenixing activity. We recognise that many employers—most employers—are doing the right thing by their workers; indeed, they are. However, some businesses are still not paying enough attention or are having difficulty navigating what is sometimes a complex system. But we will not stand for any exploitation of workers—workers who are being used and abused and not being paid the right amount. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr LITTLEPROUD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management and Deputy Leader of the National Party</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:03</span>):  I thank the member for Mallee for her question and her interest in understanding the role innovation and research play in Australian agriculture and in helping it reach its goal of $100 billion by 2030. Proudly, this year Australian agriculture reached $66.3 billion, when we estimated at the start of this financial year that it would get to only $60 billion—in spite of drought, fire, flood and COVID-19. Australian agriculture has been supported by the very best science and technology research that is supporting Australian agricultural jobs—all 334,000 of them. This will continue to grow those jobs—the new jobs within agriculture, the ones in research, science and technology that will bring the next generation to and keep them in regional and rural Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why one of the key pillars of our Ag2030 plan is around investment in our innovation systems. We're doing that through cold, hard cash and making sure we're complementing the more than $1.1 billion that goes every year from the levy payer and the Australian taxpayer into research and development, to agricultural research and science. This is giving us cutting-edge tools to face up to the challenges that we here in Australia have had to endure over the last 12 months. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, we've done that with a new digital platform now bringing together all the research that is being done across 15 commodity RDCs, making sure that there is a lens from one commodity to another about what they are doing and how they are doing it so that they can collaborate, instead of working in silos, so there is not duplication of research. We have a world-first digital platform for understanding what the best and brightest researchers in the world are doing here in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're complementing that now with physical platforms right across the country—a $66 million investment, partnering with industry in $114 million, to create eight innovation drought hubs not just for drought research but for agricultural innovation research. That's partnering with those research development corporations, getting better bang for our buck. But, more importantly, it's putting these hubs out in the regions. These hubs are out in front of regional Australia, out in front of farmers, so that the adoption of that research and development will be taken up by farmers, because the research that we do is only worthwhile if our farmers take it up. These hubs already have nodes, and there are jobs that are being created in the hubs and the nodes. In particular, if you go to Victoria, from Dookie college there are nodes where we are putting men and women on the ground to extend that research and technology out to kitchen tables right across regional Victoria to ensure that our farmers know what's there and are given the opportunity to adopt it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the type of environment that we're putting in place to make sure that the best and brightest are working in agriculture—the jobs in agriculture that bring our young people home not just into the traditional jobs but into the new jobs that will drive young Australians to live in regional Australia and work in agriculture.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Indigenous Australians</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:07</span>):  I thank the member for Curtin for your ongoing interest in the work that I'm doing. The Morrison-McCormack government is committed to securing the economic future of Indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory. On the weekend, the Acting Prime Minister and I were at Barunga—the member for Lingiari was there as well—and we had the opportunity of announcing an initiative that will establish an independent body that will have an endowment of $500 million to enable Indigenous Australians within the Northern Territory to plan their own economic future. Currently, under the ABA arrangements, the ABA make decisions in regard to the grants and then the minister either approves them or disapproves them. This way, they will determine the opportunities for economic development for their grandchildren and for the future generations that come afterwards. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this process, we co-designed with the land councils what the independent body would look like, what the membership would be and what the initiatives would be that would allow it to make decisions to contribute to the development of opportunities but, equally, to contribute within the Northern Territory economy. When we made that announcement, it was well received because, as they said, 'For the first time, we're going to be making decisions about the money from the royalties that come into the ABA.' This creates an opportunity to invest in aquaculture, agriculture and, certainly, tourism and other commercial ventures which will provide job opportunities that will be far-reaching into the future. They're even talking about equity investment in some of the mining ventures that may happen within the Territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This gives all people in the Territory the opportunity to contribute to their economic development. The new body will be required to consult with Indigenous people within the Territory. At the end of the planning process, the minister will table in parliament the economic strategy, which will be a three-year strategy to realise the utilisation of funding, which has been used fundamentally on a project basis, to also look at economic opportunities. Instead of ordering 15 tractors separately, they will look at economies of scale. It will give our people in the Territory the opportunity to become their own managers of the funds that are set aside for them. It will also enable them, through a $60 million injection into that endowment fund, to provide for homeland movements, housing and other significant infrastructure opportunities that will make an incredible difference. The Gunner government have welcomed the reform and the changes.</span>

Thank you, Tony. We say simply this: thank you so much for all that you have done, and we wish you every bit of good health and happiness in the future.</span>

It is quite remarkable that, when Tony retires next month, it will be after 50 years of service. I can confirm that he is the longest-serving driver in Comcar history. He started a long time ago. They've got here the age at which you started, Tony. I won't give it, but you've been driving for 50 years. You began driving a Ford Galaxy. I do note that you started as a permanent and finished as a casual. Comcar drivers are famously among the most discreet people on earth, and all of us rely upon that. The member for Fenner, your local member, asked you a question about your experience, and you responded with just this statement: 'We had some fun with Hawke.' I bet you did, Tony! I hope you had fun and a great experience with so many more of us. We are indebted to you and we thank you. You symbolise the great work that all Comcar drivers do for all of us.</span>

That search indicated that I had made 11 speeches using the word 'arts' and the minister himself had only made six. So I'll be glad to send my speeches to the minister after question time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  On Tuesday, the member for Hughes raised, as a matter of privilege, whether the removal by YouTube from its platform, on 7 June, of a video containing a speech made in the House by the member, represents the censoring of parliamentary debate and an improper interference with his duties as a member, such as to amount to a contempt of the House.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Hughes presented two emails sent to him by YouTube as supporting information.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While acts which attempt to interfere with the free performance by a member of his or her duties as a member can be regarded as a contempt, such acts must amount to, or be intended or likely to amount to improper interference in the free performance of the member's duties as a member.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the emails presented to the House by the member, YouTube has stated that it removed the member's video because it violated the platform's medical misinformation policy. No evidence has been provided that indicates the action by YouTube was directed at the member in his capacity as a member.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">YouTube is not the official provider of the parliamentary broadcast; the official webcast of proceedings is available on the parliament's website. I acknowledge that the member for Hughes considers that YouTube's action has impacted his ability to perform aspects of his role. I do not accept the member's assertion that the removal of his speech from this platform constitutes the censoring of parliamentary proceedings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Hughes also refers to a 'threat' by YouTube to restrict his channel if any further violations of the medical misinformation policy occur. On the information provided, this appears simply to be a standard warning about complying with the platform's policies, and again not directed at the member in his capacity as a member.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For these reasons, and given the consistently held view that the House's privileges and contempt powers should be exercised sparingly, I do not find that a prima facie case has been established such as would cause me to give precedence to a motion to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  If you listen to this government's rhetoric that Australian families have never been better off, it is far from the truth of the lived experiences of families right around this country. Australian families are groaning under the burden of the cost of child care. The Morrison government's spin cannot deny the cold, hard facts. We know that long day care fees went up by 2.4 per cent in 2020. Those on the other side might say this is a real coup, but, of course, that included four months of free child care. That has put a huge burden on Australian families. The fees have been hiked up by 9.3 per cent under Scott Morrison's new childcare subsidy. Under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, fees are now up by 37.2 per cent since their election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government doesn't like to talk about the fee increase data. It likes to refer to the ABS index of out-of-pockets costs. The government has regularly used this in this chamber as bragging rights for how good their new system is. Of course, if we use that figure, the ABS has now released and shown that the index is even higher under the new system. Out-of-pocket costs in this country, on average, have never been as high as they are under this government. Costs soared by 2.2 per cent in the March quarter of 2021, which is three times the rate of inflation. This shows that childcare costs are eating a bigger and bigger hole in household budgets and putting more financial stress and strain on Australian families. The cost of child care is having real impacts in other ways. Research released today by the Front Project, based on a survey of 1,700 families, found that 73 per cent of families say the cost of child care is a barrier to them having more children. Families are deciding not to have more children because of the cost of child care. Fifty-two per cent agreed that, once the cost is factored in, it's hardly worth working. This is the lived experience of Australian families. No matter how many times the coalition wants to tell them that the cost isn't that high, they're only paying such and such per hour and they've never been better off, that is not the lived experience of Australian families, and the government should not insult their intelligence by trying to say otherwise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor knows the government's system is busted. That is why we have announced an ambitious plan to make child care cheaper for one million Australian families. Despite the government bragging over the last number of years that families have never been better off, their system is great and there were no eroding out-of-pocket costs, they have suddenly, in this budget, been dragged kicking and screaming into an admission that their system—Scott Morrison's system—has indeed failed. But like everything with this government, when they were putting together their response in the budget after mounting pressure from economists, families, business—from everyone, really—they focused on the announcement and not on getting the policy right. In fact, they didn't listen to any of the groups calling for long-term change. What they did was cook up something that no-one had suggested. No-one had suggested this policy. They even made a childcare centre open on Sunday—childcare centres are not open on Sundays, Minister—and made some families come in on the weekend so they could get the cameras and the TV crews in just to spruik their system. There is not enough time on the policy, too much time on the announcement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem with the government's announcement—one of the many problems with the government's announcement—is that it will not see an extra cent of support in the subsidy increases for three-quarters of the families using the system. Families paying out-of-school or after-school-hours or vacation care costs don't get extra help from this government. The government has picked and chosen which families deserve support and which don't. We hear time and time again from families that this just isn't fair. The government is once again ignoring the lived experience. The government has announced a complex and restrictive policy that only benefits families who have in care at least two children below school age. We are still not sure. I asked the minister yesterday in consideration in detail whether, if a 4½ year old was in after-school-hours care, they would attract an extra subsidy. He hasn't been able to answer that on television, and he wasn't able to answer it yesterday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An analysis comparing Labor and Liberal childcare policies shows unequivocally that Labor's policy provides more support for more families for longer. Indeed, 86 per cent of all families with children under the age of six in the system would be better off under Labor's policy. The families of children in after-school-hours care or in vacation care would get more support under Labor. Every single family with one child aged five or under in care—that's 727,000 families—with a combined family income less than $530,000 will receive no extra support in their childcare subsidy under this Liberal government but they would under Labor. The vast majority of families with a combined family income between $69,000 and $174,000 with two children in child care would be better off under Labor. So people should not fall for the rhetoric of this government. The government will come up and say, 'Ours is more targeted. We want to help families in a targeted way.' That means if you've got one child in care or you're a low- or middle-income earner with two children in care the government won't support you as much as Labor will. That's the truth of it. Don't be mistaken by this government's spin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, extra support that the Liberals do provide to families with two or more children is only temporary. With their complex system this extra support is ripped away as soon as the child goes to school, somehow suggesting that families don't need the extra support in after-school-hours care or vacation care and, indeed, that having one child in child care is actually quite a significant cost. In contrast, Labor's boost in support will be provided to every child for the entire time they are in care. We will move towards a universal 90 per cent childcare system. We will also get the ACCC to design a price regulation mechanism that will shed a light on costs and fees and drive them down for good.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no wonder that the Prime Minister was too embarrassed to turn up at the announcement of the government's new childcare policy, because it was he himself who designed the failed current system. He handballed that to the Treasurer, and the Treasurer hasn't spoken about it since. I'm so pleased that the Minister for Education and Youth is going to do the MPI today, because, since the announcement, we haven't seen him get out and proudly talk about the childcare announcement. We haven't seen a question in question time for some time. Even when the Minister for Women is asked about economic security the government won't talk about their childcare policy. That's because they've realised it's a dud. Families around the country have realised it's a dud. This was about papering over a failed system, trying to paper over the criticism that has come from all quarters and make this issue go away. Of course, the government didn't take it that seriously. Guess when their policy starts. You'd think maybe on 1 July coming they'd like to give families some relief, that, if they've acknowledged it's a problem, they would give families relief on 1 July this year. But this policy doesn't start until 1 July 2022. That is actually after an election. It's actually the same date that we propose to start our policy, if we're elected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, this government is all crocodile tears when it comes to the cost of child care. In one breath they say, 'Families have never been better off,' and in the next breath they say, 'We'll tinker around with the system, because we're under increasing pressure.' This is really about fixing mistakes. It is really about trying to paper over a failed childcare system, and it will not lead to proper long-term change. It won't lead to long-term relief for families. It won't even lead to workforce productivity. In fact, the budget papers show that workforce participation is actually going to go down. This government has designed a childcare policy that reduces workforce participation not boost it. This government could not design a childcare policy if their life depended on it. We need a Labor government to introduce cheaper child care. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M2Y" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TUDGE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Education and Youth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:28</span>):  The first thing I'd say is that I'm not going to be lectured to by the opposition in relation to childcare fees. When they were in government, childcare fees went up 53 per cent, and in one year alone they went up by 14.5 per cent, so we're not going to be taking lectures in relation to childcare fees from those opposite. The greatest support their current policy will provide is literally to those people who are earning $360,000 or more. It really says something about the modern-day Labor Party when that is their target.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our policy completely reformed the childcare system three years ago and put in place a system which is based on those who have the most means getting the least amount of assistance and those who have the least means getting the most amount of assistance all the way up to 85 per cent of fees. In some cases, the full fees can be taken care of by the government. What we've done, as part of this package, is put in place an activity test. That was in recognition of the fact that the childcare system, by and large, is there to support parents, particularly women, who want to go back to the workforce, are volunteering their efforts or are seeking a job. If they're doing any one of those activities, they can get support through our childcare system. Furthermore, we introduced a fee cap, which puts downward pressure on those fees. I point out that 87 per cent of childcare fees are still below that fee cap. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Has this worked? Has our record extra funding into child care worked? Absolutely. I'll point out some of the data. We've increased funding by 77 per cent since coming to office. Firstly, 280,000 more families have children in child care than when we came to office. Secondly, we have record workforce participation rates amongst women. Today the figures came out. The female participation rate is 61.7 per cent. That's at record levels, even higher than before the pandemic began. Something is working in terms of our childcare policy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I point out that the out-of-pocket expenses for our childcare system are still on average a dollar down per hour than what they were only a few years ago, before we introduced our policy. At the end of the day, that's what matters. It's not the fees overall that matter. It is the out-of-pocket expenses which matter—the fees charged by the childcare centre minus the subsidy which the government provides. The out-of-pocket expenses are still down $1, on average, compared to what they were before we introduced our massive reform back in 2018, which completely transformed the childcare system. What does this mean now in terms of what everyday families are paying for child care? I can tell you that the average out-of-pocket expense that parents pay today is $3.93 per hour. I can also inform the House that a quarter of all families are paying less than $2 per hour for their child care. The taxpayer makes up, on average, the other $8 per hour. This makes it affordable for a great many families to participate in child care, should they choose to do so. As I've pointed out, there are actually now 280,000 more families who are taking advantage of this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have acknowledged—and we acknowledged this in the budget this year—is that, even if the fees are relatively low on a per-hour basis, if you have more than one child in child care, those fees can still add up. Consequently, we introduced quite a targeted new measure in this year's budget. That measure was to provide an additional subsidy for families who have a second and third child in the childcare system. It applies to all children who are five years and under, to answer the member for Kingston's previous question. What does this mean for the average family? For families with an income of $110,000, which is the median income for families in the childcare system, they'll be about $120 per week—almost $6,000 per year—better off under our scheme if they have two children in full-time child care. It makes a real difference to those families who have two or more children in child care. That's when the costs add up, when you've got multiple children in the childcare system, even if you are paying just $2 per hour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to draw a contrast here between what our policy is and what Labor's policy is. Our policy has been deliberately designed, in its overall structure, to be targeted at those who need it most. For those who are of very significant means, earning $360,000 or more per year, they don't get a cent of childcare subsidies, because we believe that a family earning $360,000 or more should be able to pay for their own child care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the contrast is stark here because the Labor Party policy, incredibly, is to provide childcare subsidies of 90 per cent to every single family across Australia. This means that the greatest beneficiaries of their childcare policy are those families earning $360,000 or more. What does this mean? A family could be on $500,000 a year and, if they have two children in child care, under our policy they don't get a cent of subsidy. Under the Labor Party policy they will be getting $50,000 worth of taxpayer funded child care if they have two children in full-time care. This is the modern Labor Party, where the greatest beneficiaries of their childcare policy are those people earning $500,000, $1 million or more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's more, that family earning $500,000 who's got a couple of kids in full-time care and is now getting $50,000 in free child care under the Labor Party won't even have an activity test. They don't even have to be working. They could be doing whatever they like during the day but just decide they want to have their children in child care during the week, and it is no problem. Under the Labor Party, the taxpayer will subsidise them for that. We find that astounding, but it actually goes to the very heart of why the Labor Party is in such disarray at the moment—</span>

They drive the policy of the greatest beneficiaries of their childcare policy being those who are earning a million dollars or more.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our childcare policy has been working. We acknowledge that for many families there's still an impost—that they have to dig in and they have to be able to find those additional means to pay for the child care which they in many cases desperately need in order to go to work to support their families. But we believe very firmly that the additional measures we're putting into the budget will make a real impact for 250,000 families. We believe that overall our childcare system, which is geared towards those who need it most and tapers off down to zero for those in very wealthy families, is a fair system and is not only fair to the people in the childcare system but fair to the 54 per cent of families who don't use the childcare system and who are still paying taxes.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:38</span>):  I'm happy to make a contribution to the member for Kingston's MPI. I sat with the member for Kingston when we were looking at the budget in detail up in the Federation Chamber. I heard some great questions from the member for Kingston but not a single answer from the minister opposite. So it's great to have a 10-minute discussion about child care here today, because he somehow managed to avoid answering the member for Kingston's questions up in the Federation Chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's get some facts out there because there was quite a lot of hot air and bluster flowing around for the last 10 minutes. No. 1: Australians pay more for child care than basically any other country in the world. That's a fact. So we know more needs to be done. Fact No. 2: the coalition's childcare policy was designed by then Treasurer Morrison, now Prime Minister Morrison. It has his fingerprints all over it. The system, designed by the Prime Minister, is his baby, so to speak, when it comes to child care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The facts are that childcare costs are out of control, as touched on by the member for Kingston. They have basically increased by three times CPI: over the past 12 months childcare costs soared by 3.7 per cent, compared to a CPI increase of 1.1 per cent. We know—the economists tell us; not the so-called inner-city people that the minister was talking about but the Business Council, economists—and every sensible person knows, we need to get more people into the workforce. What's holding them back? Childcare costs. So the business groups, the economists and the other experts are all calling for an urgent reform of the childcare system that the Prime Minister gave birth to—and I do apologise for that metaphor. KPMG has estimated childcare reform could generate between 160,000 and 210,000 additional working days a week. That's 30,000 to 40,000 full-time jobs. We know that there are considerable pressures on the economy. We know, as The Front Project report says, there are fewer people having babies. It's a barrier to having babies. According to the 1,700 families surveyed, 73 per cent of them say that childcare costs will result in lower birth rates. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What are we doing about these issues? We've got the borders closed. We've also got no international students flying in, which used to be a pathway for educated, trained-up people to join our workforce. We'd harvest other countries' brightest people. We'd bring them in, put them through our universities and get the benefits of them in the economy, especially for tourism and all sorts of things, in the workplace, like picking fruit on their holidays. Those people aren't coming. The international students aren't coming in, because the government has completely stuffed up the quarantine program. We've got the borders closed, so we can't harvest the intelligent people from around the world. We know that the Canadians, the United States and the British are taking our international students, what used to be our third biggest export. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what do the economists say? We need to get more people into the workforce. That's where the productivity game will come. We're not going to have a population increase. Remember the last few budgets? There has been a baby boom predicted in every single budget under those opposite, and we've got the actual birth rates going down under the coalition, under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:43</span>):  As the father of a three-year-old, I know how important child care is to young families in my electorate. Child care provides quality early childhood education for children, and, most importantly, it leads to increased workforce participation, allowing parents to support their families. There was much that the member for Moreton said that I disagreed with, but what he did say that was right was that we need to increase workforce participation. I think we are doing that handsomely under the Morrison government. The wonderful unemployment rate that came down today had figures as low as 5.1 per cent. As the Treasurer said in question time, the economy is roaring back. People are coming back to work in the economy. Our childcare system is playing a part in ensuring that women in particular are able to rejoin the workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to be part of a government that has seen women's workforce participation increase. When Labor left office, it was at 58.7 per cent, and today's ABS data indicates that this has increased now to 61.7 per cent, despite the fact that we have had the great economic shock of the COVID-19 recession. Labor likes to lecture us on childcare fees and costs, but it's also to be remembered that childcare fees under Labor went up 53 per cent. By contrast, since we came to office, we've been spending much more on child care than the Labor Party, 77 per cent more—indeed, a record $10.3 billion this year, including $9 billion to subsidise the fees set by childcare services. There are an extraordinary number of children in child care now—over 280,000 more children in child care today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I talk to young families in my electorate, people are very pleased at the announcement we've made in the budget to provide $1.7 billion to Australian families to help them with child care. These are families that send their children to some of the many childcare centres in my electorate, whether it's Galston Early Learning, Greenwood Early Education, Kindilan, Kids in the Sky or Goodstart Early Learning. They are just a few of the many childcare centres that operate in my electorate. This particular measure will really be important because it will help families with their out-of-pocket costs, and that's the big issue in child care for families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By increasing the subsidy for families with a second or third child under five years of age, a quarter of a million families will be better off. On average, families will be better off by $2,260 per year, and this will make a real difference. For example, a family typically in my electorate earning $180,000 a year with two children in four days a week child care will be $125 better off. In particular, the measure to remove the cap of $10,560 on the childcare subsidy is a big deal for families in my electorate and has been warmly welcomed. The measures in the government's childcare package will benefit 1,160 families across the Berowra electorate, and this is really important for those families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This particular package has been welcomed by a whole range of stakeholders that perhaps don't always cheer on the government. Let me remind the House of what some of the different agencies and people that have engaged in childcare policy have said. UNICEF said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The injection of $1.7b additional funds into the 2021-22 Budget is a welcome and important step in improving the affordability of early childhood education and care for Australian families. The Government has targeted these measures carefully to help increase access to early childhood education and care services for children in low and lower middle-income families. We are encouraged by this focus …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They're right. The Early Learning and Care Council of Australia said the budget:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… delivers for children, families and Australia’s early learning and care sector, increasing investment to support young children’s learning and women’s workforce participation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Workforce participation is key to the Business Council of Australia. Jennifer Westacott, their CEO, said, 'This is good for mums and dads, good for business and good for the economy.' Early Childhood Australia boss, Sam Page, said, 'It's good for children, good for families and good for the economy.' Goodstart Early Learning CEO, Julia Davison, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The removal of the annual cap will also reduce stress of many families who run out of subsidy towards the end of the financial year and then need to scramble to make ends meet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's true of so many of the families in my electorate who depend on quality child care not just for the education of their children but also to allow both mum and dad to go to work to support their families and to provide for their families in the manner in which they would like, to deal with the costs of living that they face. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the federal government's childcare policy package. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:48</span>):  I'm pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance today because I can say wholeheartedly that people are really struggling in my electorate. With everything people have gone through—drought, bushfires, flood after flood and, of course, the pandemic—people have had enough. Parents, children, workers, small-business owners—it's taking its toll on everyone. But there is a glowing light amongst all of this, and that is the recognition that above everything else our family, friends and community are vital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm immensely proud of my community—the toughest of times and people pull together. It's like a giant washing machine. Throw in drought, bushfires, floods, pandemic, all mixed together, and see what it turns out like. We've seen businesses close, workers lose their jobs and the most extraordinary conditions. We've seen a boom in construction as people rebuild after the bushfires. We've also seen people flock to our country coastal area, keen to find that clean country coastal air for both tourism and to live, which is great for our local shops and spending but there's an unintended lurgy. When you open that washing machine lid or door you're left with spiralling house prices, the lowest rental availability in New South Wales—and, suddenly, more and more people struggle to have somewhere to live. And the bizarre consequence is that workers are harder to find. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For families and businesses in my electorate it's at crisis point. Many want to work or work more days and hours but without the basics of affordable child care it simply isn't an option. The truth is that childcare costs are eating a bigger and bigger hole in household budgets and putting more financial strain on families. When times are tough the choice between putting food on the table or accessing child care for your child or children is horrible to even contemplate. But it shouldn't be that way. Every child deserves access to early education. We know that's one of the best things to help in preparation for school and future life. Every parent should be able to work. They need a childcare system that supports them and, in turn, supports our local businesses and communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Childcare fees are up 37 per cent under the Liberals and went up 2.4 per cent last year. The cost of child care is now higher than it was under the previous childcare system and it's the highest it's ever been. Recently I visited a new early learning centre in Milton in my electorate, Milton Early Learning and Care, a fantastic centre with big fat smiles. What struck me about this centre was the devotion of early-learning educators and the integration of families. I wasn't surprised to learn that the centre was already very close to full—such is the demand for the area. I want to send a big shout-out to all the early-learning educators on the New South Wales South Coast. They do the most amazing and important work: educating our young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the government must do more. The coalition's childcare system is broken. That is why Labor has a plan to bring down the cost of child care for families and keep it down. An Albanese Labor government will introduce cheaper child care for working families which will scrap the $10,560 childcare subsidy cap—which often sees women losing money from an extra day's work—lift the maximum childcare subsidy rate to 90 per cent, increase childcare subsidy rates and taper them for every family earning less than $530,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the ACCC will design a price regulation mechanism to shed light on costs and fees and drive them down for good. The Productivity Commission will also conduct a comprehensive review of the sector, with the aim of implementing a universal 90 per cent subsidy for all families. Labor's plan for cheaper child care will reward working families and allow more second-income earners, usually women, to work more and contribute to our economic recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Families deserve better. Children deserve better. Businesses and my community deserve better. More women and parents should be able to work. They should be able to earn more of an income. Businesses should be able to find more workers. It starts with affordable child care. Only Labor has a plan to fix the coalition's broken childcare system.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282986" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALLEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:53</span>):  As the Treasurer said, we want more Australians in jobs. In jobs there is dignity, there is a meaning and there is purpose. That should be open to men and women equally. One of the ways we are doing this is by protecting and improving child care. By lifting barriers we help reduce the disincentives for men and women with young families and help them to participate in the workforce to the full extent that they can.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I had my children, 25 years ago, there were not these opportunities for people to have that support. That's why I welcome the fact that our coalition government has delivered for the people of Australia, for the families of Australia. When a family welcomes a baby it's an incredibly exciting and sometimes turbulent time, but to have the freedom of choice on how they care for their new family empowers parents—freedom to balance their new responsibilities without sacrificing their career or their precious time with their children. Perhaps a parent would like to undertake study or further training while caring for their children. Perhaps they would like to go back to work for a day or two a week as their children grow. This is an incredibly important transition time for young families, particularly as they develop and balance their career with their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud of the commitment this government has made to preserving family choice. Our government has announced, starting on 1 July 2022, an increase in childcare subsidies available to families with more than one child aged five or under in child care. This will benefit about 850 families in my electorate of Higgins alone, and almost 61,000 families in Victoria. For those with more than one child in child care, the level of subsidy received will increase by 30 per cent to a maximum subsidy of 95 per cent of fees paid for the second and subsequent children. This is akin to saying, 'You can have the family size that you want.' This is fantastic news. These changes will ensure half of Australian families receive a 95 per cent subsidy for the second child and subsequent children. Secondly, the annual cap of $10,560 for families earning over $189,000 will be removed for all families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know what matters most to families, and that is their out-of-pocket costs. Our system targets the greatest level of support for families on low and middle incomes. This is so incredibly important. We have kept out-of-pocket costs low. Three years on since the introduction of our reforming childcare package, out-of-pocket costs are still almost $1 an hour cheaper, on average. They are $3.99, down from $4.87 in June 2018. A quarter of all families are paying less than $2 an hour for child care. Around 90 per cent of families are entitled to a childcare subsidy of between 50 and 85 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This investment builds on the $10.3 billion that the government is already investing in child care this year. Increasing the childcare subsidy for families with two or more children will help support the choices of working Australian families. This is a targeted investment to help make child care more affordable. It's vital for our economy and it's vital for families. But don't just believe me when I talk about this; let's look to the experts in the sector who have reviewed our recommendations, policies and subsidies. Let's look to KPMG and Alison Kitchen. She says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are very clear that this additional childcare support will significantly increase women's participation in the workforce, which our modelling has shown will be a major long-term boost to the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very delighted to say we're seeing the highest rate of women's workforce participation. We know our policies are working. I'm very proud to say that we can report today 61.7 per cent female workforce participation. That is the highest on record. This is in contrast to 58.7 per cent when Labor left office. Today, unemployment is down to 5.1 per cent and 987,000 jobs have been added in the last 12 months, 574,000 of them were for women. We know our policies are there and are supporting women. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the Australian Childcare Alliance. They welcome the reforms to the childcare subsidy improving affordability for many families. Let's look to the Grattan Institute. They say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Overall, the Coalition's policy is a helpful and well-targeted package that tackles some of the worst out-of-pocket costs and workforce disincentives. It will mean a real improvement for up to 270,000 families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look to Chief Executive Women. They said that they:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… welcomed the Federal Treasurer's funding announcement to increase access to childcare as an important step towards helping more women participate in the workforce.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:58</span>):  There are times in this chamber when it almost feels like being Alice in Wonderland. It's like you live in an alternate universe to the people on that side of the chamber. The things that the members on the other side of the chamber say are so fundamentally disconnected from the actual lived experiences of people like the people in my community, we must almost be living in different countries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have all of these members of the government—from the minister, who's turned his back on me, down—and none of them so far have addressed the research released today by the Front Project. So far, none of them have addressed a survey of 1,700 families showing that 73 per cent of families say the cost of child care is a barrier to having more children. We have the member for Higgins saying: 'Oh, isn't it wonderful! Families can have as many children as they want.' That is, as long as they're all under five—she forgot that part of the impact of the government's policy. And there was no reference, none whatsoever, to the cost of child care being a barrier to having more children for 73 per cent of families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're pretending this is a debate in this chamber—for once, because they're not gagging us during the MPI, like all the other times—let's also talk about some of the other ridiculous things that were said on the other side of the chamber: 'Oh, great! We announced a policy.' Well, good, you did, after a long time suggesting that Labor was lying and making up stories about why the childcare system was broken and needed to be fixed. It would seem to me that the fundamental basis of introducing reforms is to accept that the system isn't working, because what else were you doing when you were apparently reforming it?</span>

They will be better off in 12 months because there will be a federal Labor government with a childcare policy so much better than yours that it will put yours in the shade.</span>

So next time you are talking about your policies, maybe talk about the actual details so people know that they will not be better off tomorrow or next week or next month; they will be better off possibly in 12 months, if you are re-elected. Some 750,000 people are left out. The way that people will be better off under a reformed childcare system is if they vote for a Labor government.

                  </a>  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. On 2 February this year, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span> reported, with the headline 'High childcare costs push 90,000 parents out of the workforce', the story of my constituent, Emily Hovette, who is 33 years old, who works full-time and her two-year-old daughter, Margot, is in child care five days a week and her out-of-pocket expenses are $350. She and her husband, who also works full-time, plan to have a second child. How are they going to pay for it is what Emily asks. How are they going to pay $700 a week? She said it's 'a hell of a lot of money and it's going to be really tough, but we are prepared to do it because there are no other options'.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWS" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  On one hand I am surprised at this MPI motion today but on the other hand I am not. I've been here a while and I remember what it's like in opposition and how hard it is to score a point when things are going well for the government. That was the case for my side of politics in 2008, when the Rudd government was first elected. They had a surplus budget they had inherited, they had $80 billion in the bank and they had an unemployment rate of less than five per cent. But, of course, history shows it wasn't long before we had something to complain about, because it all went pear shaped under that regime. Then, as an opposition, we had plenty of points to pick up. You can see how difficult it is for the opposition to have a go at the government. Today when we heard the unemployment figures had fallen to 5.1 per cent, you would have thought that somebody had stolen their lunch. Over there, they were like a mob of year 4s and someone had nicked their lunch; they were so bloody miserable. For goodness sake, if you're here for the good of Australia, you should be absolutely rejoicing in the 5.1 per cent unemployment rate after the worst economic shock in a hundred years. They should have been overjoyed. But they looked like they'd lost their lunch. It was a really tough day for them! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So here we are talking about child care. I've heard four speakers—in fact, I heard you twice, Member for Kingston, because you spoke for 10 minutes yourself and you spoke for 10 minutes while the minister answered. So you've had 20 minutes on this program. There have been four speakers on this MPI from that side. That is more than double the complaints about child care that I've had come into my office in the last 12 months. I kid you not. Talk about trying to make an issue out of nothing. How weak is this opposition? For goodness sake, celebrate the good things we're doing in child care. We are doing good things. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard the member for Gilmore say that the cost of child care had risen by 37 per cent under this government. I don't actually know if that figure's right, but I'll take it at face value—37 per cent. We've been in government for eight years. In fact, it rose by 53 per cent in the six years that the Labor Party were in government. This is the trouble when you start speaking in front of people who have got a bit of a history in this place; we've also got a bit of a memory. So how on earth can you be complaining about that outcome? The rates for child care on an hourly basis have fallen by close to a dollar over the last three years. That is a fantastic outcome. As for expenditure on child care, when Labor were last in power, it was $5.8 billion per annum. This year it's $10.3 billion per annum, a 77 per cent increase. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I am surprised that the member for Kingston brought this motion forward, but they are quite desperate in opposition. It's worth noting, too, that, in that time, the award for those educators working in the childcare system has risen by 36 per cent. Their wages have risen by 36 per cent. That's a pretty good outcome. That is a very good outcome. And we need to pay these educators well—these people who care for our children. Perhaps we need to even pay them better. But it's certainly a very good position that we're in, and much, much better than what we inherited.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the budget we just announced that we're going to better target more assistance for those people with more children. If you've got more than one child in day care, we're actually going to reward you at a higher level, up to 95 per cent. That's really a pretty astonishing outcome, isn't it—95 per cent of your childcare costs picked up? We've got to know, when we bring children into the world, that we do have some responsibility for them. I think five per cent's not an unfair ask.</span>

                  </a>  Well, it is only for the second one. And I think that that's what we on this side of the House have got right. We understand that's when the pressure comes on. That's when you need to put your shoulder to the wheel. So I back the current policies. I think we're doing a pretty good job. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  I want to congratulate the member for Kingston on this fine policy that she has developed in consultation with a whole range of stakeholders and a whole range of families from around this nation. It is a superior policy to the one put forward by those opposite. I'm not interested in slinging insults across the chamber. I'll simply say why it is a superior one and should be adopted by those opposite and implemented asap, not in over a year's time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's because when I'm back in my electorate in Darwin and in Palmerston, the capital of the north, talking to people, talking to mums in particular—I was at a childcare centre just last week, meeting with parents, meeting with the childcare educators—the No. 1 concern that young families express almost every time this conversation comes up is unaffordability. Simply, the problem is that working families in my electorate are finding it increasingly difficult to afford child care. They're paying more than ever before, and it is no exaggeration to say that the system is completely broken. Even those opposite must acknowledge that to some extent, given their effort at coming up with a new policy. But it's broken. The Prime Minister designed it, calling it a 'once-in-a generation reform'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not as though, for the seven years they've been in government, families haven't been struggling with child care. But, under this government, childcare fees have gone up by 37 per cent over that period. Just last year, a difficult year, the fee increase in the NT was 3.2 per cent. You mightn't think that sounds like much, but it is when it keeps going up and up and up. Working families in Darwin and Palmerston can't afford these fee increases, and that is a message I'm sending to those opposite right now. The three per cent or so in the last year is on top of all the other increases in the cost of living. What we're doing, through the policy proposed by the member for Kingston, is committing to helping families, because their wages aren't going up, particularly those on low incomes. And let's face it, those on low incomes are rarely in the thoughts and prayers of those opposite—certainly not in their policy prescriptions. Those on low incomes need this support. They are committing to bringing up young Australian families and they need support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to productivity, if we want to get more people into work, particularly women, we need to get the settings right, and that's what our policy does. The situation we find ourselves in now, as the member for Kingston said, is that 73 per cent of Australian women say that childcare costs are stopping Australian families from growing. I think that's a massive problem. We want parents to be able to afford to grow their families. It's the role of those opposite, the role of whoever's in government at the time—hopefully us, after the next federal election—to do a number of things to get our country back on track, and this is a big one in terms of productivity and in terms of supporting Australian working families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Independent analysis says that our early childhood education policy means that there'll be more support for more families for longer. That's a good thing. Early childhood educators love their jobs, but they're finding it increasingly difficult to stay in them. As I said, I visited Goodstart Early Learning in Bakewell, Palmerston last week, and I want to thank the director, Junell Moore, and Bella. I've got the highest respect for the job they do, but it is a reality that they're finding it difficult. Our policy will help families. It will help across the board, particularly at a time when people in my electorate are struggling, with rents going through the roof. Federal Labor's policy, which we will enact after the next election, will help working families.</span>

On behalf of coalition members and the government, I'd like to start by congratulating and thanking childcare workers and early education workers, who are doing such a great job right across Australia. They certainly are doing so in my electorate of Ryan. Those workers have absolutely worked their guts out, particularly through the COVID-19 pandemic. They do a marvellous job in supporting the early education of our kids, as well as supporting mums and dads—families right around Australia—to make the best choices for their family.</span>

The member for Kingston unfortunately has a bit of a track record in this place when it comes to her policy prescriptions. They're a bit brash. They don't always come to fruition. You can see that because she was one of the many members on the other side of the chamber who said that when JobKeeper ended the sky was going to fall in, unemployment would go through the roof and there would be mass casualties all over the place. It didn't happen. In fact, we have seen unemployment drop again this month—consecutively, month on month on month, because of this government's policy prescriptions. It's dropped now to 5.1 per cent, a result that those on the other side, you'd think, along with all members of this place, would be trumpeting, but of course for Labor it's not actually about how many people are in jobs; it's about how many people have signed up with their union mates. When it comes to creating jobs, it's this side that bears the responsibility for that, because we on this side of the House want to make sure that Australians find work and find that opportunity for their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Kingston, just as she was wrong in her policy prescriptions when it came to JobKeeper, unemployment and getting people into jobs, is wrong with her policy prescriptions when it comes to child care. What is her fix for child care? What is Labor and the member for Kingston's proposed fix for child care? It is what Labor always do, which is throwing more money at it—more of your money, more of your taxes, more money out of your pocket because they think they can spend to fix anything. Labor's policy will see the wealthiest of families in this country benefit, at a cost of $20.3 billion over the forward estimates. They have never seen an issue they didn't think they could spend their way out of, and it's not their money at the end of the day. It's your money. It's coming out of your pocket. They will go to yet another election with very expensive policies because for them it's not about thinking through the complexities of issues and trying to find the best policy prescriptions; it's simply about how much of your money they can throw at it. They will go to an election again and ask to reach into your pockets even deeper so that they can provide another $20 billion over the forward estimates—not so that people who need support to get their kids into child care will get it but so that the wealthiest of Australian families will get the support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No wonder they are sensitive on this issue—so sensitive that they need to run another MPI on it. Labor do not have a good story to tell when it comes to child care. Fifty-three per cent—under Labor, that's how much childcare fees increased over just six years. That is a rate of almost 10 per cent a year. What an appalling track record. The hypocrisy they must have to swallow to come into this place and talk about childcare fees when they presided over that kind of record—it takes some doing. Even I am impressed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this government we have put in place a targeted system that gives the greatest level of support to those who need it most, and that's an important distinction. We have kept out-of-pocket costs low to support families on low and middle incomes in particular. Families are paying less for child care under our childcare package, and around 90 per cent of families are entitled to a childcare subsidy. We are spending, in fact, 77 per cent more than Labor was when it left government, and over 280,000 more kids are in child care because of the policy settings of this government. That's enabling choices for their families, It's enabling choices for their parents to re-enter the workforce. It's enabling families to do what they know is best for their own kids and their own families. They're being supported and enabled by this government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:25</span>):  I foreshadow to members of the House that Labor will not be supporting this bill. Current arrangements for self-managed superannuation funds limit the number of members to four. I understand it is the government's proposition to extend that to six members on the basis that it would provide more flexibility. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We deliberately did not form a position on this. We had some concerns about this matter, when it was first raised with the opposition, but referred it to a Senate inquiry to flush out the reviews of consumer representatives, self-managed superannuation fund representatives and their advisers. On the basis of the evidence that we saw before that Senate committee, we're particularly mindful of the evidence given by Super Consumers Australia, who pointed out that the extension from four to six opened up a great risk for harm to members of the superannuation fund. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me explain what I mean by that. If you have a number of children within the same self-managed superannuation fund as their elderly parents, members of that fund are going to have very different interests. In fact, it's very difficult to judge the best interests of each and every member of that fund individually. For example, if you have elderly parents whose house or business is contained within the superannuation fund, the interest of young children who are also members of that superannuation fund is in the maintenance of the assets. The interest of the elderly parents is going to be in the liquidation and realisation of those assets. As Super Consumers Australia pointed out, this measure runs the very great risk of leading to consumer harm to some members of those funds.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  For the benefit of the members of the House, we're dealing with three superannuation bills this afternoon. The first one, which we just voted on, was about self-managed superannuation funds. The second bill of three deals with an extraordinary deal that was done between the government and a senator for Queensland, Senator Hanson, sometime yesterday. This deal, in its original form, saw a proposition brought before the Senate that would increase the excess contributions cap from its current level, $27,500, by $5,000 per annum for a very small group of people—people over the age of 67. I'm reliably informed that there are 17 members of the parliament, including Senator Hanson herself, who have turned 67. Members of the House may be interested to know what pecuniary benefit would fall to those within the class of people identified by the proposed amendment. It is somewhere in the vicinity of $5,000 per annum. At the same time as we're cutting all sorts of benefits to ordinary Australians and threatening to cut their super, we're proposing to increase the superannuation benefits of politicians by $5,000 per annum. It did not proceed—and thankfully so. They were shamed out of doing it. They proposed to do it but it did not proceed—and thankfully so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measure before the House, however, proposes to remove the excess contribution charge. Every member of the House would understand how that works, because we receive a bill every year on excess superannuation contributions. This is a provision which benefits a large group of politicians but a very small group of Australians. At a time when we are trying to resolve the complex issues around superannuation, it is extraordinary in the extreme that this is the priority of this government—a measure that benefits a large group of politicians but a very small group of Australians who earn over $275,000 a year. It's not a priority and Labor won't be supporting the measure.</span>

There it is, from this minister. To be fair, there are some on the other side who are honest about what their view of superannuation is. The Liberal Party's Senator Rennick said in the debate about this legislation across on the other side:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">… if we want to be serious about protecting the battlers in this country, it's time to kill superannuation stone, cold dead</span>.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the view of the Liberal and National parties when it comes to workers having decent retirements and having dignity in their later years. They're not content to trash the aged-care system. They want people to also, before they get to aged care, have a pretty bad retirement. They can't stand the idea that anyone other than their mates can own capital. They can't stand the idea that Australia can have, in our economic system as one of our ballasts, $3 trillion in superannuation funds. The fact is that that is in our national interest, and it's also in the interests of working people. That is why we on this side of the House will always defend superannuation, and why those opposite will always take every opportunity to undermine it. Remember the royal commission aimed at industry funds? What did it find? It found that industry funds were the most effective form of superannuation. It found that self-managed funds and the retail funds just don't stack up in terms of returns and in terms of the costs to superannuants.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The flaws in this bill are multiple. One is that it staples members to dud funds. What we can see will happen is that some people will have an advantage—the retailers, the banks and the mates of those opposite selling their products rather than industry super funds. That's really what it's aimed at here. That has real implications, because workers could be stapled to their first fund. Those opposite mightn't have this experience, but certainly I did: the first job that I had was in retail. And many people will do that. I worked at Maccas, I worked at Grace Brothers, I worked at Pancakes On The Rocks and I worked at various other jobs.</span>

You'd have different priorities. You need different insurance in terms of your job. The fact is this will staple people to funds that aren't appropriate for them. It will staple them to underperforming funds for life. It is bad policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />There's no level playing field in terms of performance and monitoring. We agree that all funds should be subject to performance assessments. The government doesn't believe this. They're excluding funds that some three million Australians are members of. They're some of the for-profit funds. They're some of the funds with the highest fees. They're some of the worst performing funds. How surprising! And this is in contrast to the recommendation of the financial services royal commission. It's in direct contravention of it. But they're prepared to stand up for these funds because they don't actually want a level playing field—because, when you look at a level playing field, industry super wins every time as the best performers. This exposes the ideological agenda of this government. They've gone to every election, like in 2013 and 2016, and said they wouldn't interfere with the super guarantee, but then afterwards they did. They wanted to interfere with this one as well. It's only because, like a whole range of other changes, they're just waiting until after the election and you get Liberal and National parties 'unplugged'. The Liberal and National parties unplugged is killing superannuation stone-cold dead. They said it the other night. It's what they believe. It's what they do at every single opportunity that they have to undermine our superannuation system, while Labor— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:52</span>):  I'll keep my comments relatively brief, because I fear the impatience of my colleagues behind me more than anything that those opposite might do. We're being asked today to vote for a bill that's fatally flawed. It's vastly improved compared to the bill that was originally proposed to the government's party room. The bill that went through their cabinet, their Expenditure Review Committee, went through both of their caucuses unchallenged—it's a vast improvement on that. The reason for that is the tireless efforts of Labor members of parliament, crossbench MPs, members on all sides from the industry and, I have to say, a number of members from the coalition's own backbench who at first believed what their minister told them but then saw so much of it was definitely not true.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's get to the nub of the issue. The nub of the issue is the objective of this bill to improve the performance of funds and the return to members. Every single member of this place supports that objective. If only the legislation did what its title suggests it wants to do. We want to do this. Labor wants to support a bill that will do this. The reality is that the government is intent on turning a blind eye to the funds which have the highest fees and the lowest performance. There is no other explanation for the fact that the government has excluded those funds, which cover over three million employees. The Productivity Commission has said that without government action those three million employees will languish in those funds forever, earning subpar returns and getting high fees. The cost over a lifetime is in excess of $240,000 in lost retirement income. We cannot vote for that. We want to vote for a bill which addresses that, and you refuse to agree to our sensible amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second proposition, as put by the Leader of the Opposition, is that this bill staples employees to funds which the government itself has said are so bad that no new employee should be allowed to join them: 'This fund is so bad that no new employee should be allowed to join it, but you're going to be stapled to it and stuck to it for life.' High fees and low performance, but you want to say that's good enough for these employees! We don't. Agree to our sensible amendments and we can get this fixed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Leader of the Opposition has said, they have a proposition which will ensure that workers in high-risk industries will either be without insurance or be paying thousands and thousands of dollars per annum more for the life insurance they currently have through the group insurance in their superannuation policy. Any member of the public and any member of the crossbench listening to my submission today—I see the member for Hughes nodding—will understand that these are commonsense propositions that should enjoy the reasonable support of all members of this House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It beggars belief that the government, instead of picking up amendments that were proffered by the crossbench in this place and in the Senate, has gone and done a grubby deal with Queensland's Senator Hanson. That's not good enough. We want a bill that we can vote for. It's not this bill. I turn to the members of the crossbench who gave impassioned speeches in the House when the bill was last before it. All the issues that you raised in your speeches last time have not yet been addressed. If you still hold those concerns the only hope you have of having them resolved is to tell the government that this bill is not good enough. Vote with Labor and send a message to the government and to the Senate that we want to vote for a bill that says what it's going to do. We want to vote for a bill that says what the label says it's going to do, and this bill does not.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:57</span>):  On the issue of superannuation, I stand closer to the member for Goldstein than to the members on this side of the House. He gave an excellent speech today, which I would commend to everyone, on the importance of housing affordability and the right of young Australians to access their super for housing. However, I cannot support this bill. The issue we have is stapling. We have different requirements in different industries, especially in high-risk industries, for the insurance component of your superannuation. A worker in a high-risk industry, whether it is mining, deep-sea fishing, industry or farming, has a completely different insurance requirement than someone working in a government office job. Unfortunately the stapling provision will staple you to an insurance policy that is not satisfactory and will not adequately cover many high-risk workers. I don't care whether it is just one Australian that this happens to. If this bill is passed, as sure as night follows day, there will be a case of some young worker who was working in an office job, or at Coles or Woolies, who then goes to work in one of those high-risk occupations, be it mining or on a farm, and has an industrial accident in their first week of work. We know that will happen. They will go back to their stapled insurance policy and find that they are inadequately covered. We are not just stapling the investment component; we are also stapling the insurance component. That is not satisfactory, given the difference in risk in occupations in this country. Therefore, I cannot in good conscience support this bill and vote for that risk to happen.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development and Leader of the Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  As part of our plan to secure Australia's world-leading economic recovery, we are investing in major infrastructure projects right across the country. Consider the scale of these investments: $2 billion for construction of east and west sections of the Great Western Highway from Katoomba to Lithgow in New South Wales; $2 billion to deliver a new Melbourne intermodal terminal; $400 million in additional funding for the Bruce Highway in Queensland; $237½ million for the METRONET Hamilton Street and Wharf Street grade separations and elevations of associated stations in Western Australia; $161.6 million for the Truro bypass in South Australia; an additional $150 million for the national network highways in the Northern Territory; $80 million for Bass Highway safety and freight efficiency upgrades in Tasmania; and $26½ million for the duplication of William Hovell Drive in the Australian Capital Territory. They're big figures, but what they are doing is enabling people to get where they need to be sooner and more safely, and they're also saving lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other works are progressing. Generation-defining projects such as the Western Sydney airport will be complete and open in 2026. We're co-investing in the Sydney Metro-Western Sydney airport rail and the much-needed Melbourne Airport rail link. Inland Rail will revolutionise how we move freight across eastern Australia, intersecting with the east-to-west link. A new study shows freight costs will be slashed by up to 44 per cent. With bilateral trade deals now covering more than 70 per cent of our exports, and with more to come—and, of course, with yesterday's great Australia-United Kingdom free trade in-principle agreement—Inland Rail could not be better timed. As I mentioned, this budget commits to the intermodal freight terminal in Melbourne, which will support both the Victorian and the Australian freight networks. This means jobs—up to 1,350 during peak construction and a further 550 during peak operation. Quality infrastructure will boost productivity and underpin our communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Road safety, as I mentioned, is a paramount objective for us. I made this clear last year when I committed $2 billion over 18 months for road safety projects right across the nation. Half of this money was for projects with life-saving benefits to be finished by the end of this month. The 2021-22 budget builds on their success, delivering an extra $1,000 million—$1 billion—into what is now a $3 billion Road Safety Program. This new funding will support 4½ thousand jobs, taking the total number of jobs around Australia supported by the Road Safety Program to 13,500.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Water is the lifeblood of our nation. Through the National Water Grid, the government continues to deliver, boosting water security for communities and industries. In this budget there is up to a further $258 million for water infrastructure. This is good news for agriculture, good news for resources and good news for communities in general, particularly regional communities. Eight major construction projects have been completed since the establishment of the National Water Grid Authority less than two years ago. The government's ongoing investment brings the total number of projects in the pipeline—pardon the pun—to 30. The new $258 million commitment includes $160 million over the next two years for smaller-scale projects. Each project, large or small, means our regional areas are better serviced, more liveable and economically stronger. When regional Australia is strong, so too is Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional areas have been through it all in the past year and a half—drought, fires, floods, risks from the global pandemic and, now, even a mouse plague. But regional Australians are tough. They are resilient. Our people and industries have persevered in the face of great adversity—they always do—and I thank them on behalf of a grateful nation for what they have done during this global pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With strong support from the government's regional agenda, the regions are bouncing back. In fact, they're leading the way—they're leading the economic recovery through COVID. In 2020 a net 43,000 Australians moved out of the cities and into the regional Australian lifestyle. Regional Australia Institute research has found no fewer than 67½ thousand regional jobs—good, well-paying jobs—are available right now. Last year's budget was the strongest budget regional Australia has ever seen, and the 11 May budget delivered by the Treasurer built on that success and infrastructure for our regions.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you very much for the outline of the budget. I've got a few questions that I'd like to ask you. The first is a pretty simple one. Maths wasn't my strong point but I didn't do too badly at it at school. When you announced—I think it was in MYEFO, or it might have been in the last budget—that there was an additional $10 billion going into your $100 billion infrastructure program, you started talking about the infrastructure program being $110 billion. So that money got added in and we accepted that; you've now got a $110 billion infrastructure program. We may quibble about what you count as new money and all those things, but that's fine. But just before the budget you did a whole series of splashes on the Monday, and I think there was an extra $15 billion. So how come the infrastructure budget is now not $125 billion? You're not saying that, because the reality is you're the first infrastructure minister in a while to actually have a cut to your budget. The reality of the budget papers is that you've had a cut to your budget, which is pretty embarrassing for an infrastructure minister and Acting Prime Minister. It's there in the budget papers: $3.3 billion over the next four years has been taken out of your portfolio for infrastructure. You've made this big claim that you've got this extra $15 billion of new money coming in. Somehow or other there's this magic pudding that's suddenly shrinking, because it's not $125 billion, as you'd expect if you're adding more money to the program, but still $110 billion—and it's actually less than that. We now understand that it is in fact a rolling program, which basically means there are things coming in and things coming out. So this whole notion of $110 billion is a myth.</span>

It means you are the first infrastructure minister in over a decade to actually have a cut to your budget. You should be very proud of that! In simple language, this means the government is failing to deliver on its promises in terms of infrastructure over the next four years. Acting Prime Minister, how have you let that happen? You call it a rolling pipeline because the reality is that these promises kept rolling off the end into the never-never. They are cuts, pure and simple.</span>

In a year when hundreds of thousands of Australians have lost their jobs, frankly, you reached new heights in being unable to actually deliver. We wait to see how much the underspend will be in the 2020-21 financial year, and it would be terrific if the Acting Prime Minister could give us a hint as to what that might be.</span>

Why is it that you make the same big promises time and time again, always looking for the headline, but actually fail to deliver? Most of the projects that you have delivered are projects that Labor announced in our time in office. Go up there, cut the ribbon—we know how that works.

                    </a>  It's a big number, but it makes such a difference to our local communities, particularly in my electorate. I have five councils and they've all received decent funding under this program. Bellingen has received $2.52 million, Coffs Harbour City $7.1 million, Kempsey $5 million, Nambucca Valley $3.3 million and Port Macquarie an additional $8.9 million. These projects are making a real difference in our communities. In some instances, they're changing or saving lives.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give just a few examples from across the electorate. Nambucca, a great town, received $700,000 to construct major improvements in towns and public spaces right across the valley. They're not just beautifying the valley but providing better and safer access to pedestrians and mobility scooters. In my electorate nearly 30 per cent of people are over the age of 65. Proper access for mobility scooters and proper access on pedestrian walkways is so important to the older generation. Kempsey received $1.16 million to construct new bicycle paths and walkways, delivering improvements through the Macleay Valley and, importantly, supporting 56 local jobs during the construction. That's real recovery from the COVID pandemic. Port Macquarie, through the first round, received $1.8 million for seven projects which supported 31 jobs during rollout.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we can't forget the big-ticket items. This government has committed to funding 80 per cent of the Coffs Harbour bypass to the tune of $1.46 billion. It is a 12-kilometre stretch of the highway which will create 10,000 jobs during the life of its construction and, importantly, will every day take 12,000 cars off the road going through Coffs Harbour. That will allow the city centre to flow and to flourish into the future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of big-ticket items, at the end of 2020 we saw the opening of the final section of the Pacific Highway between Woolgoolga and Ballina, a 15-kilometre section between Devils Pulpit and Woodburn. When I was growing up in Kempsey, it was a good nine-hour trip up to Brisbane or down to Sydney—it's halfway between the two. You'd get in the back of the Valiant with the seven kids and off you'd choof.  </span>

I never had any problems with my fellow shareholders and directors in the business of investing in social or human capital or physical capital that made a difference in terms of our profitability and growth and that left a legacy. I can't say the same about this government, Acting Prime Minister. You are spending $100 billion on the government credit card, racking up a trillion dollars in debt but leaving no real physical legacy, and, as the shadow minister said, there are $3.3 billion in cuts to infrastructure in the budget—it is actually listed in the budget. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My home state of Queensland was promised $1.6 billion in new projects, but only 50 per cent of that is on this side of the forward estimates. Only $18.1 million of new spending in the budget is due in this first year—$18.1 million. That's about 18 kilometres of road. That's just extraordinary. <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Courier Mail</span> records that Queensland has the lowest amount per capita, at $307 per person, compared to $488 in Western Australia, $448 in Victoria and $367 in New South Wales. How does the Acting Prime Minister defend this paltry per capita volume of spending in the fastest-growing and most decentralised state in the country? How can you justify that, Acting Prime Minister? How is it that Queensland receives less funding per capita for infrastructure than any other state and territory? The government claimed they would provide $1.6 billion of new money for Queensland infrastructure projects. It's simply $18 million this year. Why is more than half of that money not actually listed across the forward estimates? It's off in the never-never. It's designed to get a headline before the budget but is not good enough to deliver on needs. </span>

Ipswich is going to grow from about 230,000 people to about 550,000 in the next 20 or 30 years. Acting Prime Minister, I mentioned this to you twice, showing bipartisan support. I expected $1 million in the budget. Why is there not $1 million in the budget for the business case in this really fast-growing area? It is the fastest-growing area in South-East Queensland. One in seven people in the country live in South-East Queensland, contributing $1 in $6 to our national growth, our national expenditure. It is simply not good enough. I ask you to think about that again, Acting Prime Minister, and to make a commitment to Ipswich. </span>

At the last federal election we said that, if we won the election, we would commit $500 million to kickstart that project. The coalition were opposed to the Ipswich Motorway upgrade until they had a road to Damascus conversion experience an election ago. Then, to the credit of the government—I will give the government credit and acknowledge this—they worked with the Queensland government on the Oxley roundabout to Suscatand Street section, and that has made a big difference in the lives of people in South-East Queensland, from Brisbane, Ipswich and beyond. That last section absolutely needs to get done, and there is no money in the budget. I call on you, Acting Prime Minister, to do the right thing. When are you going to do it? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, there is the Cunningham Highway. We've spent, since John Howard's days as Prime Minister, over $1 billion on the RAAF Base Amberley. Whoever is the base commander at the time and the CDF always talk about the fact that, no matter who's in government, we need to fix the road outside the RAAF Base Amberley. We need to do it, but there's no money for it in the budget. You know the government in Queensland is going to lodge a business case. They've said that they're going to lodge a business case. Why is there no money in the budget in relation to that? What about the Mount Crosby Road interchange? There's a bit of money for a scoping study. Why aren't you showing a proactive approach and working with the Queensland government to fix this most notorious section of road in Ipswich? It clogs up the Mount Crosby Road interchange all the way back to the Dinmore overpass. Why aren't you working with the Queensland government in a more proactive way to get that done? Why is there no money in the budget beyond a scoping study, $4 million? That's simply not good enough, Acting Prime Minister. It's the fastest-growing region in South-East Queensland, in the fastest-growing part of the country, and there's no money—almost none. </span>

The member for Blair and I turned up here on the same day, a while ago now. I did enjoy his contribution immensely because it was dripping with irony. It followed the contribution from the member for Cowper, who was talking about the completion for the first time of the Pacific Highway and the Coffs Harbour tunnel. I was in the member's electorate recently as I drove through there last Sunday. I actually stopped in his electorate and brought about $400 worth of mouse bait, but that's another story. Scooting along the Ipswich motorway, I nearly missed his electorate, the roads that have been funded were that good—you'll recognise the last bit of work funded by the federal government. I then scooted up the Toowoomba Bypass, the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing, which was designed and funded by our government. But I digress. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to talk about the support and role of local government and the relationship we have with local government. Just out of interest, through the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, the greater Brisbane area received $75 million, Ipswich itself received $14 million, Scenic Rim received $5 million and the Somerset council received $4 million. I understand they're not all in your electorate, but parts of them are. There's been considerable investment by this government right across Australia. I would really like to give a shout-out to the 537 councils across Australia because of the relationship that we've had, particularly during the pandemic. We understand that local governments, with their connection into the local communities, were the most effective way to get our stimulus measures into individual communities, because they understood the priorities. They had the workforce and, in some cases, a workforce that was underresourced because of the impacts early on of COVID. We saw right across the country great projects delivered by councils. But in some cases, even in the early stages of the pandemic, councils were reassigning staff that may have been underutilised to help out community organisations. We had council staff across the country delivering Meals on Wheels and helping out some of those more vulnerable groups. I need to make the point that, under this government, every year councils have received more funding from this government. Last year the FA grants—</span>

                    </a>  I'm glad you interjected, member for Ballarat. Last year funding for the FA grants increased by $50 million. We added another $2.5 billion through the LRCI program and are bringing forward, to help councils with expenditure through the FA grants, the additional funding through the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program and obviously the Roads to Recovery Program. This government has really supported councils but also appreciated the role that they have played. The member for Cowper was talking about some of the great projects in his area that were delivered by the council and funded by this government. They provided short-term stimulus in employment but also long-term benefits. Last week I was in Bourke, in my electorate. It mightn't seem much, but they have received several million dollars through the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure program. One of those projects was a modern public amenities block and an upgraded park. What we've seen with COVID is that, right across the regions, tourism is coming back to those areas. And local councils, with the assistance of this government, have stepped up and are improving the facilities and services that encourage people not only to go there in the first place but also to maybe stay there for an extra period of time. As the minister for local government, I'm very proud of the relationship we have with councils. I'm very proud of the councils themselves and I'm very pleased that this government has been able to provide more support for local government than any other government in previous times.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:26</span>):  Despite living in times of great uncertainty, we do know some things for certain. What we know for certain is that this government will always overpromise and underdeliver when it comes to its infrastructure commitments. I've got questions on behalf of my community for the Acting Prime Minister and his assistant ministers about what is happening with what the government is promising in Western Australia versus what it's actually delivering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great examples where the photo op and the flyer sound great but the government doesn't actually deliver is the Reid Highway and Erindale Road intersection. The government have committed $2 million for a business case, but then they have government members who don't tell the full story. I like the member for Stirling—he is a good human—but I do have to say that, when he sends out a flyer to his community saying something is underway and construction has started, it means either that there's a falsehood being passed on to the people in Western Australia or that the Acting Prime Minister has not actually told us the full story of where they are allocating government funds. I would have thought that in the budget we would get a clearer picture, but I went to look for the funding for the construction to start soon and nowhere in that budget did I find it. So one of my questions—I have many—to the Acting Prime Minister is: is that money in the budget or is the very good member for Stirling wrong? Have you let him down? Have you let the people of Western Australia down? I would love some clarity on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This wasn't what I intended to come in and speak on as we consider the budget in detail, but also I would like to seek an apology from the Acting Prime Minister to people who live in the CBD of Perth for suggesting that we should send a devastating mouse plague to the CBDs, to inner-city apartments where I have a lot of pensioners and older Australians retiring in my electorate. We are very fortunate that there is a large amount of space between where this plague is affecting communities and my electorate, but I do think we need to get an apology. I would ask that you take the opportunity when you're speaking on this to apologise for those remarks. I don't believe it was appropriate language, and I really am concerned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the real concerns I have is: what happens when it comes to city deals? It's been five years since the city deals were promised. Five years in the government's language is two Prime Ministers worth of time. The Perth City Deal was promised in 2017 under then Prime Minister Turnbull. We had a memorandum of understanding signed in April 2018. On the government's own figures, the Perth City Deal and the projects within it will not be completed until 2030, almost 10 years away. There was a great press release saying that there were going to be 10,000 jobs. I would like to ask: how many of those 10,000 jobs from the city deal, which took you four years to put together, have actually been delivered in Western Australia? If you put out a press release saying there are 10,000 jobs, I think you need to be honest about when those jobs are being delivered. If I look at the glossy brochure that the government put out about the Perth City Deal, again, there are lots of promises. But I want to know: how many jobs on the ECU campus that has been promised for the CBD have currently been delivered, and can the government confirm that the completion date is still 2024? Will this project and will WAAPA be in the Perth CBD by 2024, as promised in the government's own papers? If not, what has happened with the Perth City Deal? Will Murdoch University and Curtin University both be operating in the Perth CBD by 2023? We've got businesses in the Perth CBD who are crying out for more people to visit the CBD to boost their revenues and to boost their profitability, and they are relying on this to be delivered on time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to know what is actually happening with the WACA redevelopment. We've seen a lot of controversy around the swimming pool that was promised to people in East Perth in my electorate. The reality is that, even after four years of negotiations on this city deal, the document that was provided by the government says 'City of Perth: TBC'. Six months on, is the city deal still TBC for the people in East Perth who are relying on getting those facilities in their community, and when will the government sort out the finalisation of these negotiations? Finally, can you outline how many jobs are going to be created from the Perth Cultural Centre rejuvenation and the Perth Concert Hall— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  My question to the Acting Prime Minister is a relatively simple one.

                    </a>  Let me set the context for that question. Those opposite might laugh, of course, but it might have escaped their attention—particularly, perhaps, the member for Solomon, who's throwing scorn at the moment—that we're dealing with a one-in-100-year pandemic. There's been a recession induced by that pandemic. But, before that, the member for Solomon needs to know that, in my electorate, we were gripped by drought—two years, two seasons, complete failure. Do you know what happens when farmers go and get $1 million worth of seed and other inputs and pour them into the ground and it doesn't rain? They get a little concerned about that. When they have to do it twice, they get very concerned about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of that was happening as the global pandemic broke. I was at home in lockdown, in South Australia, thankfully. We've avoided most of the extended lockdowns. I was thinking back then that, in 12 months, we would have an unemployment rate of 12 to 15 per cent. I was petrified. I've lived through the best of times in Australia—26 years of unbridled economic growth. I was worried that my generation and those younger than me wouldn't understand what kind of hardship was coming, nor would they understand how to deal with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fast forward to now. Those opposite might think that there has been some miracle not connected to the decisions in this place—not that the outcome that we've achieved, so spectacular as it is, is all about decisions made in this place; it's a cooperation between every Australian, not just the people who get the great privilege of being in this building but the 24 million Australians who've put their shoulder to the wheel. But the reality is that that miracle didn't arrive in and of itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have more people in employment than we had prior to the pandemic. We have unemployment with a 'five' in front of it, and it's projected to go lower still. Those spectacular outcomes, not just in my electorate but across the nation, have occurred because we leaned in when we needed to. We were in the financial position to be able to make those decisions—our fiscal position was strong, as you know, Acting Prime Minister—but we were able to lean in, and we leaned in with lots of programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we had the drought support programs in my electorate, but if I'm talking specifically about the pandemic induced recession then I think one of the greatest measures was the partnership with local governments through the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program. I spent eight years on a local council, and I could have only dreamt of this kind of partnership. In my time, I think we attracted a grant of $1 million over eight years. Well, local councils in my electorate, over the course of three phases of this program, Acting Prime Minister, have received—wait for it—$53.8 million; 18 councils. But that's not the end of it. They've taken this funding and they've leveraged it with their own to put shovels in the ground to help employ Australians, leaving behind them, in the wake of that work, social capital.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That social capital runs to the priorities that councils themselves determined. Those priorities are a product of what their communities want. I know, as I know you know, Acting Prime Minister, that local councils, councillors and mayors are closest to their community. They know what priorities their community wants. They get to spend more time in their community than I get to spend in their community. I'm quite envious. I get dragged away to Canberra 20 weeks of the year; they don't. It's projects like the Pinnaroo aerodrome; the riverfront at Sturt Reserve; LED lighting across the city of Mount Gambier; a skate bowl and recreation park for Naracoorte; the Renmark town wharf renewal; and the Barossa United Football Club, a million-dollar playing surface. This is social capital. I repeat: Acting Prime Minister, are you aware of the positive impacts the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program is having in my electorate as well as the nation more broadly?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWL" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CLARE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blaxland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  I thank the Acting Prime Minister for being here as part of this process today. This is a process which is not always taken seriously, so your attendance here today is much appreciated. I want to talk about the big shift that we've seen in last 12 months of people from cities to regions. I know the Acting Prime Minister shares this view. People on both sides of the parliament have been working hard for years, for decades, to encourage more Australians to move from cities to regions. We've had some limited success in that regard over the years, but last year that happened big time. I think the statistics show that, in net terms, the number of people who moved from cities to regions last year was more than double what it was the year before. We understand the reason for that. COVID plays a big part in people wanting to move away from the cities to be safer but also in people being able to move to the regions because of the ability to work online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's great news to have more people moving to the regions, but one of the side effects of that we've seen is a massive increase in house prices in the regions. We've seen that right across the country. Comparatively, the jump in house prices in regional Australia has been double what it is in our major capital cities. Here are a couple of figures to demonstrate that point. In the last 12 months, house prices in Sydney have jumped by about 11 per cent; in regional New South Wales it's about 18.6 per cent, so almost double. In Victoria it's an even bigger jump. House prices have jumped in Melbourne by five per cent, but in regional Victoria by 13 per cent. It has almost tripled in that circumstance. In Brisbane, house prices have jumped by 10 per cent, but in regional Queensland they have jumped by 14.6 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you own a home in regional Australia, that's great news, but if you're trying to get into that market it's hard, particularly for young families living in regional Australia. They often think it's easier to live there, that it's easier to own a home there than in the big cities, but it's now getting comparatively harder. It's also getting harder to rent. I'm sure the Acting Prime Minister will know this, but in some parts of regional Australia it's now even hard to find a place to rent. The rental vacancy rates in some parts of regional Australia are almost zero. On the Fraser Coast in Queensland it's 0.2 per cent; Southern Downs is 2.3; Bundaberg is 0.5, Gympie is 0.4; South Coast of New South Wales is 0.7; Northern Rivers is 0.5; and Burnie in Tasmania is now 0.2. The list goes on and on. It's a trend. We understand why it's happening. The real question is: what can we do about it?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was in Coffs Harbour recently talking to the mayor there, Denise Knight. She told me the story of a place that was up for rent and there were 80 people lined up to go and look at the place. The person who won the lease had to pay the rent 12 months in advance, and took out a personal loan to do it. That's the circumstance that we're in at the moment. When you've got a circumstance where there's not much to rent and rents are going up, it increases the amount of homelessness. Mayors are now telling me they're starting to see street homelessness in parts of the country they have never seen it in before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's another story. In Byron Bay, a place where property is very expensive—the average price of a home in Byron Bay is higher than the average price in Sydney—there is no domestic violence refuge. The local police commander reckons that there are 400 women living in Byron Bay at the moment who are sleeping in cars. Here's another one. Today's <span style="font-style:italic;">Cairns Post</span> has a story about a young family—a dad, a mum, a young daughter and a dog—who were standing on the side of the road and were photographed with a sign that said, 'Wanted—two-bed rental, small family and a dog' and their mobile number. Acting Prime Minister, it's a story in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cairns Post</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>about a family you think might be hitchhikers looking for a lift, but they're just trying to get a place to live in, to rent. There's a genuine housing crisis in regional Australia, and there's a lot of work that needs to be done to fix it. I think we should all agree it's going to involve the cooperation and effort of federal government, state government and local government all working together. In today's <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> there's a story about the New South Wales government setting up a regional housing taskforce. In the same story Linda Scott, the head of the Australian Local Government Association, calls for investment in the construction of more affordable and social housing in regional Australia. There was a lot of money in the budget for a lot of things, but there was no additional funding for social and accordable housing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We committed, in the budget reply, to a $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund, which over five years would build 30,000 affordable and social homes across the country, where they're needed, and in particular in regional Australia. We know this is a problem. It's not good enough to say it's the states' job. They're doing something, but we need the federal government to do more. Will you invest more in social and affordable housing for regional Australia? </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Investment and Minister for Decentralisation and Regional Education</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  This budget places regional Australia at the heart of our national recovery, and rightly so when one considers that it has been regional Australia—our farmers, our food producers, our food processors, our miners, our regional small businesses—that have certainly done the heavy lifting during COVID-19. Our agriculture sector alone has gone from contributing $60 billion to our economy to contributing $66 billion in the past 12 months, and we've just posted a record in rural exports, as the member for Flynn knows. Strengthening our economy, creating jobs, landmark infrastructure investments, guaranteeing essential services, and building our capability as a nation are the hallmarks of this budget. We want to ensure that government, industry, research and education—all of those sectors—have a shared vision to drive the success of our regions and future economic prosperity. The Australian government is overseeing a historic amount of investment in the regions, in recognition of their strategic importance to our nation and to reflect the fact that increasing numbers of Australians are choosing to make a new life and home in regional Australia because of the unparalleled lifestyle opportunities. We've heard from the Deputy Prime Minister about the historic spend in regional infrastructure across all aspects of regional life, whether it be transport infrastructure, health and digital connectivity or supporting local business leaders. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the facets of this pandemic has been the great awakening by people in the cities about what lies over the Great Dividing Range, or the 'sandstone curtain', as we like to call it in the Central West of New South Wales. In 1851, when gold was discovered at Ophir, just outside Orange, there was a huge emptying of Sydney as its people crossed the mountains. Ships were abandoned in Sydney Harbour and there was one long line of humanity crossing the mountains to the goldfields. Last year a net 43,000 people moved to the regions from the cities. In the year before, the number was 19,000, so it has more than doubled. We are seeing a greater migration today from the cities to the country than we did back in the days of the gold rush. Earlier this week, for example, the Deputy PM and I inspected the site for the $2.03 billion boost to the Great Western Highway. This is a huge project for our area, and it is a project very close to the hearts of the people of the Central West. We know how congested that road is getting. Normally, the trip from Sydney to Orange takes about 3½ hours. Over Easter it took my two daughters nine hours plus to get home, and everyone in our area has a horror story like that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why it's so important to get projects like this up and running and moving. There'll be shovels ready and sods turned next year because projects like this bridge that great divide between the city and the country, reducing travel times and making the roads safer. Also, by forming the key links between city and country, we help to built capacity in regional Australia—in this case, central western New South Wales—and we set our regions up for jobs, we set them up for growth and we set them up for prosperity. This is on top of the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, which has seen millions and millions of dollars allocated for upgrades. In my electorate, it is more than $8 million and, in the current financial year, $38 million over the forward estimates. These projects are critical to our future and our prosperity, and they help support the liveability in our regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the budget, we're also investing $50 million through round 6 of the Building Better Regions Fund to build community, workplace and innovation hubs across regional Australia. This has been very warmly received across the regions. These hubs will deliver jobs and significantly help to boost local investment and bring a range of benefits to small businesses, remote workers, community organisations and travelling professionals alike. Obviously, we'll also be supporting the relocation of public sector jobs to our regions through our cross-agency taskforce, which was also delivered through this budget. This budget delivers for regional Australia, and long may it continue.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:46</span>):  There are just a couple of comments I want to make about some of the contributions of those opposite. I think, in particular, the issue that my colleague mentioned about regional housing is a really gaping hole. It's an absolute gaping hole in this budget, and I think that every single one of us who represents a regional community, of which there are many in this House, knows exactly what is happening with regional housing at the moment. The fact that the government has spent $100 billion, has a trillion dollars worth of debt and has been unable to solve—in fact, its own policies have exacerbated—the problem of regional housing across this community is actually something the government should be ashamed of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of local government, we, of course, have always welcomed the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, because it's based on a program that we had during the global financial crisis, the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. Some of the members who are here are new and may realise that millions of dollars went to local councils through that program at the time, and we're very pleased that the government has modelled its program on that. But what you did was freeze financial assistance grants. You ripped a billion dollars out of local governments, and that has had a cumulative effect on them. That's one of the problems that you have at local government level at the moment. Communities—in particular, regional communities—have shrinking rates bases, or rates bases that are under pressure for a variety of reasons, and you froze the financial assistance grants, and that has been a cumulative problem for local government. Whilst they welcome what you've put back in, they're also really devastated by what you ripped out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say one thing about what we see in this budget with the $3.3 billion worth of cuts: where is the legacy? Where is the legacy of this government when it comes to infrastructure? Where are the state-by-state icons—the cross river rails, the metronets, the regional rails or suburban rail loops? Where is that legacy? There isn't one. There is a trillion dollars in debt, and you have to ask yourself: after eight long years of this government, what has been the point? What's the point of them?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to look at an absolute example of where this government has overpromised and then underdelivered, you only have to look at the Urban Congestion Fund and, in particular, the commuter car parks. This Urban Congestion Fund was announced in 2018. That's a while ago now. It was in the 2018 budget. It was $4.8 billion, part of the government's so-called $110 billion or $103 billion program—whatever it is now; I don't know what it is. This fund of $4.8 billion is to support upgrades to the urban road networks et cetera.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How do you characterise the success of this program? In budget estimates last month, $4.8 billion was announced—it was topped up a bit but was announced in 2018—and they've spent $340 million of it. With all the congestion in Australian cities, how is it that the government has only managed to get $340 million out the door? Initially the government intended to spend $1.2 billion through this fund next year, but that's now been revised down by almost a billion dollars, to $775 million. Why is that? Why has that occurred? An ANAO report is about to be released—we're awaiting that—into the commuter car parks. Just weeks before its release, we've seen the latest development in this rolling fiasco of a program. We saw announcements that commuters at Brighton Beach, Balaclava, Mitcham, Kananook and Seaford will basically be left circling the block looking for a car park in order to get to work. In estimates, departmental officials couldn't guarantee that there would be other car parks. Acting Prime Minister, we'd like to know: what are the other car parks; what are the other Urban Congestion Fund projects that you're planning to cancel? This fund has been an absolute failure, frankly. Minister Fletcher was brought in to clean up the mess of this particular program, which means there will be further cuts to it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to mention briefly that just last week I was in Newcastle checking out the site of the M1 extension to Raymond Terrace. The Commonwealth has announced $1.6 billion of funding for this project, but work is not forecast to begin for another two years. The $1.6 billion is well beyond the forward estimates. Commuters need that road fixed now. I'd like to ask you, Acting Prime Minister: when are you going to get on with the M1 extension to Raymond Terrace? </span>

We have looked at many projects, and jobs are being done. There's still some work outstanding. I can cite, for instance, the John Peterson Bridge outside Mundubbera on the Durong Road. It's been an atrocious bridge, with a left-hand S-bend over the Boyne River. We're soon to get that started. But, of course, we rely on the TMR, the Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads, to actually organise it and get the job done. They have scoped the bridge, they have costed the bridge, and now all we need is for them to start that particular project. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are eight councils in my electorate, including Central Highlands Regional Council in Emerald, the Banana Shire Council, parts of the Rockhampton shire, parts of the Bundaberg shire, North Burnett, South Burnett and the Aboriginal town of Woorabinda. They are supported through financial assistance grants, FAGs, which can range from anywhere between $6 million and $12 million a year; our Roads to Recovery Program; and our Bridges Renewal Program. That's a great help to these small councils, who don't have the rate base to support their roads. A lot of the roads in those council areas are still dirt roads. A lot of roads go across black soil. It's good farming country. Whether they are sealed roads or dirt roads, they do need maintenance on a regular basis. That's what's happening between Bauhinia Downs and Moura at the moment. We're flattening out the roads and redoing the edges. There are ongoing projects right across Flynn. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The famous worst road in Australia goes from Springsure to Tambo. We have put aside $40 million to get that 250 kilometres of road sealed. The $40 million will go a long way to adding to the 50 kilometres that is already sealed. It will be an ongoing project. It will link the west to Central Queensland and into the port of Gladstone. You can drive any sort of truck, a B-double or a road train, from Clermont to the Townsville port, but you cannot drive a B-double from Emerald to Gladstone port, which is one of the biggest ports in Australia. But we're working on that too. That will be fixed with the Springsure to Tambo road and the other roads along the Capricorn Highway. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've done a lot of work. There's work underway now at Three Moon Creek, which is between Eidsvold and Mundubbera. Deep Creek, between Gayndah and Mundubbera, has just been completed. There's the Valentine Creek Bridge west of Gracemere. The last wooden bridge on the Capricorn Highway was replaced. The Capricorn Highway goes from Rockhampton right through to Longreach. That was the last wooden bridge to be replaced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there are other projects. When I first became a member of this House there was a single-lane road between Gracemere, which is a town of about 8,000 people just outside of Rockhampton, and Rockhampton. That is now a four-lane highway. I can tell you that the people of Gracemere and anyone who uses the Capricorn Highway are very pleased with the project. We've got plans to do a ring-road around Rockhampton, as is the case with towns up the coast along the Bruce Highway. They bypass towns like Gympie. The Rockhampton ring-road will take in some parts of Flynn around Alton Downs and those areas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's all happening, but it does cost a lot of money. The federal government are prepared to spend that money because they know that, if the regions are doing well, we need these roads for our beef industry and our agriculture industry. As a previous speaker said, our agriculture industry has grown even in these tough drought times—from $60 billion to $68 billion. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  I want to go to some state-by-state specific projects, but before I do that I want to talk a little bit about airports and in particular one airport I know the Acting Prime Minister will know well—Wagga Wagga Airport. I flew in there about a month ago. It's a pretty flash-looking airport.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms CATHERINE KING:</span>
                    </a>  We could have. You weren't in town at the time, Acting Prime Minister. It's a pretty flash-looking airport. I note the local member says that he's not in favour of this airport being handed over to the council. The council is experiencing significant problems. He has made the claim that the RAAF base would disappear from Wagga if the council has the airport. We know that many local councils had airports in their areas handed over to them over 30 years ago at no cost. The Wagga council is pretty keen for that to occur. I must admit that I'm at a bit of a loss as to why the Acting Prime Minister doesn't think this is a good idea. We have seen it happen in other areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise very much the contribution to Newcastle Airport and congratulate as well the member for Paterson for her great advocacy in making sure that the Acting Prime Minister was aware of that and ensured that that project was funded. I see that great partnership over Newcastle Airport between two councils that works very successfully. I ask the Acting Prime Minister why he thinks that's not possible for Wagga Wagga Airport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the state-by-state breakdown, there's so-called new money in this budget. I say 'so-called new money' because we know that there was a $3.3 billion cut in the heart of the budget to infrastructure funding. You are the first infrastructure minister in over a decade to have a cut to his infrastructure budget. For example, the government claim to be spending new money in the Northern Territory, but 99 per cent of the money promised the day before the budget is actually not in the budget at all. It's off in the never-never. It's quite an achievement—only one per cent of that new money is to be spent in the Northern Territory over the next four years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For Victoria, 87 per cent of its promised new money isn't in the budget. The $2 billion commitment for the new intermodal freight hub in Melbourne's north or west is off budget. We don't know the location yet. I know there's talk between Truganina and Beveridge. We also don't know how it's going to be funded through the budget. Is it a loan? Is it an equity investment? Is it a grant? What is that money going to be? Can the Acting Prime Minister answer that, please?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In New South Wales, well over half of the newly announced funding isn't in the budget. The biggest ticket item for New South Wales, as we've heard, is the $2 billion for the Great Western Highway upgrade, which is off in the never-never. I'm sure local members will be disappointed to hear that it won't be finished until 2028 at the earliest, on the current projections of the government's funding. Why is it that you didn't contribute a single cent to new public transport projects in New South Wales despite them being of the highest priority for the New South Wales government? Is it because it's the same old tired government that left Queensland to go it alone on Cross River Rail?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In South Australia over a third of the money promised isn't in the budget. The biggest promise, the North-South Corridor, is nothing more than a reheated announcement. I think it's been announced eight times now. It had already been announced before, and even the South Australian government has admitted what the Deputy Prime Minister won't admit: that this is a renouncement. It's got several headlines out of it, but we want to know when work will actually begin on this project that has been talked about forever and ever and ever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to Tasmania I think the member for Lyons summed it up best, saying the announcements on the Midland Highway have been 'reheated more times than a dodgy takeaway'. Apparently the $64 million for the Burnie shiploader is fully funded. But, in reality, only $44 million is actually allocated to this project; it's $20 million short. We'd be keen to know where that new money is coming from.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we were last in government, we actually delivered on infrastructure, whether it was Tiger Brennan Drive or Arnhem Highway in the Northern Territory; $7.9 billion for the Pacific Highway; building the Hunter Expressway; doubling the federal infrastructure spend per Victorian; investing in the Regional Rail Link; upgrading the M80; duplicating long parts of the Princes Highway, east and west; or, in South Australia, building the Northern Expressway. Labor has a really strong legacy of delivering on infrastructure. This government just cuts it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  Today I rise to speak on some of the fantastic infrastructure projects that the Morrison-McCormack government are delivering in my electorate of Mallee. Our government understands that world-class infrastructure is vital to the strength and future prosperity of regional Australia. We believe that our regional communities deserve the best roads, the best community infrastructure and the best telecommunications possible. The 2021 budget is building on our government's track record of delivering infrastructure projects right across the country. This year's budget is delivering another $1 billion to the highly successful Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, taking this program to $2.5 billion—money that is investing and valuing our local regional communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The LRCI Program was a lifeline to Mallee councils during the year of COVID, when economic stimulus was desperately needed. Councils in Mallee received almost $73 million in the last year. Mallee councils have already put their money to good use and have delivered some outstanding projects across the communities. Swan Hill council has built new women's change rooms at the netball courts in Robinvale, where there were none, making weekend sport better and certainly more enjoyable for everyone in the community. Horsham council have used some of their money to upgrade community halls. The hall in Mitre has received an upgrade to their kitchen facilities. Taylors Lakes Hall, which is a focal point of the small community of St Helens Plains, has been fitted with a new roof to improve safety. Mildura council has spent another $2 million in cleaning up vital roads in the Millewa that were impacted by sand drift, allowing farmers and community members to travel safely. These are just some of the great projects that have been delivered thanks to this government's LRCI Program, with many, many more on the way in Mallee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the LRCI Program is not the only highly successful infrastructure program that our government is delivering—far from it. There is also the hugely popular Building Better Regions Fund. The 2021 budget has committed a further $250 million for a sixth round of the fund, which is $50 million more than the previous rounds. In May, it was my pleasure to take the Acting Prime Minister on a tour of Mallee, where he saw some fantastic projects that have been delivered by the BBRF. The Acting Prime Minister saw the massive roof that has been built over the Horsham Regional Livestock Exchange, a $3.7 million project that was delivered with $1.5 million from the BBRF. He also came to Mildura and toured the Mildura South Regional Sporting Precinct, which received $17.5 million from the BBRF. This transformational sports precinct is truly a world-class project. In fact, the Acting Prime Minister said that it was one of the best sporting complexes he has seen in the entire country. This precinct will attract events and athletes from all over Australia, and will be a community hub for the fast-growing city of Mildura.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that our government is committed to delivering outstanding infrastructure right across the country. We also have a key focus on safety, particularly for our road users. The Calder Highway is a vital corridor for all road users in Mallee. The 2021 budget has delivered an additional $15 million for the Calder Highway, bringing our total commitment to $75 million for this vital road corridor. Road users in northern Mallee are thrilled with the new overtaking lanes that have been completed between Mildura and Ouyen, increasing safety for travellers on this road and getting families home safer and sooner. We will see further safety upgrades up and down the highway, including at the Baileys Road intersection near Sea Lake.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether it is road safety upgrades or investment into much needed community infrastructure, our government is delivering infrastructure programs for regional Australians. These investments are also vitally important to our nation's recovery. Can the Acting Prime Minister please outline what further benefit is coming from the LRCI Program for regional Australia?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  Acting Prime Minister, I want to mention Inland Rail. This has the potential to be a very important nation-defining project. The last Labor government committed a considerable amount of money towards its design and construction. We were very supportive of it. We think it's got great potential. But we are very concerned that it has gone off the rails, if I can put it like that. This is a project that, much like the national debt, has seen blowout. You initially allocated $9.3 billion, and now it's $14.5 billion. I'd like to ask some questions in relation to it and how it impacts my local area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things I've got to say is that the consultation has been very poor. I've been at multiple meetings in my electorate in relation to this issue. Local farmers, local businesses and local constituents have raised concerns in relation to issues in terms of the direction, where the track will be laid, the fact that it will be very high, and the fact that some of these areas had been flooded quite significantly in floods in 2011 and 2013 across the Ipswich region. There has been a lot of comment, including by the Mayor of Ipswich, that this has a high impact but low benefit for our area. There is major concern about that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great things about our region is the Ivory's Rock conference centre, where thousands of people come for peace conferences, which contributes millions of dollars to the economy of Ipswich for the small businesses around Ipswich. People stay there. This has been a really important venue. We've got nothing like it in the West Moreton region. But this track will go 500 metres from the conference centre. You can hear the Ipswich Boonah Road from the auditorium at the back of the conference centre, so imagine the rail going that close. But when the Ivory's Rock consortium and group had been talking to your government and the ARTC in relation to it, and made submissions in relation to it, there was simply no offer or opportunity for noise attenuation. None at all. The camping grounds are right beside where the rail will go. I'm asking, Acting Prime Minister: what sort of contribution will be made to assist the Ivory's Rock conference centre, which is such a vital part of my electorate? How can you address the issue of consultation and support for local farmers across the Scenic Rim area, across the Lockyer Valley and across Ipswich in relation to this project? Can we get this project back to where it should be? I've got to say, I have never seen poorer consultation by any organisation in relation to any project in my 14 years in parliament. Can we do better? I urge you to do better. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development and Leader of the Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  The member for Ballarat, the shadow infrastructure minister, admitted at the start of her contribution that maths wasn't her strong point. Like her, I preferred English and history at school, but certainly Lyn Kensey and John Zoglmann were great teachers. John Egan was my favourite, but I digress. When you see the infrastructure rollout and the spending and funding that we are doing and compare it to what happened previously, it is like comparing chalk and cheese. Investment across our infrastructure pipeline has averaged $8 billion a year since 2013-14. Under Labor, it was $6 billion a year. I know that the member for Ballarat would realise and acknowledge that there is a $2 billion difference. More than 220 major Australian government funded projects are now under construction, with more than 124 projects starting construction in the last financial year. Since coming to government, 449 major projects have been completed. Many members have spoken about the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, a $1.5 billion program. More than $1.2 billion of that has been approved across 5,169 projects. This is such a boon, particularly for regional communities. Around $640 million has already been paid to councils and, as we heard from minister for local government, there are 537 of them. Under our $2 billion road safety package, announced in last year's budget, almost a billion dollars for approximately 700 projects has been approved under tranche 1. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We pay on milestones, and this is something that has been raised today. We don't spend money on works that have not been delivered. Labor might have because Labor paid for a lot of things that weren't ever delivered. I don't seek to bolster state budgets. What I do is seek to pay when projects have reached milestones or are completed. The states give us their estimated cash flows for how they think they can spend our commitments, and we make sure that the Commonwealth money is available. This means we can bring money forward if the states can deliver projects faster. I've said that, and certainly through COVID-19 I have made that promise. Here's an insight: I work well with state Labor infrastructure ministers and I know that the federal urban infrastructure minister does likewise. What we do is prudent financial management. Funding remains available and it's paid to state governments as soon as project delivery milestones are met. There's one other important distinction between Liberals and Nationals and Labor, and that is that, when we're in government, there's an 80-20 split as far as regional programs and projects are concerned. What we see when Labor is in government is that country areas miss out because there is a 50-50 split, so a lot of those projects are never funded. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Blair asked me about Queensland's investment share. I can tell the member that 20.7 per cent of the Commonwealth's investment in infrastructure will go to Queensland over the next decade, which is commensurate with its share of population, 20.2 per cent. If you look at that, they're actually getting more per head of population than they otherwise might have, or probably would have, under a Labor federal government—God forbid. </span>

The member for Flynn belled the cat when he said that the onus is on the Queensland government to get on with it. I work well with Glenn Butcher on water infrastructure. In good faith, we want to build infrastructure together and we will. Certainly, Mark Bailey and I have a very good relationship. Not a week goes by when there's no communication between our offices and between ourselves to get things done. Queensland can be, will be, one of the powerhouses for our recovery from COVID. We've committed up to $170 million to upgrade the Cunningham Highway between Yamanto and Ebenezer Creek, including the upgrade of key intersections at Yamanto and Amberley. </span>

When the WA state government has a $3 billion surplus in a time of financial crisis—in a global pandemic when other states are supporting health and economic outcomes—there is an onus on them to dig deep and spend a bit of money on infrastructure. My time is up. I am sorry about that because I had much more to say. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In this budget we've announced $15.2 billion in new and additional funding as part of our rolling 10-year $110 billion infrastructure investment. There is $12.8 billion forecast for the 2021-22 financial year in infrastructure grant expenditure, including these significant urban projects: $2.6 billion for the North-South Corridor's Darlington to Anzac Highway in South Australia; $380 million for the Pakenham roads upgrade in Victoria; $237.5 million for METRONET's Hamilton Street and Wharf Street grade separations; $178 million for the Gold Coast rail line capacity improvement from Kuraby to Beenleigh; $87.5 million for the M5 Motorway's Moorebank Avenue-Hume Highway intersection upgrade in New South Wales; and $44 million for the Rokeby Road-South Arm Road upgrades in Tasmania.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a great deal going on in urban infrastructure. It is similar in communications. In telecommunications we've committed $16.4 million under the Peri-Urban Mobile Program for better mobile connectivity in bushfire-prone areas on the fringes of our big cities. The peri-urban fringe is where the bush often directly interfaces with suburbs, creating bushfire risks for those who live and work there. The Peri-Urban Mobile Program, or PUMP, will complement our government's highly successful Mobile Black Spot Program by addressing mobile reception in areas along the peri-urban fringe that may have poor or no coverage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the digital economy area—and we've made significant announcements as part of our Digital Economy Strategy—we're providing $18.8 million over four years for a digital games tax offset. The global video games development market is worth around $250 billion, which is considerably bigger than the global movie sector. This tax offset will help Australian digital games developers to take a greater share of this global pie. It will drive investment and growth in the sector and help attract and build the creative digital skills needed in the economy. We already have significant skills in the film sector—and in special effects and many adjacencies—in businesses like Rising Sun Pictures, Animal Logic and so on. There's a considerable depth of skills in the sector in Australia already, many of which are very much adjacent to the skills required to be successful in the digital games sector. We already have a number of digital games businesses and we expect more will be attracted to Australia under this initiative.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the area of community broadcasting we've committed $8.8 million in this year's budget. Australia's 450 community radio broadcasters will benefit from this measure, securing the sector as a valuable source of local news and platforms for local stories. We've also committed $15 million over two years to the AAP Newswire service in support of public interest journalism in regional Australia under the Public Interest News Gathering program. That's in addition to the $55 million already provided by the government to regional broadcasters under the Public Interest News Gathering program.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our media bargaining code is a world-leading development responding to the way that digital platforms, like Facebook, Google and others, have driven fundamental changes in the way media content is produced, distributed and consumed. In this year's budget, we're committing $4.2 million to support the implementation of our news media bargaining code. That will enable the Australian Communications and Media Authority to fulfil its functions under the code of making sure news media businesses are fairly remunerated for the content they generate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're supporting the development and distribution of quality children's content, providing $11.9 million over four years to boost such content through the Australian Children's Television Foundation, on top of $20 million over two years from 2021-22, which we announced in last year's budget, that is directed towards the development, production and distribution of high-quality Australian children's content.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the arts, I, sadly, don't have time to do justice to the enormous amount of funding that we're committing to the arts sector. There is $85.4 million in this year's budget to support the preservation of Australia's cultural heritage for the benefit of all Australians. That will support the delivery of public services and programs to access our national collections, including institutions such as the National Gallery of Australia. I hope I'll be asked more questions about the arts in the course of today.</span>

In November 2020, in this place, and in the year before that, in September 2019, also in this place, I asked the minister what steps he had taken, including those taken in consultation with the Attorney-General and other relevant ministers, to address the issue of online racism in Australia. This was in reference to the terrorist atrocity committed by an Australian citizen in Christchurch and serious warnings about the rise of right-wing extremism, online hate speech and racism in Australia. I asked the minister if he would ensure that Australians, including Australians of Muslim faith, are kept safe online by amending Australia's e-safety laws or by driving the adoption of an EU-style code of conduct for countering illegal hate speech online.</span>

In 2020, the minister simply failed to answer the question. In late 2020, the minister finally released the exposure draft of the Online Safety Bill 2021 for public consultation. In its submission to the exposure draft, the Online Hate Prevention Institute stated:</span>

                    </a>  As I was saying before the division was called, there's been a massive shift in the work people are doing from regional Australia, and not only the residents of regional Australia. We are seeing a massive movement to the regions of people who understand they can work remotely and be just as effective, connected not only to the capital cities but internationally as well. NBN Co are doing their bit. In locations right across regional Australia they're developing business enterprise zones with enterprise level broadband at city prices, which is proving to be a real game changer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other areas, one of the programs that the government and I are particularly proud of is the Regional Connectivity Program. It's quite a broad program in nature. It is designed to deliver data—and, to some extent, voice—to regional areas where there is a greater need for capacity. From the first round, 80 locations right across Australia will now have access to high-capacity broadband to enable not only communications but a lot of technological advances, particularly in agriculture and mining, with remote monitoring of soil moisture, livestock and the like. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also affects safety in tourism. Last week I was in Tasmania, at the Tahune Airwalk. Tahune Airwalk is an iconic location in Tasmania, adjacent to the Warra ecosystem observatory. When the fires hit that part of the world a couple of years ago, there were actually 500 people on site, where there was no viable means of communication. So, in conjunction with TasmaNet, they will be delivering a wi-fi system across the complete Tahune Airwalk site and the adjoining Warra ecosystem observatory. They'll have connectivity not only for visitors but also for some of the valuable scientific research that is going on in that location. Right across Australia another 50 projects were announced from round 2, which was in the budget, with more to come. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More money has been allocated to connectivity in the northern part of Australia. We have also funded round 6 of the Mobile Black Spot Program. We've already funded 1,200 towers in the first five rounds. About 927 of those are up and running. Round 6 will come online later in the year. Round 6 will be designed to make sure that we've got mobile coverage in some of those thinner markets where it's less profitable for the telcos. It's important that people that live in those parts of Australia have the same level of connectivity as their larger regional and city counterparts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget further enhances our focus and the work that we have done on connectivity across regional Australia. There's always more to do. Regional Australians are very innovative. They have the ability to invent ways to use data as it becomes available, and this government recognises that fact. We are delivering high-capacity broadband and voice services right across regional Australia so that they can continue to carry this country out of COVID-19.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:53</span>):  I have many questions for the Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts today in this consideration in detail stage, and they all focus on the fact that this government is doing too little to support our artists in some of the most difficult times that they have ever experienced. We all remember, at the start of this pandemic, when the Prime Minister made the announcement about the restrictions on gatherings. That was in the early days, when the Prime Minister was still involved in decision-making on the pandemic. He completely removed himself from that, but that's a story for another day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why did this government race to go and do a press conference with Guy Sebastian in June last year but then wait until the end of the financial year to bother to start paying artists and supporting artistic and creative organisations in this country? The arts and entertainment sector in this country is worth $100 billion to the economy. Hundreds of thousands of Australians work in the arts and entertainment sector. Bar none, this last year has been the most difficult year for all of them. Yet this government was more interested in doing press conferences with Guy Sebastian—who had to end up publicly justifying that press conference—because this government, like it always does, was all about the announcement and not about the delivery. Not about actually supporting artists or actually getting the money out the door; only about doing the flashy announcement and getting the Prime Minister to do his photo op—not in a truck or a plane but with Guy Sebastian this time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is the government leaving artistic Australians behind? Why is the government leaving creative industries and creative businesses behind? Why did this government choose to deliberately design the JobKeeper program so that it excluded those working in the creative industries? The very nature of the creative industries means that the people working in them are often in short-term project work. It means that you're often in a job, a production or a film for not more than a few months. That's the nature of the work. It means it's unstable. I know that there are members on the opposite side who are well aware of how difficult it is to make it as an artist in this country. But that then begs the question: why did the government design a wage subsidy program that would mean that those Australians would be disconnected from the very organisations that they were associated with and disconnected from businesses?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to see exactly where the priorities lie for this government when it comes to the creative industries and when it comes to the department of the arts, if you want to see exactly what this government thinks and how much it values the department of the arts and the creative industries in Australia—if it actually valued it—it would still be a standalone department; it wouldn't be tucked away in a back drawer somewhere in the department of infrastructure and transport. What on earth do transport and infrastructure have to do with the arts, unless you're building a road to a new theatre? It boggles me. I don't get it. Why are we in this country turning artists into, somehow, a function of the department of transport and infrastructure? It makes no sense and it shows that the government doesn't value artists and doesn't value those people working in the creative industries in this country. If they did value artists in this country, they would show them the respect of having their own department, not burying it in the back drawer of the department of transport and infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final question I have for the minister is around the events sector. The events sector are absolutely on their knees at the moment. The events sector saw what happened as we came out of the pandemic second wave last year and had a little bit of stability over summer when they set up the Byron Bay Bluesfest, and then they had to cancel it after one COVID case. They saw the damage of what this pandemic can do to a massive event like that. What have they asked for from the government? They've asked for some sort of assistance around insurance so that, if they do schedule programs and they do schedule these massive events, there will be some form of insurance so that these companies aren't liable for everything. This government has been silent on it. Too little, too late. It's all about the announcement, not about the delivery, and then they bury the department of the arts in the department of transport and infrastructure, leaving Australian artists behind.</span>

These are the facts: no government has ever provided more funding for the arts than the Morrison government in 2021-22, with over $1 billion of funding for the arts. It's not Labor that has delivered that. Labor always talk a game about their support for the arts. It's the coalition that has consistently provided support for the arts.</span>

Why are we doing that? Because of the jobs that the arts sector can deliver. The jobs are not just within the arts. If you go and see a show, movie, exhibition or musical, you probably go to a restaurant, a bar or a cafe; you might stay overnight in a hotel; and you might jump on a plane to go interstate.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LITTLEPROUD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management and Deputy Leader of the National Party</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  It is a great honour to stand here today after what is another record budget for agriculture. This is the environment that we are putting around Australian agriculture despite all the headwinds that we have faced over the last 18 months, whether they be drought, fires, floods, cyclones or even COVID-19. ABARES estimated agriculture would hit $60 billion at the end of this financial year, and only yesterday they finalised that number to be $66.3 billion. That's an outstanding result. Of that, $47 billion is exports, and ABARES are estimating that next year those exports will get to just under $50 billion, but that was before we signed the free trade agreement with the UK 24 hours ago. So I'm confident that we will crack the $50 billion with a little bit of rain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our job in supporting agriculture's ambitious goal of $100 billion by 2030 is simply putting the environment and infrastructure around it, and that's why we've created the Ag2030 plan. Seven pillars are backed by money, not only put out in this May budget but also committed in the October budget. We committed over $400 million in that budget, and now another $850 million has been committed to support the seven pillars of Australian agriculture's Ag2030 plan. That's around making sure we can continue to diversify markets. Yesterday we got an in-principle agreement for free trade agreement No. 15. That's an outstanding result that allows our exporters to send their product into new markets, so it's an exciting opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also making sure that we're investing in the infrastructure to make it easy to export—that is, in technology; in streamlining; in digitising platforms, with a significant investment of over $300 million into digitising that platform we put in last year's budget, which is rolling out now; and in having more boots on the ground across the globe to make sure that we can get better market access. Our agricultural council in the UK played a pivotal role in the achievement of that announcement yesterday.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also significantly about protecting brand Australia. There was a $400 million investment under the second pillar, which is biosecurity. This is understanding there's an evolution of threats and how we evolve not only the management of them but also the technology around them. There have been 79 new biosecurity officer jobs created on the front line, plus we've invested in more paws on the ground and, more importantly, 20 new scientists. That means we can identify diseases and pests that may be found here quicker so that we can have real-time action in addressing them. That's important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also investing in technology. We're the first country to undertake 3D X-ray scanning for biosecurity threats to make sure that we identify those threats at ports and postal services. All 144 million parcels that go through Australia Post will now go through a 3D X-ray scanner, which we have created algorithms for, and artificial intelligence will be able to identify plant life, organic matter—even a live animal. New Zealand has signed up to that technology, and we hope to use it in airports as well very soon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also about the third pillar, infrastructure. There will be an extra $1½ billion for roads right across the country to make sure we can get products from paddock to plate as quickly as we possibly can. We're also looking at manufacturing opportunities going further through the supply chain with the $1.3 billion Modern Manufacturing Initiative. That also looks at some of the vulnerabilities in agricultural inputs. We need to understand, in a changing global environment, how to protect the agricultural inputs that are pivotal to Australian agriculture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also looking at our innovation systems, understanding the important role they play. Each year, $1.1 billion goes into research and development. There are 15 research and development corporations, and we're now looking to get back to first principles in streamlining them and getting value for levy-payers and taxpayers. We're making sure that the research we're doing isn't duplicated, that we commercialise it, and that it's rolled out and extended to the farm gate. That's why we've invested in eight drought innovation hubs close to farmers, so they can get this research and technology—touch it, feel it, use it—in regional universities, not in big cities that are too far away for many of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly, we're investing in our people. There is a significant investment in reducing university costs to encourage young people to get into agriculture. In reducing those university costs by 59 per cent we've seen a 120 per cent increase in ag courses at the University of Queensland this year. The environmental infrastructure we're putting around Australian agriculture is important. It's driving growth and driving our economy.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="281988" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McBAIN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:06</span>):  Farmers right across my region have proven time and again that they are some of the most resilient people I know. But they have been tested. For years, local farmers have modernised and amended their farming practices in order to meet the challenge of ongoing drought. Then they were hit with the devastating Black Summer bushfires which tore through our region. And over the past 18 months they have once again been tested and have found ways to continue their businesses despite multiple floods and the COVID-19 pandemic. So today I rise to raise awareness of the some of the ongoing issues that have continued to affect farmers in my region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make it clear that farmers are not sitting idly by expecting handouts. Eden-Monaro farmers are innovative and forward thinking, and they're doing everything they can to survive and prosper. Sheep farmers across the Monaro plains are worried about our dependency on China to keep the wool industry afloat. During COVID, China was the only market supporter for Australian wool as other buyer countries, including India, Italy and other European countries, ceased purchasing wool entirely. In gross terms, China purchases around 70 per cent of Australia's greasy wool. The wool industry therefore is significantly exposed to any potential disruption through trade tensions. Simply speaking, restrictions on Australian wool exports into China would likely have a crippling impact on the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of this, the shearing industry is significantly affected by labour shortages. We know farmers are hardworking, but across the entire area of the Eden-Monaro electorate they are having trouble finding labour, which means their workload is tougher and greater, and it clearly isn't sustainable. Even when workers have been found, sourcing rental accommodation for them in the region has been a barrier to employment. This isn't a new problem. We've been talking about workforce shortages in agriculture—and in hospitality, retail and tourism—for far too long. It's time for the government to get serious about addressing the issue. The government has failed to take responsibility for labour shortages. Farmers need this fixed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another concern for Eden-Monaro agriculture is the budget cuts to pasture and animal science in the CSIRO. Funding for research in these areas has been decimated in recent years, with key researchers now unable to pursue any fully funded CSIRO projects. Instead, they have to rely on funding partnerships with levy funded groups in order to obtain any budget leverage. This is having a detrimental effect on both the progressiveness and the amount of research and development occurring in agriculture right now, and it will hurt the Australian agriculture industry into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, cooperative farming groups, such as Monaro Farming Systems, play an important role in the development of sustainable and productive farming practices. The long-term security and consistency in having a paid executive officer is essential to keeping these groups going. But in 2018 the government cut federal Landcare funding, meaning that many of these groups are now unable to find long-term options for employing a coordinator to oversee admin, research coordination, marketing, member support, grant applications and acquittal. Even when farmers are banding together to get ahead, they are still being left behind. Farmers have been doing it tough, and it's tougher when the government isn't listening to their concerns. My questions to the minister include: is there a plan to deal with the potential disruption to the wool industry export market? Farmers need R&amp;D to continue so that they can futureproof their farms. Why has funding been cut from pasture and animal science at CSIRO, which funds essential research projects? What is the immediate plan to address labour shortages in the industry—and I mean immediate? Will the government commit to coordinator funding for cooperative farming groups so that our farmers can continue to get ahead?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:10</span>):  It's a privilege to speak today on behalf of the Liberal-National coalition government about its commitment to backing Australia's primary producers. As the member for Nicholls, I am proud to represent one of the most productive agricultural regions in country. Over the last 18 months, on a daily basis we've heard words and phrases like 'resilience', 'adaptability' and 'the ability to bounce back' being bandied about and those words were applied to all sorts of different situations. But I believe Australian farmers have written a book on resilience, adaptability and bouncing back. These characteristics just seem to be in their DNA. Despite one of the worst droughts in history, a global pandemic and natural disasters including bushfires, floods and now a mouse plague, we see agricultural production has hit $66 billion, with a target of $100 billion by 2030 firmly in its sights. Not only are our farmers resilient but they're also entrepreneurial. They are business men and women, land stewards and real conservationists, who at the same time embrace the cutting edge of science and technology to produce the greenest and cleanest food and fibre in the world, and they produce it for the world as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is right behind our farmers, and in this budget there's $233 million in new funding to help implement the National Soil Strategy and a $120 million investment in the national soil monitoring and incentives pilot, which will bolster our understanding of Australia's soil condition and improve how our soil can be managed. One of the most significant commitments to agriculture by this government is the $5 billion Future Drought Fund. This fund provides secure and continuous funding for drought resilience initiatives. It's no good running around in the middle of a drought trying to find the answers. It's a matter of investing in the better years to make sure that the answers are there, ready and waiting, for when droughts hit so that programs can be implemented. Each and every year $100 million will be made available from this $5 billion fund to support Australian farmers and communities to prepare for and become more resilient to the effects of future droughts. As part of this fund, the government is importantly investing in eight drought resilience adoption and innovation hubs across the country. The research and adoption program will help farmers and regional communities build drought resilience through investment and collaborative research, development, extension and adoption. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Victorian hub will be based in my electorate of Nicholls, at the University of Melbourne's Dookie campus. There are also going to be five nodes across Victoria that directly affect the diverse farming systems that the state has, as well as a node in the southern Riverina within New South Wales. These farming systems include dairy, horticulture, cropping, beef and sheep and viticulture. The hub nodes will be based in the north-west, the north-east, the south-west, Gippsland and the north-west irrigated areas. The program's going to be a grassroots program, so it's going to deliver practical solutions for our farmers, the communities that they support and the communities that support them. The University of Melbourne will be taking a direct lead in this, with Professor Tim Reeves and Professor Ruth Nettle as directors. Importantly, this is a collaborative program that draws upon the best of the best in agricultural research and resources in agribusiness within Victoria. Hub members are to going to include Agriculture Victoria, the Birchip Cropping Group, Deakin University, Federation University, Food and Fibre Gippsland, La Trobe University, Riverine Plains Inc., Southern Farming Systems and the Mallee Regional Innovation Centre. This is just another example of how this government is getting behind our farmers so that they can adopt the newest technologies that are available to them, increasing their ability to become even more resilient. In times of difficulty, that's when we need to have done all the work in the better years. It is very important that the government invests in the infrastructure that's going to enable our farmers to adapt with the latest technology but also to get their produce to market. Over the last few days we've seen increased trade deals, more and better trade deals, to give our farmers better markets and better farm gate prices. That is also critical to the nature of what we are doing. I congratulate the minister, Mr Littleproud, and the Treasurer for delivering this initiative within the budget, an initiative that backs our farmers and regional Australia.</span>

Farming and agriculture, right through to food and wine trails, are so important in the electorate of Gilmore. They are important for jobs, our community, local spending, tourism and more.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My first question to the minister is: in these strange world times of drought, bushfires, floods, pandemic and plague, and considering local farmers are already finding it difficult to find workers, can the minister guarantee that, after the latest Australia-UK trade deal, which will see 10,000 UK visa holders no longer required to work on Australian farms during their stay, local farmers will still have access to farm workers? The National Farmers Federation have expressed their concerns about when the ag visa will be delivered. My next question is: given the likely delay in the ag visa's implementation, how will the government manage that transition so that no local farmers will be left worse off? Given the government's plan to grow Australian agriculture to $100 billion by 2030, what plans does the government have to invest more in attracting, training, mentoring and retaining local workers on farms? Where is the strategic workforce plan for our agriculture industries?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given constituents in my electorate have seen so many disasters, when will the government provide a national response to the mouse plague? Not only are they contending with mice but farmers and people in Kangaroo Valley are also very concerned about the ever-growing carp plague in the beautiful Kangaroo River. What are the government's plans to address the ever-growing problem of carp in our waterways?</span>

The way the AWU is demonising Australian farmers with this generalisation that they are exploiting workers is disgraceful. If you want to generalise, we could generalise about the union movement.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AMN" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:19</span>):  Mr Deputy Speaker Freelander, I appreciate you bringing calm to the chamber. I would like to update the Federation Chamber about the budget that has been so well received. In the last two budgets since 2019 there has been $2 billion of new spending on the environment, reflecting this government's deep commitment to secure our incredible natural places, not just for now but for generations to come. We will strengthen our economy and create jobs. We will also deliver practical on-the ground outcomes and long-term national reform for our environment. We are building a more resilient and secure Australia. As part of the 2021-22 budget there's $486.3 million in new environmental funding for oceans, biodiversity, recycling and waste, and climate resilience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Oceans and the Great Barrier Reef feature nationally and internationally. We're investing $100 million in an oceans package that strengthens our global leadership in marine management and ocean protection and that boosts regional employment. It includes $30 million to restore coastal marine ecosystems that draw carbon out of the atmosphere—mangroves, seagrasses and tidal marshes; $39 million to expand our marine park network into the Indian Ocean and protect 45 per cent of Australian waters; over $11 million to incorporate sea country into Indigenous protected areas across nine locations; and $18 million to target practical actions to protect our iconic marine species.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This builds on the Morrison government's $67 million investment in last year's budget to tackle the impacts of ghost nets and plastic litter, to enhance the management of Australian marine parks and to re-establish oyster reefs all along our coastline. We'll also continue to assist tourism operators on the Great Barrier Reef by waiving the environmental management charge for a further 12 months. We know, coming out of COVID, that the tourism operators that showcase our beautiful natural environment have had some tough times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must mention the Australian Climate Service. This service will bring together and analyse information from the Bureau of Meteorology, CSIRO, Geoscience Australia and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, informing the work of Emergency Management Australia and the new National Recovery and Resilience Agency. That's nearly $210 million of new money to do something that is genuinely world-leading—to provide the intelligence and localised mapping capability for deep understanding at local communities about the impacts not just of disasters but of climate change. You hear the expression 'build back better'. We really mean it with the Australian Climate Service. It will give us the tools and the data that will be vital for the future. It will fill a gap. It will be well respected and I suggest copied internationally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The assistant minister will talk to the Federation Chamber about our exciting recycling and waste agenda. We're of course investing in the reforms to the EPBC Act. They were backed in in this budget with $9 million to establish and fund the operation of an independent environment assurance commissioner; $2.7 million for a pilot regional plan for a priority development region in partnership with a state or territory, and everyone wants these regional plans to succeed; funding to support stakeholder engagement for Indigenous cultural heritage protection, so necessary after the Juukan Gorge disaster; and $17 million to maintain improved assessment times under the EPBC Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will invest $29 million in additional funding to protect native species and their habitats from invasive pest animals and weeds. It's not the whole substance of our work with threatened species and biodiversity, but it's an important addition because when you get the Commonwealth and states investing at the same time, particularly at the interface between private and public land when it comes to invasive pests, that's when you can get some fantastic results. Working with communities and having their input as well is incredibly important. The new funding complements existing investment in bushfire recovery for native species and habitats, safe havens and the new 10-year Threatened Species Strategy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new budget measures are in addition to the Morrison government's continued commitment to the environment in Antarctica, our Recycling Modernisation Fund, the second phase of the National Environmental Science Program—there's $149 million in that—and the continued rollout of our bushfire recovery funding, our heritage funding and our regional land partnerships. Our budget demonstrates our continuing approach to practical on-the-ground action to protect, preserve and enhance our incredible natural environment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:24</span>):  This is such an important portfolio. Australia is a world leader in mammal extinctions. It's a very, very sad distinction to hold. Of course, the world is facing up to the need for diversity protection and for protecting habitats. It is to be hoped that Australia doesn't get left behind. Recently, the second 10-yearly review of the nation's principal environment laws, the EPBC Act, was conducted. The review was led by Professor Graeme Samuel, appointed by the government to conduct this review. Professor Samuel recently released his final report of that review. In that report, he recommended a staged approach to environmental reforms. He set out a first-stage approach, which was very considered and very thoughtful, but unfortunately the government seems hell-bent on completely ignoring it, and is instead dusting off some 2014 provisions from a bill that was unsuccessful in that year, and some proposed written standards that were prepared in support of that bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the minister mentioned, the budget does go to EPBC reform. There are some matters in the budget for EPBC reform. But it seems very clear that the minister and the government's approach to EPBC reform does not enjoy broad support. As I said, the bill and the standards that they've produced really reflect the propositions that they put forward in 2014, propositions that a number of us who were in the parliament at the time spoke against. I was one of them. I spoke about my concerns about that 2014 bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where we are now is that, in his final report, Professor Samuel put forward, amongst a suite of proposed reforms as a first stage of reforms—and of course he proposes a staged process—some recommendations in respect of national environmental standards. This is, as I say, an important review. It's a review in which Professor Samuel said that the current environmental trajectory is unsustainable, the natural environment is in decline and the threats are growing. This is a respected person in the Australian community, an experienced regulator, someone hand-picked by the government to give them advice. He has now done that and he's said those things. As I said, amongst the first tranche of reforms he proposed, he put forward some recommendations about national environmental standards. The government has disregarded those.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of people with significant expertise and history in environmental protection have expressed some serious concerns about the government's proposed environmental standards. There was a Senate inquiry in relation to the government's proposed bill. In the submissions to that inquiry, Professor Craig Moritz, from the Australian Academy of Science, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Regrettably, the standards that are now proposed—these interim standards—are not scientifically credible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Brendan Wintle, from the Threatened Species Recovery Hub, said this bill takes us back. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We're taking steps down a pathway, and we have no map. We haven't got a clear strategy or response from the government about how they're going to address Professor Samuel's recommendations; we're just stepping out into the void, as far as I can tell.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Helene Marsh, Chair of the EPBC statutory Threatened Species Scientific Committee, in response to a question about whether she was concerned, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Yes, I am. The Threatened Species Scientific Committee was very extensively involved with the Samuel review. We worked with him, we met with him several times, we put in two very extensive expertise based submissions, we spent a lot of time with his team and we worked very closely on the standards. I don't think that his standards are perfect but I think that legally enforceable, outcome focused, granular standards are really, really important. I am disappointed that the proposed interim standards don't reflect the considerable amount of work that was done towards outcome focused standards. Professor Samuel's report only included a number of them, but he made a very clear list of the suite that was needed in the first instance. The Threatened Species Scientific Committee very much supports the development of the full suite of outcome focused standards as a critical step in moving forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… I was very surprised, particularly as we had been consulted so extensively … and had put in so much work … with great enthusiasm, because we saw this 10-year statutory review as such an opportunity for change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So my question to the government is: will they now listen to the experts, listen to the review panel, put aside their ideologically driven changes from 2014 and come back with something sensible for the opposition and the community to consider?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:29</span>):  As a farmer, I understand firsthand the impact that pest animals can have on the land, and I welcome the government's continued commitment to supporting farmers and land managers to manage established pest animals and weeds. The new $29.1 million investment will help protect native species from the significant threats which invasive pest animals and weeds present to our natural environment. They not only reduce agricultural productivity but also damage natural resources. The challenge that feral cats present to Australian wildlife was a matter explored recently by the Standing Committee on the Environment and Energy, of which I'm a member, and the committee's recent report <span style="font-style:italic;">Tackling the feral cat pandemic: a plan to save Australian wildlife</span> made a number of recommendations on how the impact of feral cats on our native wildlife and ecological communities can be managed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I'd like to highlight a very successful program in the northern Tasmanian region of Bass, which I represent. Over the past 18 months, the West Tamar Landcare group, funded to the tune of $20,000 through the Communities Environment Program, have tackled the issue of cat predation on native wildlife and cats as vectors for diseases such as toxoplasmosis in the lower west Tamar region. I'd also like to note the contribution of West Tamar Council, NRM North, Tamar NRM and Cradle Coast Authority NRM, who have provided in-kind support for the project. The project area is situated at the mouth of the Tamar estuary and is an important breeding and habitat area for nationally listed fauna species, including the hooded plover, Tasmanian devil, spotted-tail quoll and eastern barred bandicoot. These species and other local wildlife such as wombats, native birds and globally migrating shorebirds are highly valued by local residents. The project undertook a combined strategy, which included working with West Tamar Council and the state government to promote responsible pet ownership; reminding owners to keep pet cats contained and safe; encouraging and providing incentives to residents of the project area to desex and microchip their cats; and running a coordinated trapping program in rural areas and Crown reserves, consistent with the Cat Management Act and the national guidelines for cage-trapping feral cats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In short, the project, run over two seasons from December 2019 until this month, has trapped across the whole of the 6½ thousand hectare project area, including in national parks and reserves with appropriate consent; has removed close to 60 feral cats from farm and bushland areas, resulting in the protection of up to 6,000 native animals and birds from predation each year; has given the landcare group the opportunity to learn and share considerable expertise in humane and ethical trapping of animals and to generate associated community awareness; and has generated widespread support for the project and awareness of local native wildlife. The project has been a collaborative effort and has also given the West Tamar Landcare group the opportunity to build strong relationships with the West Tamar Council and NRM North. Through this partnership, the group have sought to have the project area declared a cat management area under the state Cat Management Act and to secure ongoing support for a continuation of the trapping program in future years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most pleasing results of the project was the discovery of Tasmanian devils, quolls and bandicoots in the project area, with the numbers of these animals trapped and released in the second year of trapping roughly double that in the first year. It's particularly pleasing to note that the Tasmanian devils trapped and released were all healthy and showed no visible tumours, and, as some devils were half grown, it indicates that breeding is occurring between healthy devils in the area. In addition to reports of improved lambing percentages, there has also been considerable anecdotal and actual evidence that the removal of cats has increased native animal and bird populations, including those of quolls and bandicoots, which Minister Ley and I were lucky enough to witness firsthand earlier this year in the Tamar region when two 12-week-old bandicoots were released back into the wild as part of the program, supported by $1.7 million in federal government funding, to protect the eastern barred bandicoot.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure that the project has a sound legacy and ongoing community understanding and support, the project committee is now considering a further public education campaign around responsible cat ownership through public art activity and signage using public spaces and buildings in some of the key towns in the lower west Tamar area. This project is a perfect example of how government funding for community run and owned programs can make a tangible difference to the environment. I'd like to thank Peter Voller, Vanessa Bleyer, Greg Squires, Jane Shapter and all those involved in the project for their fantastic work. Can the minister expand on how the federal government is supporting these on-ground efforts to fight the significant impacts of feral animals and weeds?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:34</span>):  I'm glad to be able to ask some questions about the environment portfolio. There is a broad question that sits over the more specific queries—that is, whether the minister believes it's the core responsibility of that role to stand up for and fight for the protection of Australia's environment and Australia's heritage. What we seem to get instead is an approach of excusing or defending a number of areas of unacceptable environmental degradation and neglect; an approach that gaslights and directs opprobrium against Australians who care about and campaign for the health of our environment; and an approach that assumes, somehow, it's the job of the environment minister to consider first and foremost the needs of industry, when industry—I'm pretty sure, coming from Western Australia—is quite confident in its ability to argue its own cause in a way that endangered species are not. In any case, of course, industry has a number of ministers responsible for its specific issues. Shouldn't the Minister for the Environment be an unapologetic champion for the interests of the Australian environment, especially when you consider that our land and our sea have already endured very significant harm and are, in the words of the government's own appointed reviewer, on a trajectory of further decline? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was only a year ago the Juukan Gorge tragedy occurred, with destruction by Rio Tinto of First Nations heritage of immeasurable value. That fiasco had several components, including failures by this government, especially in its administration of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. What has occurred since that tragedy to make sure it never happens again? The government previously committed to reviewing the ATSIHPA by December 2017. That didn't happen. That was 3½ years ago. When is the government going to review and reform this critical and underperforming safety net for the protection of Indigenous cultural heritage of immeasurable value? Why isn't the government looking to include Graeme Samuel's interim standards for national and World Heritage protection in its reform of the EPBC Act? Is it really acceptable that the department's timetable for work on this issue, after Juukan Gorge, with respect to heritage protection under the EPBC Act, only includes the following: for the first half of next year 'to continue engagement on modernisation of Indigenous cultural heritage protection' and then, in the first half of the following year, all the way into 2023, 'to establish a pathway for implementing modernised Indigenous cultural heritage protections released'. So, 3½ years from the time they'd committed to the ATSIHPA review and reform in the first place, we now have to wait another two years just to get to a pathway. All the while, Indigenous cultural heritage is at risk. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's only two weeks until the government's export ban on mixed plastics comes into force. There's understandable concern about what will actually happen to mixed plastic waste, because the government has failed to ensure we have sufficient infrastructure to recycle and reprocess the waste we've previously sent to other countries. There's no question whatsoever that the government took way too long to come to Labor's position, which was that some direct investment was going to be required. The 2019 Australian Recycling Investment Fund was a joke. It was a complete failure. Not a single dollar was advanced. The face-saving Recycling Modernisation Fund, which followed on its heels, has only advanced $4.5 million to date. It's created no additional plastic reprocessing capacity. There is now a real risk that, beyond 1 July, we will see mixed plastics sent to landfill or otherwise stockpiled, or they will need the benefit of an exemption so they can be exported. In the case of stockpiling, we know that presents fire risks. The government received a report that pointed out that the risk of this occurring wasn't low. Minister, what contingencies are in place to deal with this possibility, and can you guarantee that, beyond 1 July, mixed plastics will not be sent to landfill or dangerously stockpiled? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, the minister listed the Australian sea lion as endangered under the EPBC Act. It's one of 283 listings of threatened or endangered species under this government, a coalition government who kicked off by reducing Labor's network of marine protected areas by 50 per cent, a coalition government whose failed Threatened Species Strategy did not include any focus on marine species. Now we're told that might be corrected under the new strategy, which has just been delivered, several months too late. But the new strategy doesn't have any details, doesn't have any actions, doesn't have any targets and doesn't have any apparent new resources. Minister, in your speech to the Press Club, you accused your opponents, which presumably includes all Australians who rightly want to see proper protection of our environment, of being too focused on activism rather than outcomes. Isn't it the outcomes that are the problem? Isn't that why people are moved to activism? Minister, when are you, as the Minister for the Environment, going to exercise that responsibility rather than being an apologist for a government that has presided over serious and steepening environmental decline?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Waste Reduction and Environmental Management</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  Thank you to all honourable members for their contributions and their questions. In answer to some of the questions from the member for Fremantle just then, our minister is an unquestionable champion for Australia's environment, as is the whole government. I refer members opposite and everyone who is passionate about the environment and its protection in this country to the minister's Press Club speech given just yesterday, which was an incredibly passionate, thoughtful and powerful speech.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Fremantle has asked questions about the direct investments of our government into the recycling sector. I'd like to inform all members that, in the 10 years before this federal government stepped more heavily into waste and recycling policies with the creation of my assistant ministry in 2019, the total Commonwealth government spending over those 10 years was $30 million. So the average yearly expenditure in this area by federal governments, including many of the years when those opposite were last in government, amounted to approximately $3 million per year. Since 2019 our government has committed over $500 million. So, if my rough maths is accurate, we're talking about something like a 10,000 per cent increase in funding for waste and recycling policies, investments, infrastructure and projects over the last couple of years compared to the years when those opposite were in power. I know the vast majority of the waste and recycling sectors are very supportive of our initiatives and funding. They're voting with their wallets and their feet in making their own co-investments in this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I also very quickly speak to the question from the member for Bass regarding feral pests and weeds. I inform the member that $29.1 million of additional funding is being invested in programs by this government to protect native species from the horrific threats posed by invasive pest animals and weeds in our natural environment. This funding is part of the broader $400 million biosecurity package announced in this year's budget, and the Commonwealth government will be working with natural resource management groups and Indigenous rangers through on-the-ground action and research to deliver new and innovative measures. It was really great to hear from the member for Bass about the success to date of one of the CEP projects along these lines being rolled out in her electorate of Bass.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new funding that was announced in this budget complements existing investments in bushfire recovery for native wildlife and habitat, safe havens and a new 10-year threatened species strategy. This year's budget delivers on the next stage of the government's economic plan to secure Australia's recovery from the pandemic, including, as I was referring to earlier, significant reforms, significant initiatives, significant co-funding and significant direct investments in the waste and recycling sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge and congratulate the member for Bass for her leadership and her interest when it comes to waste and recycling policies, her interest in the circular economy and her role as the co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Waste and Recycling. She truly is a waste warrior. I believe the member for Corangamite opposite is the other co-chair, so due credit to the member there as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having legislated the world-leading laws to end the export of contaminated waste streams like mixed plastics, our government has been incredibly busy in driving a massive transformation of this sector in our nation. In total, with the direct funding that's being provided by this government, the co-funding that's being provided by states and territories and the co-investments that we've been able to leverage from industry, we're now talking about close to a $1 billion transformation of Australia's waste and recycling sectors. This level of investment being made in our country in a modern recycling sector is unprecedented. With the Recycling Modernisation Fund of this government and the waste export bans which are coming into place sequentially over the course of this year and future years, we're talking about more than $600 million of co-investment, including those investments that have been delivered from the private sector, from the waste and recycling sectors, as I say, voting with their feet and their wallets to support the government's policies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So far, the Recycling Modernisation Fund has led to the announcement of 52 new recycling infrastructure projects, in the ACT, in Victoria, in New South Wales, in South Australia and in WA, to recycle our waste plastics, our glass, our tyres and our paper. Watch this space very soon, all honourable members, for announcements about more Recycling Modernisation Fund projects relating to Tasmania and Queensland. I wish I had more time to fill in the detail. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="248006" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BUTLER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  It's an absolute pleasure to be here with the minister to talk about a very important part of the budget, and that is water, a matter that he and I, as Queenslanders, very much enjoy engaging with. I think we'll both be speaking at the New South Wales local government Water Managers Conference in a couple of weeks. I'm sure that they'll all rub their Origin win in our faces; nonetheless, we'll continue to pursue it. One of the speeches to be made at that very important conference will be by distinguished Professor Lesley Hughes. I've seen a draft program and I believe she will be speaking to delegates about the risks to Australia of a three-degree Celsius warmer world. I know that the minister has some thoughts on climate change that he has been expressing recently. But I think that he would also acknowledge that climate change does pose a serious threat to water availability in the Murray-Darling Basin. Recently ANU Professor Mark Howden made the point that average river flows into the Murray-Darling Basin have dropped by 39 per cent over the past 20 years, and that is mostly due to climate change. In December last year the CSIRO told us that the hydroclimate of the Murray-Darling Basin is changing. CSIRO researchers said that the future would be warmer and is likely to be drier, with more severe droughts. A couple of years ago the government's own drought coordinator-general pointed out the risks of climate change to water availability, again also talking about the contribution of climate change to more frequent and more severe droughts. A range of people have spoken about this issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My question to the minister on this topic is: given this scientific evidence about the impact of climate change on reduced inflows into the basin—other people have observed it; the previous inspector-general of the Murray-Darling Basin observed lessening inflows into the basin—how is the minister ensuring that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is continuously underpinned by the most up-to-date science possible and takes into account climate change and the impacts of climate change on water availability in the basin? How does the minister intend to make sure that the plan does actually deal with these changing environmental conditions that arise as a consequence? Of course, this year has been a wet year. I think we have all been very, very relieved to see the rain, but we shouldn't only care about droughts in dry years. We should, as the saying might be adapted to go, in times of drought prepare for rain, and in times of rain prepare for drought. We do need to be focused on the possibility of droughts into the future and we also need to remember that drought is felt unevenly across the basin. For example, in our own home state of Queensland, they were still trucking water into Stanthorpe long after a lot of other places had been receiving water and were very wet. How will the government ensure that the continued changes to water availability and the continued reduction, it appears, in inflows will be accommodated? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the topic of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, I'd also like the minister to address the progress that's being made in respect of the supply measures that arose out of the SDL adjustment mechanism. What is the progress of those supply measures? What is the progress in terms of actually delivering those environmental outcomes equivalent to 605 gigalitres of water per year? What can the minister tell people in respect of whether those measures will be delivered on time? Are any of those supply measures being reviewed or reconsidered? Particularly, what is the status of the New South Wales measures, which, as the minister would know, the New South Wales government has previously said would not be able to be delivered?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also appreciate it if the minister would address the 450 gigalitres of water that was intended to be provided by efficiency measures. The minister is aware of the independent panel into the Water for the Environment Special Account report last year, which said that, of the 450 gigalitres per year, only 1.9 gigalitres had been delivered. That report said that the 450 gigalitres would not be delivered. How can the minister assure Australians living in the basin, as well as all Australians, that the 450 gigalitres will be delivered on time?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PITT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  I acknowledge my shadow counterpart, with whom we work well on this very important matter of water, particularly in the Murray-Darling Basin. Regarding the comments around Queensland and the State of Origin, we're a little bit embarrassed about the last score, but there are still two to go and I'm confident there'll be a recovery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In regard to the questions around the modelling and the information being used to inform the MDBA and Murray-Darling Basin communities, we have allocated significant funds in the budget to improve that modelling. That will help to build confidence in governments, water users and communities planning for the future. It is a significant investment, one which has been very much needed and which we have accounted for and provided for in the most recent budget announcements. There will be significant and substantial investment over coming years to update the modelling of the Murray-Darling Basin and how it is utilised right across the basin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In regard to other questions, I suggest that the shadow minister look at the most recent MINCO minutes and the decisions made and advice provided for an update on the status of projects and where we're up to. We've engaged someone to ensure that we have an overview of exactly the position of what is likely to have been done and finished by 2024, and where we're up to. Quite simply, we have significant funds left and a significant amount of time in which to perform what is necessary to meet the requirements of the plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In regard to questions around New South Wales measures, we're working very closely with New South Wales. Until last June, they hadn't submitted any of their water resource plans for surface water. We managed to get the groundwater plans put forward to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority for assessment, and they are currently being considered. They are complex and technical and they do take time—as did Victoria's, South Australia's and the ACT's plans—and we are working our way through that in a process which I'm sure the shadow minister will appreciate is difficult. It requires consultation and further toing and froing between us and New South Wales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In regard to the Menindee Lakes and Yanco projects—about which there have been considerable discussions, particularly in the media—at the most recent MINCO meeting there was an agreement with New South Wales that they would bring forward rescope projects for those two opportunities. They were to do that within a particular time frame. I look forward to New South Wales meeting that time frame and delivering on what they said they would.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In regard to the Off-Farm Efficiency Program, as I announced some weeks ago, we have shifted the Water Efficiency Program funding, or WEP, across to off-farm efficiencies. The advice I have is that we expect up to 150 gigalitres of recovery from doing that. We have at least 50 projects put forward already. We're working very closely with the states to ensure that we can get the best outcome with that funding for the projects themselves and the water that would be returned to the environment as part of the plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think I've addressed the questions that the shadow minister has put forward. I'd like to come back to the budget and the things that we are doing to continue to help those people who live in the Murray-Darling Basin, who work in agriculture and who rely on irrigated water. And not just irrigated water. I'm very pleased that the shadow minister acknowledged that we have had a much better season. There has been significant rainfall and storages are in a much better position than they had been previously. That is very positive and is being felt right across the community and the Murray-Darling Basin as a whole. We are continuing to provide practical advice and support. As the shadow minister said, it's a good time to work on drought infrastructure when it's raining and wet. We have put forward another $50 million for the On-farm Emergency Water Infrastructure Rebate Scheme. We have cleaned up what has been a mess of the states' making in terms of allowing overruns on that fund—funding which wasn't available. After, I have to say, a lot of toing and froing between ourselves and the states and territories, we have delivered another $50 million. So that's $100 million that is going towards that program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to call out the agriculture minister for New South Wales, who, I have to say, was more interested in playing politics than in actually delivering on this fund. We have delivered. It was the influence and the advocacy of people like the member for Calare, the member for Cowper, the member for New England and, of course, the member for Parkes, and others, who ensured that this money was made available to clean up what was literally an overrun of some thousands, in terms of the farmers across the country who made decisions for which they should have expected support. That support is now being provided by us. We continue to build confidence. We continue to build transparency. We continue to provide information to those communities across the Murray-Darling Basin, because that trust, that transparency and that confidence is critical to ensuring that we can continue to work with those communities and deliver what they expect from us.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  On the 150 gigalitres expected to be delivered by those off-farm infrastructure measures, it would be appreciated if the minister could provide a breakdown of where it is anticipated they will come from. The minister, I know, had some comments to make about the report that was jointly produced by the Conservation Council of South Australia and the Australia Institute recently. That report said that only three of the identified projects had specified water recovery amounts attached to them, so I think Australians would be very pleased to understand where the 150-gigalitre figure is coming from for off-farm efficiency processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also really appreciate the minister providing an update on the $40 million that was allocated for Aboriginal cultural water entitlements in the basin. That was part of the 2018 agreement that was reached in respect of a number of measures in the basin. I know the minister would be aware that there has been some growing criticism of the government in respect of the delay in the provision of those Aboriginal water entitlements. I think we'd benefit quite significantly from being able to hear from the minister on progress in respect of those Aboriginal water entitlements, because, of course, there are many important uses for water in the Murray-Darling Basin and cultural use is one of those really significant uses. With so many Aboriginal nations in the basin, I know that Australians would be very interested in this question.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn to the question of integrity and ethics in the basin. It has been a couple of years now since the Morrison government first announced that there would be an inspector-general of the Murray-Darling Basin. We had an interim one appointed. His appointment came and went. Then there was a lacuna. Then there was another interim one. He's still there. I am pleased to see that the government has brought forward the legislation to give a statutory underpinning for the role. I have a really simple question for the minister: given that that legislation can't commence on its own terms until all of the basin states have provided their approval for the amending provisions, can the minister update the parliament as to when he anticipates that legislation will commence?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, I'd like to ask the minister about a particular water buyback. The minister mentioned water buybacks yesterday in the parliament. Of course, Australia's most famous buybacks were two purchases of overland flow water licences from two properties, Kia Ora and Clyde, for an amount in the vicinity of $80 million. Those properties had been owned by a firm called Eastern Australia Agricultural Pty Ltd, the ultimate parent entity and ultimate controlling entity of which was Eastern Australia Irrigation Ltd, which was based in the Cayman Islands, a known tax haven. One of the founders of that company is someone who's now a minister in the Morrison government. Obviously, he has made clear that he no longer has an interest in that Cayman Island entity, but Australians, I think, are still interested in this particular buyback, particularly given the valuer, Colliers International, has informed the Australian National Audit Office that it does not consider the application of the premium referred to in their valuation report, to the range provided, to be reasonable.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister would also be aware of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> article, '$13m mistake: valuer says $80m water buyback price was not in line with its advice'. I understand that the department have said that they are now undertaking to review the material available to them at the time which supported their decision to pay that $80 million price. They were going to review that material and the basis for relying on those particular components of the valuer's report. The question, really, is: can the minister give us an update of the work that the department said they were going to do in reviewing the government's decision-making in respect of that $80 million buyback? There were two buybacks, but we can talk about them collectively, as one set of buybacks. Could the minister tell us whether the department has proceeded and what the progress has been?</span>
