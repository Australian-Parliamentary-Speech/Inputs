       I move that amendment today because this Government is engaging in an abuse of the Parliament unprecedented in the Commonwealth's history. In a profligate waste of tens of thousands of the taxpayers' dollars this Government has recalled the House during the recess, while trying to evade the scrutiny of the House in session and suppressing Question Time and the discussion of matters of public importance. Now, interestingly enough, the Government is scurrying out of the Senate, leaving in limbo at least 18 Bills, 16 of which it has classified as essential. Not only do those opposite mismanage the Government and the Parliament and have to get us to come back, but 18 pieces of legislation, 16 of which they had classified as essential, will not even go through the Parliament. You will need to do more than what you are doing now.

        —I think it is fair to say that this Government, comprising small and diminished men, attempts to use the House of Representatives of the people of Australia as if it were an adjunct of the Enmore branch of the Australian Labor Party. There is no doubt that this Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is trying to apply to this Parliament the lessons in political control that he has learned by attending the right wing factions of his own Party and the lessons handed down to him, seemingly, by his new tutor, the present Treasurer (Mr Keating), who is, after all, the man who presided over the New South Wales ALP in its most tarnished hours. The Treasurer is so totally seized of his Prime Minister's decisiveness that the story doing the rounds of the ALP in this building is that he calls his Prime Minister 'jellyback'-presumably, with all the Treasurer's normal expletives deleted.

       Today, respect for the forms of the House requires the amendment of the motion before the Chair so that the House can proceed with its Question Time and with its debate on a matter of public importance. Today, form is not the only matter at stake. Today, form follows substance. Today, the substance is the Government's accountability to the House of Representatives. Since this House rose a week ago, we have had a further decline in the dollar, the announcement of the capital gains taxing, the fiddles with the assets test and numerous other elements that deserve to be discussed.
      </para>
      <para>
       On only two previous occasions in the nation's history has the Parliament been recalled for a sitting such as this on a day other than that specified in the special adjournment motion. The first was in 1940 in the dark days of military threat to this country, when the Parliament was recalled to consider Australia's national security; and the second was in 1975 when the financial scandals surrounding the Whitlam Government forced it to try to account to the nation. Now we know that it is being written that there is a whiff of Whitlam in the air. That is the only way that one could equate the recalling of this Parliament with that loan scandal. The Whitlam Government's attempt to arrest its political haemorrhaging was futile and so too will be the nonsense that is being carried out here today.
      </para>
      <para>
       This session was called today because the Government failed to consult with the veterans organisations before changing the entitlements of Australia's own veterans. Because of this breach of trust, the Senate amended the Government's legislation to impose a six months sunset clause to compel the Government belatedly to meet its promise to consult with the veterans associations. So the Government, as a consequence of its breach of promise, has recalled the House.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have indicated the sorts of issues that ought to be dealt with, the sorts of matters that have arisen since the House of Representatives adjourned. First of all, within about 36 hours of the House rising, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) introduced administrative changes to the assets test. He would not indicate to this Parliament that the old inequities which made the assets test a national disgrace are left unchanged and he would not indicate that the assets test itself is an anomaly, inherently unjust, unfair, discriminatory against one section of the community, and for that reason will be abolished by us-not amended, not tinkered with, not fiddled with behind the scenes to continue the inequities.
      </para>
      <para>
       Why did the Government skulk away and leave it until the weekend after the House rose to announce those administrative changes? It is because it was not prepared to defend them in this Parliament. The Government is not prepared to answer questions on the assets test today because it knows what the assets test has cost and what it ought to have cost because of its unfairness. In the last two days we have learned about the capital gains tax. During the election campaign I went around the country saying, 'As certain as night follows day you will get a capital gains tax' and the people of Australia are getting it. They now know that, as certain as an express train coming at them, the Government will dump a capital gains tax on them. Why will the Government not discuss it with us today? Why will it not give us time to ask the Treasurer why he has got death duties as well as this capital gains tax in the present proposal? That is the present proposal. The Government knows that the demands for a capital gains tax are by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, by the Left, and by the Centre Left; they want death duties and gift duties. The Government is wrapping them up in the proposal that the Treasurer's office, with some extraordinary degree of political sagacity, leaked to the newspapers for publication yesterday. This is only the start of the matters that ought to be discussed.
      </para>
      <para>
       What about the continuing decline of the dollar? The decline has been brought about by the assessments made of the international community of old jellyback's economic policies. If jellyback has not got the spine to come in here today and defend his Government we at least have got the guts to stand up and say to the people of Australia: 'These matters have to be discussed'. I do not know why the Treasurer referred to him as jellyback in regard to the performance of the Parliament to date; I would have chosen worse terminology, but I would like to hear from the Treasurer why he did so. Was it the twists and turns on tertiary fees? Was it the twists and turns on taxation? I do not know. The House is entitled to an explanation of the obvious deep-seated division in the ranks of the Government between the Treasurer and the Prime Minister.

        —Mr Speaker, I second the amendment. There is another reason, in addition to those listed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock), why we are being denied Question Time today. It is to be found on the front page of the Australian Financial Review. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has been busy leaking against his Treasurer (Mr Keating). That is what has been happening. He does not like the fact that over the last few weeks the Treasurer has been getting some good headlines. I know what goes on in that corner office when Treasurers start getting good headlines. I can tell honourable members that. I have not the slightest doubt that those minder mates of the Prime Minister have come in and said: 'Hey, Bob, this is getting a bit out of hand'. After all, the Treasurer is supposed to be the Prime Minister's supporter; he is not supposed to be the Prime Minister's guider or leader. The Prime Minister cannot tolerate a situation where every day he is muttering out of the side of his mouth: 'I do not know whether he is in or out of the cart. I do not know whether he is with me or against me on taxation reform'. His minders are, no doubt, saying to him: 'Look, you used to be Mr 74 per cent. The only way you are going to get back to anything like it is for you to put this down. You cannot have people running around saying that the Treasurer is leading you by the nose. I will tell you what you have got to do. You have got to go to the members of the Press and tell them how tough you were in dealing with the Premiers. That is what you have got to do. You have got to say that you went in there, lined them up and said: ''I will have none of this Treasury weakness. I am going to demand that we go to the Premiers Conference with a really tough line on the States. We are really going to hold them back. We are really going to screw them down. We are really going to demontrate how strong we are. In the process we are going to tell them all that Bob did it; that if it had not been for the strength displayed by the Prime Minister over his permissive Treasurer, this tough line would not have been taken''.

       The reality is that we saw in this morning's Press the clearest possible evidence that this Prime Minister is taking a lunge at the person who has been the closest ally in his Government. Everybody knows that when open conflict develops between Prime Ministers and Treasurers in government, those governments are in very big trouble.

        —That is right. As far as I am concerned, this is the best possible example that we have had in a long time of this occurring. We have seen on the front page of the Australian Financial Review a very dramatic illustration of this Prime Minister's craven populism, his frantic inability to accept a reduction in his personal popularity. It is an illustration that he is lurching from one poll which reduces his popularity and his esteem to another. He cannot stand the credit and the publicity that his Treasurer gets for the courage that he is displaying in pushing ahead on matters related to good taxation reform. What does the Prime Minister do? He resorts to the cheap device of going to the front page of the Australian Financial Review, beating his chest and saying: 'Wasn't I tough, wasn't I clever? The Treasurer wanted to be weak but I was prepared to be strong. I was prepared to take those Premiers on. I was prepared to tell them what their duty was and the Treasurer was not prepared to do that.' I think that is the clearest sign yet of how nervous this Prime Minister is about his devalued authority. We hear talk about the devaluation of our dollar. The devalued authority of the Prime Minister, of his leadership, his esteem and his respect, have really been brought home today when he has resorted to the cheap and demeaning device of deliberately leaking a story that is meant to be damaging to the man who has given him more respectability and more support within his own Government than any other member of that Government.

        —The Government will not agree to the Opposition's amendment. We are somewhat persuaded in our opinion by the Opposition's lack of performance at Question Time over the last three months. It has been unable to fill out 45 minutes of Question Time for the last three months; so it is showing a fair bit of audacity to ask for an hour today. In fact, a quick check of the records shows that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the National Party (Mr Sinclair) have asked 45 per cent of all the questions that have come from the other side. They have not made one dint on the Government in the three months in which this House has been sitting.

       I would have thought that the most positive way this Parliament might have exercised its voice today would have been to congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) for the work they did yesterday on behalf of all the people of Australia. That was not something that the honourable member for Bennelong-the $9.6 billion man-was able to achieve during his term as Treasurer because of the malice of Mal. It is not the whiff of Whitlam that we are worried about; it is the perfume of the colt from Kooyong. That is what we on the front bench of this side of the House cannot get over.

       We are here today because the Senate has amended a piece of essential legislation which was part of the Government's economic statement. We are here because of actions that were taken by the Opposition, not actions that were taken by the Government. We are here to deal with the matter that has been presented to the Parliament. Nothing the Opposition has said in the last three months has influenced the way in which this Government is determining to make decisions on behalf of all Australians. One of the great benefits of bringing the House together is that we are able to put on notice and put on display this feeble Opposition. Every time Opposition members are on display it becomes automatic that our term in office will be prolonged. Every time people are able to witness the inadequacy of the Opposition it is of advantage to us. The Opposition wants an hour for Question Time. What a joke! Any observer of Parliament who looks at Question Time over the last three months will see that the Opposition has not made any dint at all in the Government. It is absolutely ludicrous. As I have said, we shall deal with the business that we have come here to deal with. I move:

        asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 22 February 1985:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Has his attention been drawn to estimates by criminologist Mr Allen Perry in The Advertiser of 21 May 1984, that computer crime is costing Australia $500 million a year, but that only 1 per cent or 2 per cent of computer crimes are ever detected, and even then not all crimes are reported to police or prosecuted.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Has his attention also been drawn to an article in Future Age of 7 May 1984, which claimed that the consensus of Australian law and crime experts is that Australian authorities are yet to find out what is actually going on with computer crime and even if they did know, there is a feeling they would not be able to tackle it effectively.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Is he able to say whether the Victorian Attorney-General is planning to legislate against computer-related crimes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Is it a fact, as claimed by Francine McNiff in the Future Age article referred to in part (2), that the jurisdiction of State criminal courts is territorial, in that each State can determine only those offences occurring within its own geographical limits, whereas with computer crime and abuse, state and national boundaries are almost non-existent, as the user of a computer in Tasmania could quite feasibly perpetrate an abuse on a computer in Darwin, Brisbane or even Hong Kong.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Are there conceptual difficulties in drafting legislation to deal with computer-related crime, as claimed by the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions, including the problems of identification, in terms of legal concept, of property that can be the subject of an offence allied to theft and the facilitating of methods of proving an offence in a court so that the very sophisticated concepts involved in computers can be understood by a lay tribunal.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) Has his attention been drawn to reported comments of Chief Inspector Brown of the Victorian Fraud Squad that the only remedies available for computer crimes in which the computer is a target, rather than just a tool, are 'Band-Aid prosecutions', such as charging an offender with theft of the piece of paper on which he had printed the information from a computer file rather than with the theft of the information itself; if so can this be substantiated.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Does he have evidence to substantiate that a national solution to computer crime and an innovative approach to computer law, is needed; if so, will he urgently consider my repeated requests for a reference to the Australian Law Reform Commission on crime committed through or in connection with the use of computers.

      <para>
       As stated in answer to Question No. 1356 (Hansard, 4 September 1984, page 435) the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General has this matter under active consideration. Ministers have agreed that uniform legislation is necessary in view of the transborder nature of this criminal activity. There are novel and difficult problems associated with the preparation of legislation to deal with computer-related crimes. I am confident that the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General will be able to agree on effective model legislation for enactment by all jurisdictions in Australia. As the Standing Committee is giving this matter attention I reiterate my previous advice that it would not be appropriate at this time to refer the matter to the Australian Law Reform Commission.

      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Is it a fact that parties to a takeover litigation may have to wait for more than 6 months for the final resolution of a dispute by the High Court.

      <para>
       (3) Will he initiate urgent discussions within the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities with a view to setting up an expert tribunal to deal effectively and expeditiously with all disputes arising under the Takeovers Code.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Is it a fact that, because of the lengthy delays involved, an appellate court might find it impracticable to grant the relief sought by a plaintiff in takeover litigation even though the plaintiff's legal arguments are accepted.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Can he say whether parties to takover litigation with very meritorious cases have been forced to abandon appeals from dubious single judge decisions because delays within the appellate court system appear to make it extraordinarily difficult for an appellate court to satisfactorily unscramble a takeover.

       (1) to (5) In the light of concerns such as those expressed by the honourable member, the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities has referred to the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee for inquiry and review the questions of:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) the appropriateness of the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act 1980 as a mechanism for regulating takeovers in Australia; and
      </para>

       (b) the appropriateness of existing mechanisms for review of decisions of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC), and any related matters.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee has given high priority to the reference on takeovers. Its review of this matter is still in progress. In view of the wide range of matters referred to it, the Committee has not yet begun work on the reference on appeals under co-operative companies and securities legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not wish to pre-empt the review on the above matters being undertaken by the Committee. However, I note that views similar to those of the honourable member and my predecessor have been expressed by Mr Jim Bain, Chairman of the Stock Exchange of Sydney, and Mr Leigh Masel, when Chairman of the NCSC. The new chairman of the NCSC, Mr Henry Bosch, is very concerned to ensure that business regulation is kept as simple as possible and that disputes arising as part of takeovers are handled speedily and expertly.
      </para>
      <para>
       The proposal of an expert tribunal may provide a suitable mechanism in that regard. In the meantime, the matter is with the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee. The Ministerial Council as a whole will consider the Committee's views as soon as they are available.

       1. Australia has succeeeded to a number of treaties relating to extradition negotiated by Great Britain which may be referred to as 'inherited' treaties.

       5. 'Inherited' treaties are substantially similar in their terms and the effectiveness of many of them has been demonstrated when Australia has acceded to requests, or has itself made requests, for extradition pursuant to these treaties. Nevertheless the Extradition Task Force has identified some areas common to many inherited treaties that are archaic and approaches have been made to several countries to replace these treaties with modern treaties. All countries thus far approached have responded favourably.

       6. Australia does not have extradition arrangements with a number of countries for a variety of reasons. In relation to some countries, it is considered inappropriate for political reasons to negotiate extradition treaties. The system of justice in some countries differs so markedly from the Australian system that there is no reasonable basis for negotiation. Some countries have indicated that they can give no priority to concluding extradition arrangements, which are likely to be seldom used.

Since 5 March 1983 a draft extradition treaty between Ireland and Australia has been under consideration. During this period a draft model treaty which is to be used as the basis for future extradition treaty negotiations has been settled and in the context of a need for uniformity in extradition arrangements, negotiations with Ireland have now, as their basis, the draft model treaty.

       (1) The Department uses either commercial production houses, including the services of Film Australia, or its own in-house video production facilities. In commercial cases a ''Registration of Interest'' process has been arranged through the Department of Local Government and Administrative Services.

       (1) The Australian Bicentennial Road Development (ABRD) Trust Fund Act does not specify a formal allocation of moneys among States and/or road categories in respect of any particular year of the ABRD Program.

       Figures are published annually in association with the Federal Budget setting out an indicative allocation among States and categories of revenues estimated to be paid into the Trust Fund during the particular year. However, it should be noted that these allocations do not provide the sole basis for the distribution of payments from the Trust Fund in any particular year. The amounts paid from the Trust Fund also take account of the differing rates of progress achieved on construction works in respective States and categories during the year.

      <para>
       (1) Recent radio interference involving the Dural FM repeater station resulted mainly from the activities of one person. Since my Department took regulatory action against him on 10 January 1985, there has been only one official complaint of interference concerning the repeater station, which occurred on 12 March 1985.

       (2) In September 1984 there were a number of prosecutions pending in relation to misuse of the Dural repeater station, which mainly involved the one person. While a number of prosecutions have already led to convictions, there are others which have yet to be dealt with by the Court.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) My Department possesses a variety of electronic equipment which is used by field staff in the normal course of their duties to detect and locate sources of radio interference. Included among this equipment are some recently purchased items which are used solely for direction finding of radiocommunication transmitting stations. As considerable skill is required to use these devices the Department has provided field staff with special training in their operation.

      <para>
       Australia co-sponsored United Nations General Assembly resolution 39/72G (1984). It did so as an expression of the abhorrence of apartheid felt by the Australian Government and people. The resolution requested states to consider taking various steps in their relations with South Africa. The Government has given careful and sympathetic consideration to the proposals in the resolution and has concluded that Government action accords clearly and closely with the thrust of the resolution, as shown by the following information.
      </para>
      <para>
       Operative paragraph 7 of resolution 39/72G:
      </para>
      <para>
       7 (a) The Government makes no investments in or loans to South Africa. Pending the imposition of mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa by the United Nations Security Council, which the Government is prepared to support and, if adopted, to implement, the Government will request Australian companies operating in South Africa to abide by the voluntary code of conduct, the terms of which I announced in the House of Representatives on 18 April.
      </para>
      <para>
       7 (b) All Government promotion of trade with South Africa has ceased.
      </para>
      <para>
       7 (c) Australia conducts no military or intelligence co-operation with South Africa. In the interests of law enforcement in Australia occasional contact is maintained between the law enforcement authorities.

      <para>
       7 (d) There is no nuclear collaboration between Australia and South Africa.
      </para>
      <para>
       Operative paragraph 8 of resolution 39/72G:
      </para>
      <para>
       8 (a) Australia contributes to various multilateral funds designed to provide educational and training assistance for Namibian and South African students.
      </para>
      <para>
       Some of the recipient bodies are solely concerned with Namibia while others have wider objectives and interests but include Namibians in their programs. Australia has pledged $A220,000 in 1985 to a number of United Nations funds for southern Africa, which include the United Nations Education and Training Program for Southern Africa (UNETPSA) and the United Nations Fund for Namibia (UNFN). Since 1978 Namibians have been awarded scholarships under the auspices of the Commonwealth of Nations to study in Australia. There are five students currently studying in Australia. A Namibian participated in the Foreign Service Training Course of the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1984.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia's membership of the UN Council for Namibia is an indication of the Government's concern over the territory and its people.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia provides educational assistance (scholarships) to South Africans disadvantaged by apartheid to pursue tertiary and other studies in South Africa.
      </para>
      <para>
       8 (b) On 26 October 1983 the Government announced that it was prepared to see the establishment in Australia of information offices for the South West African People's Organisation (SWAPO) and the African National Congress (ANC). The ANC established an information office in Australia in December 1983 and a SWAPO representative arrived in Australia on 25 March 1985 to do the same. Australia does not provide direct support to African liberation movements.
      </para>
      <para>
       8 (c) The Australian Government supports the efforts of the Front Line States and the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) to promote and strengthen regional and national economic development to reduce dependence on South Africa. Australia provides bilateral and multilateral assistance to the Front Line States mostly in terms of food aid. While the Government is not currently considering an increase in allocation of aid to SADCC and the Front Line States, it is developing a program of long term aid to Africa which is intended to focus on food security. The Australian Government was also active in the recent International Development Agency (IDA) negotiations and was one of the first countries to offer a contribution additional to its previous proportional level.
      </para>
      <para>
       Operative paragraph 9 of resolution 39/72G:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Government does not provide assistance to South Africa in academic, cultural or sporting fields: neither does it encourage the development of relations in these areas. In keeping with its rejection of apartheid, the Government has a strong policy of discouraging all forms of representative sporting contact between Australia and South Africa. In 1983 the Government established a program whereby prominent opponents of apartheid are invited to Australia as guests-of-government. Bishop Desmond Tutu and Dr Alan Boesak, both prominent opponents of the South African Government, have visited Australia under this program. As mentioned under 8 (a) above the Government has established a scholarship program for black South Africans disadvantaged by apartheid.

      <para>
       Section 18 (1) of the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983 requires that AN conduct its operations '. . . in a manner that accords with sound commercial practice'. To meet this statutory requirement the Commission compares the changes in revenue and the changes in expenditure which would occur from service changes or cessations. Decisions are taken based on the results of these financial analyses, supplemented by information of the effects of changes on AN staff and on those communities which would be affected by service reductions.

       The provisions of the railway transfer agreements between the Commonwealth and South Australia and Tasmania must also be taken into account. These agreements require, in certain circumstances, the approval of Commonwealth and State Ministers for Transport before changes can occur.

      <para>
       (1) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the many 1985 edition of Pacific Defence Reporter entitled 'Australia's Vulnerable Sea Lines' particularly that part of the article which states that it appeared from material available either that Defence strategy does not recognise the importance of the defence of overseas trade, or that the defence of overseas trade had been placed in the 'too hard basket', and that the Government in arriving at its decision on the submarine short list should not opt for cheap and unproven designs offered by companies with little or no blue-water experience.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Is it a fact that neutral flags are no protection for merchant shipping in times of hostilities between other nations or groups of nations.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Does Australia depend largely on there being free movement of maritime trade, both import and export, in order to sustain its agricultural, transport, mining and manufacturing industries.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Can he assure those individuals or organisations in the Australian community looking to him as their principal ministerial decision maker that he will take an active role in Cabinet discussions on the choice of a new submarine design for the RAN, given the requirement that will be placed on these vessels to ensure that Australian sea lines of communication remain open.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) An agency agreement covering the total operation and control of the ACT railway was signed by AN and the SRA on 5 May 1985 for a period of 25 years or such shorter period as may result from its termination by an Act of the Commonwealth Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The 'nominal' rental is a licence fee of $1.00 per annum payable by the SRA to AN.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Commonwealth bears no costs for recurrent maintenance or capital expenditure after the commencement date of 5 May 1985.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Based on operating losses since 1982-83 AN expects to save in excess of $0.5 million per annum as a result of the agreement.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Prior to the SRA taking over total operations of the ACT Railway, freight rates between NSW stations and Canberra were charged at intersystem railways of Australia rates. These provide for terminal charges at both points of origin and destination as well as a line haul charge. Following the agreement, the SRA has adopted its own internal basis of charging which has produced lower rates.
      </para>
      <para>
       Rail passenger fares prior to the takeover by the SRA comprised an SRA component based on a distance formula and an AN component. After the takeover, the AN component was removed. As the Sydney-Canberra distance falls within the same distance formula range as Sydney-Queanbeyan, the SRA component remained the same thus producing a fare decrease. Passenger fares and freight rates between Sydney and Canberra are now a matter solely for the SRA to determine.
      </para>
      <para>
       The agreement between the SRA and AN also provides, in general, that fares, freight rates and services to and from Canberra shall be maintained after the transfer at levels not less favourable than those which apply to users of the remainder of the SRA's network.

      <para>
       (1) The Attorney-General's Department received advice from the Australian Federal Police on Tuesday, 23 October 1984 that a person thought to be Robert Trimbole was suspected of being in Ireland. That information became more definite later that day and was confirmed late on Wednesday, 24 October 1984.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Negotiations between officials for an extradition treaty with Ireland took place in Dublin in June 1972. Follow up correspondence continued intermittently until 1977 without finality. Thereafter until mid-1983, the matter was substantially inactive. In January 1982 the Irish Treaty File was put away into the Department's Registry and was not retrieved until July 1983. In mid-1983 work commenced on the settling of a model extradition treaty incorporating the latest developments in international extradition law. The model treaty was to be the basis for negotiations with countries with which extradition arrangements did not then exist. By October 1984 the model treaty had been substantially settled between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General's Department. On 3 October 1984 Professor Ivan Shearer of the University of New South Wales, a recognised expert in extradition law, was asked to comment on the model treaty. As at 23 October 1984 the work before 1977 on the Irish Treaty had been overtaken by the development of the model treaty. The negotiation of a modern Extradition Treaty with Ireland has been taking place and is at an advanced stage.
      </para>
      <para>
       On confirmation of Robert Trimbole's being in Ireland, Australia moved immediately to negotiate and put in place extradition arrangements with Ireland pursuant to sub-section 10(4) of the Extradition (Foreign States) Act 1966. Those arrangements were subsequently upheld by the High Court of Australia and the High Court of Ireland.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The tariff does not apply to all imported grain harvesters as the Government decided that tariff concessions would apply to very large machines not produced locally. Specific data for the wheat industry on the annual user cost of the 15 per cent tariff applying to imports of grain harvesters is not available. For the grains and oilseeds industries the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) estimated the user cost to be of the order of $11m per annum. The IAC based its estimate (contained in its Report no. 320 'Grain Harvesters' of 18 May 1983) on 1982 levels of imports and local production. This is the latest estimate available. The total user cost to the wheat industry would, of course, be less.
      </para>
      <para>
       The IAC also estimated that, in aggregate, the 15 per cent tariff on imported harvesters increased the materials input costs of the graingrowing industry as a whole by approximately 1 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The industry currently employs about 670 people. Their share in the benefits from the tariff assistance would be equivalent to a value of up to about $16,500 per annum, depending on the extent to which shareholders and those not directly employed in the industry also benefit. The extent to which this represents a net transfer of income from grain producers (including their employees and suppliers) is dependent on the level of benefits which they also derive from Government assistance to grain producers and rural industries generally, as well as judgment as to the level that prices, and repair and maintenance costs, would be in the absence of any local manufacturing capability.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) It is technically feasible to provide assistance for local production of grain harvesters by way of a bounty. This would directly amount to about $1.3m per annum according to the IAC's estimate, but this excludes the revenue foregone from the abolition of the tariff which was estimated at $7.6m in 1983-84 and also excludes the costs of administering the bounty.

       (1) The Government does not intend introducing a subsidy to reduce the impact of its crude oil import parity pricing policy.

      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Government's sound approach to economic management has benefited the rural sector in several ways. In particular, through the sucess of our approach to budgetary restraint and the prices and Incomes Accord, inflation has fallen from 11.5 per cent in 1982/83 to around 5 per cent; the rate of growth in farm costs has fallen to an estimed 6 per cent in 1984/85, less than half the average rate of growth over the previous 6 years; and industrial disputation has also substantially declined.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The most important immediate effect on the rural sector of the recent devaluation of the Australian dollar has been significantly increased returns for Australian exporters of commodities priced in currencies which have appreciated against our dollar. The National Farmers' Federation strongly supports the Government's decision to float the dollar.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The latest figure of 5.6 per cent as at 31 March 1985.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) 2.5 per cent of total funding under the Community Employment Program (CEP) approved in Queensland in 1984-85 has been in the Woodridge Commonwealth Employment Serice area.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The level of CEP funding approved in any area is largely dependent upon local sponsors putting forward wothwhile projects which meet the guidelines, objectives and priorities of the Program. Every effort has already been made by both Commonwealth and State field staff to assist potential sponsors in the Woodridge area in the development of CEP proposals. In addition, the CEP State Consultative Committee attempts to ensure an equitable distribution of CEP funds on the basis of regional levels of unemployment.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since the commencement of the CEP in Queensland, 37 projects creating 343 jobs and involving CEP funding of $3,387,569 have been approved in the Woodridge CES area. In 1984-85, CEP funding of $1,091,626 for 11 projects creating 116 jobs has already been approved.
      </para>
      <para>
       I understand that a further package of project proposals will be presented to the Consultative Committee for consideration on 7 June 1985 which may provide additional CEP funds in the Woodridge area.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Aboriginal Development Commission  1  Department of Aboriginal Affairs 13 TOTAL  14
      </para>
      <para>
       This number includes American Express, Diners Club and Bankcard.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Department of Finance through the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has provided the following advice with respect to Parts 2-5 of the question:
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Credit Cards available to officers are issued by American Express International (Amex), Diners Club International, The Australian Telecommunications Commission (Telecom), The Australian National Airlines Commission (TAA), Ansett Airlines of Australia Ltd (Ansett).
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) There are normally no membership or service fees applicable to TAA, Ansett or Telecom credit cards. In respect of Amex and Diners Club credit cards, a departmental secretary may approve reimbursement of the annual membership fee to an officer in accordance with Finance Direction 34/25. Amex and Diners Club have introduced special annual membership rates for officers who apply for and are issued with credit cards through 'Corporate Card' Schemes that were negotiated with the Department of Finance-usually of the order of $10-12.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The issue of TAA, Ansett and Telecom credit cards to nominated senior officers, e.g. departmental secretaries and their deputies has been longstanding. There are no restrictions on the level of officers who may apply for Amex or Diners Club credit cards. However, before a credit card is issued under the 'Corporate Card' Scheme, a department must be satisfied that an officer has a 'work-related' need for the card.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) TAA, Ansett and Telecom credit cards are intended for use by senior officers where there is an urgent need to use the services of those bodies for official purposes in circumstances that do not allow the usual procedures to be followed, such as outside normal business hours or in locations remote from the department's office.
      </para>
      <para>
       Amex and Diners Club cards are subject to the limitations placed on the cards by Amex or Diners Club. Officers are responsible to meet all expenditure charged to their card account. Expenditure of an official nature incurred by the use of credit cards is subject to normal reimbursement procedures to which the disciplines of the Audit Act and other relevant legislation are applied. Other charges including interest etc that the officer chooses to incur in using these cards are the personal responsibility of that officer.

       The Government has consistently taken the view that all such claims should be processed through the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in accordance with the National Wage Fixation Principles.

      <para>
       In the case of the Melbourne Cricket Ground site allowance, the parties privately agreed on a site allowance amounting to an extra $83.65 per week, despite the decision of 25 February 1985 by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission which found that an allowance of that magnitude could not be justified.
      </para>
      <para>
       The matter was heard again before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on 24 April 1985 and the Government appeared as an intervener at those proceedings. The Government submitted that the process by which the allowance was agreed to at the MCG was clearly outside the terms of the Wage Fixation Principles, was contrary to the site allowance procedures specified in the relevant awards, was contrary to the terms of the Building Industry Agreement, and was clearly prejudicial to the Government's wages policy which requires an orderly and responsible approach in dealing with claims of such a nature.

      <para>
       (1) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The campaign involves ship repair unions demanding certain repairs on foreign flag vessels prior to their departure and maritime unions delaying departure until that work is carried out.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) I am aware of 34 vessels which have berthed in Sydney over the past 12 months which have had demands placed on them for certain repair work to be undertaken.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The cost of the repair work undertaken on those vessels is estimated to be in the vicinity of $1.3m. That figure may in some instances also include the cost of repairs relating to ship safety required by Department of Transport Marine Surveyors. The cost of repairs has been met by shipowners.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The Government is not aware of any plans by shippers to increase the cost of shipping as a result of the unions' campaign.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The Government neither approves nor condones the use of intimidating tactics by any group in our society, including trade unions. I am aware that there exist certain unsubstantiated allegations that the campaign by ship repair unions involves threats of extortion. The Government is of the view that allegations of this nature should be pursued with the relevant law enforcement agency.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Separate discussions have recently been held with both the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Chamber of Shipping concerning this issue. Those discussions have resulted in a number of positive initiatives which are currently being further developed. Such initiatives should lead to a minimisation of industrial action of this nature. Further discussions on this issue will be held with the parties in the near future.
      </para>
      <para>
       On the wider front the Government is extremely concerned at the problems presently affecting the ship repair industry and in that context has taken a number of steps aimed at overcoming those problems. Specific Government initiatives affecting the industry will be determined in consultation with the industry and in the light of the report of the tripartite Working Party established at last year's Quadripartite Ship Repair Industry meeting to develop options for the industry. The Government believes that it is essential for all parties to take a positive approach if we are to address the problems of the ship repair industry.

      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The primary reason for the imbalance between the CYSS funds allocated to Queensland and Tasmania is the practice adopted by the former Government, from the Scheme's inception, of allocating funds on the basis of submissions received and without particular attention to the need for an equitable spread based on the distribution of youth unemployment.
      </para>
      <para>
       An additional factor that has contributed to the disparities in funding between the two States is the comparatively large number of small CYSS projects established in Tasmania to serve relatively isolated communities.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The Government is aware that, historically, both Queensland and New South Wales have been relatively disadvantaged in respect of the availability of CYSS services, but it does not propose to redress the imbalance by decreasing the current funding to CYSS projects in Tasmania or to those in other States or Territories. It has, however, been possible to move in a limited way towards reducing inequities between States, by allocating funds set aside over the last two years for new projects, upgrading existing projects and special initiative grants, on the basis of each State's share of youth unemployment.
      </para>
      <para>
       The future distribution of CYSS funds between the States is receiving detailed consideration in the context of the current consultations concerning the Kirby Committee's recommendations including the possible establishment of an Australian Youth Service. Subject, of course, to the outcome of those consultations, both Queensland and New South Wales will be given priority in the allocation of any funds subsequently provided for new projects and for upgrading existing projects. By this means, and over time we will be able to achieve substantially greater equity in the allocation of CYSS funds.

       Is it a fact that for eligibility for family income supplement the gross family income must be not more than $219 per week; if so, how does this cater for a small business or farming family whose gross income exceeds this figure but which is exceeded by its cost, thus creating a negative income to support the family.

       Family income supplement (FIS) is an income tested non-taxable allowance of up to $14 a week for each child under 16 or dependent full-time student aged 16-24 inclusive.
      </para>
      <para>
       The maximum rate of FIS is payable only where parental income does not exceed a prescribed limit which is currently $223 a week. This limit is increased each May and November in line with CPI changes. Where parental income exceeds the prescribed limit, the maximum rate is reduced by one half of the excess income. Thus, the level of income at which FIS ceases to be payable is higher than the prescribed limit by $28 a week for each child.

      <para>
       Income is defined in the Social Security Act as ' . . . personal earnings, moneys, valuable consideration or profits earned, derived or received by that person for his own use or benefit by any means from any source . . .'. In assessing income of a business, allowance is made for costs incurred in running the business.

      <para>
       (1) It is the Federal Government's objective to achieve a minimum four-lane standard on the Sydney-Melbourne National Highway by 1988, the Bicentennial year. Accordingly, I have advised my State counterparts in New South Wales and Victoria that this is the Federal Government's first priority for the National Highway network. Achievement of this objective will depend on a number of factors, the most important being movements in construction costs, the speedy resolution of possible environmental problems, and design and engineering capacity constraints.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Completion to dual carriageway standard throughout the entire length of the Sydney-Melbourne National Highway will not be undertaken until it can be justified on the basis of traffic volumes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The rate of progress in New South Wales and Victoria has been similar in terms of length of new dual carriageway constructed to date. As at December 1984, the length of dual carriageway in Victoria was 160 km and in New South Wales 159 km. As the section of the National Highway in Victoria is considerably shorter than that in New South Wales, Victoria has less dual carriageway work to finish. Considerable progress has been achieved in New South Wales, despite rugged terrain with its consequent implications for both speed and cost of construction.

      <para>
       (1) The Papua New Guinea Government has announced the imposition of bans on the import of certain canned meat products as part of an agreement reached with James Barnes Pty Ltd for that company to establish a meat cannery in Madang. The bans on canned meat products have not yet been applied, but are planned to come into effect from the start-up date of the cannery, scheduled for June 1986, as follows

       - from June 1986 for 8 years, to apply to corned mutton and corned beef

      </para>
      <para>
       Prior to implementation of the import bans, import quotas will be imposed on individual importers based on performance by the importers during the 1983 year. Quotas will be phased in, commencing as soon as administrative arrangements can be finalised and reducing by 25-50 per cent depending on product for the 6 month period immediately before the ban takes effect on the respective product.

       (3) The primary responsibility for identifying export marketing opportunities for meat and livestock, including canned meat products, and for developing industry marketing strategies rests with the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC). I have written to the Chairman of the AMLC advising him of my concern and suggesting that the AMLC should investigate alternate market prospects. The AMLC is about to commence operations under its first approved corporate plan with the emphasis on the marketing of meat and meat products in Australia and overseas. I have also drawn the attention of the AMLC to the trade facilitation activities of the Department of Trade, who have offered full support for marketing initiatives.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The first year that the statistics sought by the honourable member were kept by the Export Development Grants Board was for the 1982-83 Grant Year on EMDG claims determined during FY 1983-84. These statistics are shown in the latest (9th) Annual Report of the Export Development Grants Board for the year 1983-84.
      </para>
      <para>
       That report shows that there were total EMD grants determined for all industry categories of $83.95 million for the 1982-83 Grant Year, and the value of grants to primary industry were recorded as-
      </para>
      <para>
       Unprocessed primary products-agricultural and pastoral (6.4 of total grants determined)  $5.37m Processed primary products-agricultural and pastoral (15.3 of total grants determined)  $12.84m Other processed primary products (1.1 of total grants determined)  $0.92m  Total  $19.13m (approximately 22.8 per cent of total grants determined)
      </para>
      <para>
       It should be noted that the total grants determined of $83.95m for Grant Year 1982-83, shown in the 9th Annual Report covered 3325 claims, which were only a little more than half of the total 6535 claims registered for 1982-83 for assessment. Moreover some EMDG claimants export mixed eligible goods and services and in these cases it is not possible to differentiate between what proportion of the grant determined was attributable to primary products exports.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The appendices to the EDGB Annual Report include details of the amount of grant paid to each individual claimant. There is, however, no classification or break-up which allows determination of whether the claimant fell into the primary industry category.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Under the current administrative procedures the States are not required to supply the Federal Government with the detailed contract information sought. The States are required to provide statistics on tenders received and contracts awarded for road works to private contractors, State Government Authorities and Local Government Authorities by road category and contract value on a yearly basis. This information is available in the ABRD Annual Report (ref. Appendix 7, 1983/84 Annual Report).
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Government acknowledges the merit of the general principle of calling tenders for road construction work. The major deficiences which existed in the system at the time the Hawke Government came to office resulted from the legislative requirements developed by the previous Government. All Federally funded national road construction works and all arterial road construction works funded under the ABRD Program were required to be put to tender, with no provision for the requirement to be waived in circumstances where calling of tenders was either impractical or not cost effective.
      </para>
      <para>
       These deficiencies have been substantially overcome by amendments to the Roads Grants Act and Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund Act which provide for the requirement to call tenders to be waived in circumstances where a State satisfied the Federal Minister that
      </para>
      <para>
       - there is an emergency requirement for works to be undertaken
      </para>
      <para>
       - the works are so minor that invitation of tenders would involve undue additional cost
      </para>
      <para>
       - it would not be practical to prepare adequate tender specifications
      </para>
      <para>
       - or competitive tenders would be unlikely to be received.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) and (4) The effective use of public funds requires the States and Local Government to maintain viable day labour forces to ensure that they can undertake works which are urgent or for which suitable contractors either do not tender or do not submit competitive bids. The Government therefore sees the tender and contract and day labour force arrangements as complementary rather than mutually exclusive. In these circumstances the Government considers that no useful purpose would be served by undertaking a formal comparative assessment of the costs/benefits of tender and contract system as against the day labour system.

       (1) The Commonwealth has committed $30m over the 1984-85 and next two financial years for community infrastructure and service projects which will not only maximise the benefits and minimise the detrimental effects of the staging of the America's Cup on the local community but also provide facilities of long term community benefit. An amount of $6m is expected to be spent on these projects in 1984-85.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Commonwealth's assistance is being made available by way of the Annual Appropriation Acts. Funds for disbursement in 1984-85 have been appropriated under Division 866-02, Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1984-85.
      </para>
      <para>
       Projects for which funds have been made available include:
      </para>
      <para>
       commissioning a number of urgent studies on the likely impact of the Cup defence such as the expected visitor influx on local infrastructure and services;
      </para>
      <para>
       providing adequate accommodation, and in particular increasing the stock of public housing, to ensure that those in need will not be forced to seek accommodation elsewhere at a time of high housing demand in and around Fremantle;
      </para>
      <para>
       improvements in transport and pedestrian facilities;
      </para>
      <para>
       the protection and enhancement of the National Estate; and
      </para>
      <para>
       development of appropriate community facilities and services.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth's continuing concern will be directed towards the severe and unequal demands which the Cup defence might place on community facilities and services.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) (a) The America's Cup secretariat, styled the America's Cup Support Group, provides a focus and point of contact for Commonwealth involvement in America's Cup matters. In addition to the development of an appropriate financial assistance program, the Support Group seeks to ensure that, on America's Cup matters, effective consultation is maintained between Commonwealth and State departments and authorities, local government and community groups.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The Intergovernmental Committee on America's Cup Matters seeks to ensure the fullest co-operation and co-ordination between Commonwealth, State and local government. The Committee reflects the legitimate concern of all three levels of government for the consequences which will arise from the staging of an event of national and international significance.
      </para>
      <para>
       The direct involvement of the Fremantle City Council recognises the particular concerns it will have in dealing with a wide range of activities and developments in this regard.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) A wide range of Commonwealth agencies-for example those responsible for customs, immigration, aviation, communications-have in the discharge of their ongoing responsibilities, become involved in America's Cup matters. The Commonwealth is committed to ensuring that this involvement is appropriate and effective.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Australia's involvement in research in electromagnetic rail gun technology arose in the late 1970s out of interest in the possible applications of rail gun technologies for use by the Australian Defence Forces in non-nuclear tactical weapons, such as anti-tank weapons for the Army; and subsequently for their potential for the defence of ships against surface skimming missiles. No other applications are envisaged by Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) All information generated by Australian rail gun research has been unclassified and is available through the normal scientific channels used to convey such information. As such it is freely available to all countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No. Australia has examined the United States allegations and will continue to do so. Such conclusions as Australia may reach from time to time will be expressed independently.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Australia's attitude to SDI has not been expressed in those terms. Australia is concerned over the possible implications of SDI and the comparable Soviet research program for arms control and for the maintenance of a strategic balance between the superpowers. This view has been expressed publicly and privately on many occasions. During his February visit to Washington the Prime Minister said explicitly that Australia does not endorse the United States Strategic Defence Initiative. Similar Australian concerns have also been registered with the Soviet Union which is believed to be undertaking its own research into technologies for use in a possible system of ballistic missile defence. The Government has also made known to the nuclear weapons States, particularly the superpowers, on a number of occasions, its concern that they should do everything in their power to adhere to their international disarmament and arms control obligations, including those under the ABM Treaty, and where relevant those acquired under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) (a) President Mitterrand's view that there should be international agreements to prevent an Arms Race in Outer Space coincides with the views expressed by Australia on many occasions.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) As indicated above, Australia has expressed concern that both United States and Soviet research programs should not lead to deployments of new weapons that would negate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The remarks attributed to President Mitterand would seem to be in the same sense.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) I am not aware that the Vatican has called explicitly for a convention on the uses of space as a global heritage similar to the Law of the Sea Convention. It is the case however that the Vatican has called for an international treaty to prevent a spiral of competitive deployment of weapons in space in order to ensure the continual availability to all nations of the benefits of space exploration and exploitation, and to preserve the contribution to international security and national security made by existing satellite systems and those which might augment them. The Government fully supports the sentiments and objectives of the Vatican's call, which was outlined most recently in the conclusions of a study week on the impact of space exploration on mankind held by the Pontifical Academy of Science from 1-5 October 1984: but the Government is not convinced that it will prove practical for these worthwhile objectives to be achieved through a single multilateral instrument. Both bilateral and multi- lateral agreements will almost certainly be necessary, as was recognised by the Vatican when it stated, in the context of its treaty call, that 'the necessity for an eventual international multilateral agreement should not delay an urgently needed bilateral agreement to this end between the two leading space powers'.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government places great importance on the prevention of an arms race in outer space and Australian Ministers have called repeatedly for negotiations towards agreement on outer space arms control. As the Prime Minister stated on 6 November 1984 we see the militarisation of outer space as a development fraught with great risk and uncertainty. The Government is working hard in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva for the prevention of an arms race in outer space and welcomes the recent decision by the Conference to establish an Ad Hoc Committee to examine outer space arms control issues. It is also working actively to promote the peaceful uses of outer space in the United Nations Committee in New York established for that purpose. I would note further that the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies, which Australia ratified on 10 October 1967, already provides that outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means (Article II). The Treaty also provides that the exploration and use of outer space 'shall be the province of all mankind' (Article I). The Treaty provides that the use of space shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries, irrespective of their degree of economic or scientific development.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) I am not aware of the United States Defense Secretary, Mr Weinberger, having used the precise words attributed to him in the question. However, the Secretary and other United States officials from President Reagan down have said on many occasions that their motivation in pursuing SDI is to explore the possibility that defensive weapons may, over the next few decades, make it possible to replace deterrence based on the threat of mutually assured destruction with a preferable basis for security. The Australian Government does not doubt the sincerity of this motivation. Australian policy also aims at replacing deterrence based on the threat of mutual destruction with a preferable basis for security but has not endorsed SDI as the means to this end. The Australian Government believes that the maintenance of a stable deterrence is an essential precondition for progress towards disarmament, in particular for deep cuts in the high stockpiles of nuclear weapons, and does not believe it would be possible to abandon deterrence before a preferable basis for security is in place. Its position in relation to the Australia-United States Joint Facilities remains as previously stated, notably by the Prime Minister to Parliament on 6 June 1984.

       (1) The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal discussed this issue at length in its published Report into the Grant of a Category S Public Broadcasting Station Licence to service the Canberra Statistical District, para 11.29 to 11.63. In essence the Tribunal concluded that the extent of the involvement of the ACT Gaming and Liquor Authority in the applicant group, Canberra and District Racing and Sporting Broadcasters 'does not warrant the disqualification of CDRSB from holding a licence'.

      <para>
       (2) No. There would seem to be no basis for this interpretation of the Tribunal's decision.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) FM is suitable for providing a range of different radio services, whether in spoken or mixed form. It is a fact that FM has come to be associated with music in Australia because of the excellent quality of stereo transmissions. It should however be noted that the particular propagation characteristics of FM mean that a service can be tailored to serve the intended area, unlike AM, which is subject to the 'skywave' effect. For this reason FM frequencies can be allocated in a number of different places without causing unacceptable interference. The public broadcasting sector has been developed largely on FM, with only five of the existing 53 stations broadcasting on AM.

       (3) and (4) Telecom would not wish to supply company names as requested. Over the years, the 'public tender' system of purchasing goods and/or services has been a secure and highly ethical arrangement and very successful. This success is due, in the main, to Telecom treating each and every tender submitted on a strictly 'Commercial-in-Confidence' basis. Provision of the company names requested would represent a departure from this well established policy of confidentiality.

      <para>
       The term 'ex gratia' is taken to mean act of grace payments authorised under section 34A of the Audit Act 1901.
      </para>
      <para>
       No payments pursuant to that section have been made since 5 March 1983 in respect of legal costs to or for Ministers or judges.
      </para>
      <para>
       In respect of legal costs to or for the public officials during the period in question, approvals were given in two cases. A payment was approved in July 1983 to reimburse an employee of the then Capital Territory Health Commission his legal expenses in respect of litigation with the Commission; the costs reimbursed under that authorisation amounted to $46,229,03. A payment of $380.20 was approved in May 1984 in respect of a fine ($350) and the court costs ($30.20) of a Commonwealth officer who was prosecuted under State law (relating to fire bans) in respect of certain actions he took in the course of his Commonwealth duties.
      </para>
      <para>
       These payments were made under act of grace arrangements in that they fell outside the normal policy, expressed in Section 21 of the Finance Directions, whereby departments, in consultation with the Australian Government Solicitor, may meet the cost of the legal defence of officials in litigation against them arising out of their Commonwealth duties.

       Of the commodities mentioned by Mr Andrew only wheat, including wheat flour, has been sent as aid to the Horn of Africa.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Wheat Board is the only supplier of wheat to the Australian aid program. It quotes prices to the Australian Development Assistance Bureau in U.S. dollars. The prices quoted reflect movements in international wheat markets. It is estimated that the devaluation of the Australian dollar has added some $256,000 to the cost of the 50,850 MTN of wheat shipped as aid to the Horn of Africa this financial year. This is net of cost variations caused by market movements.
      </para>
      <para>
       Wheat flour shipments were not similarly affected by devaluation as they are provided through public tenders called by the Australian Development Assistance Bureau and contractual arrangements are based on Australian dollar prices.

       The Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio and television networks are very extensive, currently operating through more than 400 transmitting sites across Australia.

      </para>

       However, the planning, construction and ongoing operation of these significant networks requires the application of considerable resources. Timetables and priorities must be established, and it is inevitable that there will be delays in the establishment of new facilities in some areas. Extension of the ABC's FM-stereo service to the Goulburn Valley region is included in my Department's long term planning program but, with regret, I must advise that new ABC-FM facilities are unlikely to be available before at least 1990.

       4. SPEC's role is to promote and co-ordinate the development policies of the South Pacific Island Governments in a number of key sectors. Major current activities and programs are as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       TRADE
      </para>
      <para>
       SPEC's trade activities cover trade promotion, the identification and development of export-oriented industries and the negotiation of export opportunities. Following a study of trade relations and industrial development in the South Pacific, SPEC co-ordinated and assisted island countries in the negotiation of the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Co-operation Agreement (SPARTECA), a major step in the expansion of export markets and impetus to the development of island export-based industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       To promote the flow of island products to Australian markets, the South Pacific Trade Commission was established in May 1979 in Sydney under SPEC auspices, with the financial backing of the Australian Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       An in-depth investigation into the prospects for closer economic co-operation among Island members of SPEC has been completed and market surveys beyond the region have also been undertaken, notably in Japan and the United States.
      </para>
      <para>
       A United Nations Development Program-funded project for trade promotion, advisory services and training is located at SPEC. Recent research, with outside assistance, has included a South Pacific industrial survey, a study on the harmonisation of industrial incentives, an investigation of bulk purchasing possibilities and a study of regional crop insurance.
      </para>
      <para>
       SPEC has been instrumental in setting up arrangements such as the Regional Taro Agreement and the Regional Long-Term Sugar Agreement.
      </para>
      <para>
       TRANSPORT
      </para>
      <para>
       Regional transport is an important part of SPEC's activities. The assignment to SPEC in 1972 of the tasks of studying the financial and operational structure of a regional shipping line reflected the priority which island leaders attached to the concept, and to the linkage between trade and transport in the South Pacific region. As a result the Regional Shipping Council and its Advisory Board was formed in 1974 and in 1976 the Forum endorsed the formation of the Pacific Forum Line as a regional shipping venture. The documents establishing the Line were finalised in 1977.
      </para>
      <para>
       SPEC is also involved in other shipping matters including wage rates and working conditions for island seamen and uniform maritime standards for the region.
      </para>
      <para>
       Following a decision by the Rotorua Forum meeting in 1976, a Regional Civil Aviation Council and an Advisory Committee were established.
      </para>
      <para>
       TELECOMMUNICATIONS
      </para>
      <para>
       Telecommunications has been another major field of SPEC activity, following the decision of the 1973 Forum that SPEC should act as the co-ordinating agency for telecommunications work being undertaken in the South Pacific by the United Nations and other agencies. Technical support has been provided to SPEC by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
      </para>
      <para>
       ENERGY
      </para>
      <para>
       Energy, including alternative energy sources, has become a top priority of SPEC member Governments. Following a study on appropriate regional institutional arrangements for energy matters, the Forum decided in 1981 that SPEC should assume the role of overall regional energy co-ordinator. A SPEC energy unit was established in 1982 to carry out this responsibility.
      </para>
      <para>
       AID
      </para>
      <para>
       Aid co-ordination and in particular the development and implementation of regional aid projects funded by the EEC under the Lome Convention are another activity for which SPEC is responsible. Since 1981 SPEC has also acted as the Secretariat to the Africa-Caribbean-Pacific Group Council which meets annually.
      </para>
      <para>
       ADVISORY SERVICE
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1981 Forum Leaders decided that a Pacific Regional Advisory Service (PRAS) should be established under the auspices of SPEC. PRAS has two main functions-to maintain a systematic register of skilled personnel existing within Pacific Island countries which would be available to meet requests from governments in the region, and to facilitate transfers of such personnel.
      </para>
      <para>
       OTHER
      </para>
      <para>
       SPEC administers the SPEC Fellowship Scheme funded by the Governments of Australia and New Zealand and the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation (CFTC). The fellowship scheme provides in-service training in island member countries for two candidates per country per year.
      </para>
      <para>
       SPEC manages a Regional Disaster Relief Fund which provides monetary assistance to countries in the region suffering from the effects of natural disasters and is involved in disaster preparedness co-ordination.
      </para>
      <para>
       Special attention is given by SPEC to the problems of smaller island countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       SPEC participates in the South Pacific Regional Environment Program (SPREP) which is a co-operative effort between SPEC and SPC along with UN agencies working in the region. The program is aimed at co-ordinating and assisting Pacific island countries with the proper management of their environment and resources.
      </para>
      <para>
       SPEC is continuing to develop areas in its work program which will assist member countries. Investigations into the possibility of establishing a Pacific Islands Fund are being undertaken, regional priorities for development planning have been established and the positions of Regional Export Marketing Adviser and Regional Handicrafts Adviser have been created with outside assistance.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes. The equipment records the numbers dialled, the length of the call and the date and time at which the call was made. It does not record the destination of the call but this can be deduced from the number dialled.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) and (3) Yes. Section 7 (2) (a) of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 which allows for the use of the equipment for the operation and maintenance of the telephone network and the identifying or tracing of any person involved in contravening the Telecommunications Act 1975 or any regulation or by-law in force under that Act, for example, in the case of harassing, menacing and fictitious calls.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Generally, yes. In the case of billing complaints, experience has shown that advance knowledge of its use can result in subscribers reducing their normal calling patterns. However, use of the equipment in some circumstances is requested by subscribers.
      </para>
      <para>
       Telecom has a responsibility to its customers to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the telephone network and in a number of instances use of the equipment is the only means of demonstrating this accuracy in order to resolve satisfactorily a billing complaint.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) Because of the extensive use made of the equipment such information is not maintained.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Separate costs are not maintained.

       (1) On 27 July 1984 a Perth Magistrate refused to extradite Wilfrid Henry Tolhurst and Peter John Snow in respect of any of the charges against them. On the same date the magistrate ordered that Ronald Warren Woss appear at the Brisbane Magistrates Court on 26 October 1984 in respect of two of the seven charges against him. An appeal filed in the Supreme Court of Western Australia against the decision of the magistrate in all three cases was successful and an appeal to the Full Court of the Supreme Court has been lodged. The appeal to the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia has been adjourned ''sine die'' pending the handing down of the reserved decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court.

      <para>
       Woss made application to the Federal Court for an order for review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act in respect of the magistrate's decision to extradite him on the two charges. This application was unsuccessful and Woss then appealed to the Full Court of the Federal Court. The Full Court has reserved its decision.

       (2) Brian James Maher has been committed for trial. The trial Judge gave a certificate under the Judiciary Act that Mr Maher was without adequate means to provide private defence for himself. Government financial assistance was however refused to Mr Maher who thereupon applied for review by the Federal Court under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act (ADJR Act). As a result of the Federal Court's order certain terms of financial assistance were communicated to Mr Maher. However these terms of financial assistance were rejected by Mr Maher who made a second application to the Federal Court under the ADJR Act as a result of which the trial, having commenced on 7 May 1985, was further adjourned pending the Federal Court hearing on 24 May 1985. The Solicitor, who gave evidence at that hearing, said that he would accept the terms of financial assistance and act for Mr Maher, however, subsequently withdrew his services. Negotiations were still proceeding on 6 June 1985 towards appointing another solicitor and counsel to act for Mr Maher on financial assistance.

      <para>
       (1) On 1 March 1985, Mr Justice Franki ordered that the Commission pay 85 per cent of the defendant's costs, other than those of Youngs Transport Ltd. The Court found that all the defendants (with the exception of Youngs which is in liquidation and thus was not represented at the hearing) were involved at least in most of the various unsuccessful objections which occupied a considerable amount of the Court's time in relation to one lengthy issue. Accordingly the Court considered the Commission's claim for abatement of costs was justified in part. The Commission was ordered to pay the full costs of Youngs Transport Ltd. However, since that company took no active part in the hearing, those costs will be proportionately quite small.

When the Embassy made inquiries about Mr Shukhevych in May 1984, it was informed that cases for emigration would only be considered where applications had been made by the individuals concerned to the competent local authorities. It would seem, therefore, that there is nothing more that the Embassy can do on behalf of Mr Shukhevych or Mrs Meshko until they actually apply to migrate to Australia.

The type of duties performed by the employees who have submitted these claims include; keyboard (69), Clerical Administrative (7), Clerical Assistant (5), Carpenter (2), Line Supervisor (2), Airport Traffic Officer (1), Air Traffic Controller, Class 5 (1), Assistant Research Officer (1), Stores Supervisor (1), Senior Mechanic (1), and Lineman (1).

       (3) 27. Affected officers were informally redeployed to activities which did not aggravate the condition and gradually returned to normal duties when medical opinion indicated that it was safe to do so.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition the services of an Occupational Therapist were obtained to help individual officers. Where appropriate also, officers were encouraged to make full use of the Department's Staff Assistance Scheme through the resident Staff Counsellors.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Ergonomic furniture is being provided for use by Departmental officers in keyboard positions; it has been already issued to most officers and the remainder will be provided in the near future. The Department will continue to use the services of an Occupational Therapist. A repetitive strain injury (RSI) awareness and management program has been introduced which is directed at keyboard staff, and just as importantly at Departmental Managers. This program involves provision for regular, specifically designed exercises and compulsory rest breaks. In addition a reporting and monitoring system is in place ensuring early advice of the manifestation of the symptoms of RSI.
      </para>
      <para>
       Finally the Department has put a submission to the Repetitive Strain Injury Task Force. In part this submission recommended a full scale study into all aspects (particularly Medical) of RSI, since insufficient information is presently available on which to base well considered programs of prevention.

       (2) Some staff shortages are being experienced with the main area of shortage being in the nursing category. However, problems have been experienced in recruiting therapists, radiologists, various categories of specialists and general technical staff owing, in part, to salary disparities between Commonwealth and State rates. Other contributing factors are the shortage of particular skills in some employment groups in the community.

       Yes. The provision of 008 service telephone numbers for all passport clients is under active consideration by my Department. As the first step, equipment is being installed in the Department's Central Office in Canberra on a six month trial basis. The equipment will enable dedicated telephone answering staff to handle calls made to the Sydney Passports Office. Based on the data this facility will provide and the concurrent examination of extending this arrangement to other Passports Offices, consideration will be given to providing an Australia-wide 008 facility for all passport inquiries.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The principal legislation at the Commonwealth level dealing generally with unfair business practices is the Trade Practices Act 1974. Division 1, Part V of that Act contains a general prohibition on misleading or deceptive conduct and specific prohibitions on particular examples of unfair conduct. Section 53A states that a corporation shall not, in connexion with the sale or grant of an interest in land, make a false or misleading statement concerning the nature of the interest in the land, the price payable, the location or characteristics of the land, the use to which the land may be put or the existence or availability of facilities associated with the land. Section 59 (2) provides that where a corporation invites persons to participate in a business activity requiring the investment of moneys and the performance of work by the persons involved, the corporation shall not make, with respect to the profitability or risk or any other material aspect of the business activity, a statement that is false or misleading in a material particular. The latter section is directed at the case where a person buys a business on the basis of a statement by the seller as to the profitability of the business, which subsequently proves false. In addition, section 52 generally prohibits, on a civil basis, a corporation, in trade or commerce, engaging in conduct that is deceptive or misleading or likely to mislead or deceive.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is no general Commonwealth legislation, which applies throughout Australia, dealing with landlords and tenants, or with commercial leasing practices. This area is seen as one for the State and Territory Governments to control, given the constitutional limitations on the Commonwealth's power.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Trade Practices Act 1974 applies throughout Australia, although it is generally limited in its application to the conduct of corporations. The reason for this is that the legislative basis for the Act is the corporations' power (s. 51(xx)) of the Constitution. However, by virtue of section 6 of the Act, it also applies to the conduct of individuals in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. This extended application has its constitutional basis in the Territories' power (s. 122) of the Constitution.
      </para>
      <para>
       I understand that the ACT Landlords and Tenants Ordinance applies only to domestic leases. I also understand that there are proposals for an ACT commercial leases ordinance which would provide some assistance to commercial tenants, but these proposals are only at a preliminary stage.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) and (4) I understand such practices as these may be engaged in by landlords. There is presently no Commonwealth legislation dealing with these specific practices. To the extent that they may be unconscionable in particular circumstances, it is pertinent to note the Green Paper entitled 'The Trade Practices Act-Proposals for Change' issued in February 1984, wherein the Government proposed to introduce a section in the Trade Practices Act prohibiting unconscionable conduct in relation to a contract or proposed contract. Such a section, if enacted, may have application to the practices mentioned in (3), but the Government has yet to make a final decision about the proposal.

       Numerous payments are made direct to community based organisations under legislative authority other than the Acts referred to in the question. In addition, block grants are paid under some programs, to the States/Territories, which determine distribution to individual organisations. It would not be possible to identify all organisations deriving assistance from these sources without diverting staffing resources from other critical tasks.

Under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act, it is the lack of knowledge which renders such interception unlawful.'

       (1) One of the objectives of the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, as expressed in the preamble, is 'to avert the potential dangers posed by the unlawful taking and use of nuclear material'. As recognised, for example, in Australia's bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements and those of other suppliers, the physical protection of nuclear material is an important complementary control to international safeguards in seeking to ensure that nuclear material for peaceful purposes remains within the peaceful nuclear fuel cycle. The Convention, in that it seeks to protect nuclear material from theft and misuse, contributes towards the prevention of nuclear weapons proliferation.

       (2) The main obligation of parties to the Convention is to establish and maintain certain standards for the physical protection of nuclear material against theft during international transport. Parties are also called on to co-operate in recovering any nuclear material which may be stolen and in dealing with offences involving such material. The Convention defines certain serious offences involving nuclear material which parties are to make punishable and for which offenders will be subject to extradition or prosecution.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Australia will be working actively before and at the third Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), to be held in Geneva in September 1985, to reduce further the dangers of horizontal proliferation. One particular means which Australia will be pursuing is the acceptance pursuant to Article III.2 of the treaty of fullscope safeguards as a condition of nuclear supply to non-nuclear weapon states not parties to the NPT. With regard to the second part of the question, preventing nuclear devices from falling into the hands of terrorist groups has always been one of the factors in the determination of appropriate safeguards and physical protection measures. (See Part (2) below). I have interpreted nuclear devices as meaning nuclear explosive devices.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) With respect to nuclear explosive devices, the three nuclear weapon states parties to the NPT have an international legally-binding obligation under Article I of the treaty not to transfer such devices or control over them to any recipient whatsoever. The two nuclear weapon states which are not parties to the NPT have a policy which reflects that approach.
      </para>
      <para>
       The non-nuclear weapon states parties to the NPT have accepted in Article II of the treaty an international legally-binding obligation not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices and not to seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. Moreover, reading Articles I and II together with the preamble and the object and purposes of the treaty, the non-nuclear weapon states parties to the NPT also are enjoined from engaging in the sort of activity from which the nuclear weapon states are prohibited by Article I.
      </para>
      <para>
       Parties to the Treaty of Tlatelolco which have brought that treaty into force accept an international legally-binding obligation to use nuclear material and facilities under their jurisdiction exclusively for peaceful purposes. In more specific terms, they also accept obligations to prescribe the deployment, testing, use or manufacture of nuclear weapons in their territories and to themselves refrain from the manufacture or possession of any nuclear weapon. Non-nuclear weapon states which are parties to the NPT and states which are parties to the Treaty of Tlatelolco which have brought that Treaty into force also accept international safeguards to verify their non-proliferation commitments. Safeguards are applied through an international legally-binding agreement with the IAEA. Compliance with the obligations in the agreements are monitored and overseen by the IAEA and its Board of Governors. Safeguards verify the non-diversion of safeguarded nuclear material for peaceful purposes.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the operation of safeguards, as applied pursuant to obligations in the NPT and the Treaty of Tlatelolco, the international transfer of nuclear material to non-nuclear weapon states is recorded. Many suppliers, such as Australia, also have bilateral requirements including that of prior consent over re-transfers. In Australia's case, an eligible destination for end-use of Australian origin nuclear material is a country with which Australia has a bilateral nuclear safeguards agreement in force. Safeguarded nuclear material, therefore, could not be passed to extra-national groups without its detection and, in many cases, the prior consent of the supplier. In the latter instance, where suppliers have undertaken international non-proliferation commitments, such transfers would be in breach of those commitments. Certain other countries, not in any of the above categories of states, have not entered into any comparable international legal obligations concerning non-proliferation and may or may not require IAEA safeguards on their nuclear exports. In a small number of such non nuclear weapon states which have unsafeguarded nuclear facilities, the passing of nuclear material from such facilities to extra-national political groups is theoretically possible, although unlikely for national security reasons.
      </para>
      <para>
       This possibility, nevertheless, underlines the importance of universal adherence to the NPT or, at a minimum, universal acceptance of fullscope safeguards under the IAEA-a current Australian objective as outlined in Part (1) above.

       With respect to the possible illicit manufacture of nuclear explosive devices, the major nuclear suppliers and consumers have accepted international legal obligations-such as are in Australia's bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements-to apply physical protection in accordance with standards recommended by the International Atomic Energy Agency. These physical protection obligations are the principal means of preventing nuclear items falling into the hands of terrorist groups. The first NPT Review Conference in 1975 recommended the negotiation of an international convention of the physical protection of nuclear material. Negotiations on such a convention were completed in 1979. The convention has so far attracted forty signatures and twelve ratifications, nine short of the number required to bring it into force. Upon its entry into force, the convention will supplement existing bilateral arrangements. Australia signed the convention on 22 February 1985 and is actively considering the steps required for its ratification.

       (6) No connection between the illnesses and exposure to radiation or chemical hazards has been established. Since 1978 there have been three compensation claims concerning persons who have died or retired prematurely on grounds of invalidity claimed to be work-related. One heart disease claim was accepted as due to stress. One cancer claim has yet to be determined by the Commissioner for Employees Compensation and another was disallowed and is now subject of an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. A further cancer claim involving a former employee who resigned after 1978 and later died is also to be determined.

Any authorised official expenditure is subsequently reimbursed by the Department to the officer subject to the provisions of the Audit Act and other relevant legislation. With the exception that officers may not use credit cards to arrange official travel bookings or to pay for fares for official travel, there are no other limitations placed on the usage of the cards. Other charges, including interest etc. that the officer chooses to incur in using these cards are the personal responsibility of that officer.

       (3) There are normally no membership or service fees applicable to TAA, Ansett or Telecom credit cards. In respect of AMEX and Diners Club credit cards, a Departmental Secretary may approve reimbursement of the annual membership fee to an officer in accordance with Finance Direction 34/25. AMEX and Diners Club have introduced special annual membership rates for officers who apply for and are issued with credit cards through ''Corporate Card'' Schemes that were negotiated with the Department of Finance-usually of the order of $10-12.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The issue of TAA, Ansett and Telecom credit cards to nominated senior officers eg, Departmental Secretaries and their Deputies has been longstanding. There are no restrictions on the level of officers who may apply for AMEX or Diners Club credit cards. However, before a credit card is issued under the 'Corporate Card' Scheme, a Department must be satisfied that the officer has a 'work-related' need for the card.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) TAA, Ansett and Telecom credit cards are intended for use by senior officers where there is an urgent need to use the services of those bodies for official purposes in circumstances that do not allow the usual procedures to be followed, such as outside normal business hours or in locations remote from the Department's office.
      </para>
      <para>
       AMEX and Diners Club cards are subject to the limitations placed on the cards by AMEX or Diners Club. Officers are responsible to meet all expenditure charged to their card account. Expenditure of an official nature incurred by the use of credit cards is subject to normal reimbursement procedures to which the disciplines of the Audit Act and other relevant legislation are applied. Other charges including interest etc, that the officer chooses to incur in using these cards are the personal responsibility of that officer.

       Yes. The staff have been allocated to Direct Client Services (especially to Hospitals, Aged and Extended Care Departments, the Vietnam Veterans' Counselling Service), Pensions/Benefits functions, Administrative functions and part time staff represented as full time equivalents (approximately 10 per cent are employed in Repatriation hospitals).
      </para>
      <para>
       The main reasons for the increase in staff have been the increases in demand for services in the hospitals and the larger numbers of claims for pensions. In addition, the appalling squeeze of justified staffing under the Fraser Government has had to be overcome to provide satisfactory services to veterans and war widows.

       Disability pensions, including the General Rate and Special Rate, and family allowances are excluded from consideration as income for the payment of service pensions. Disability pension was exempted in part, for service pension assessment in 1973 and this exemption was extended progressively until it became totally exempt in 1982. Family allowances have been specifically exempted as income for service pension since 1947. The present Government has maintained these exemptions.

Various attempts have been made to estimate participation rates for earlier periods using relevant Census data, however, the concepts of participation used and the methods of data collection mean they are not strictly comparable with the labour force survey estimates since 1966. Nevertheless, while estimated participation rates are not available for the years requested, an indication of participation rate movements over the period can be gained from Census based estimates by Dr M.

The Government has also inserted a new s.29D into the Crimes Act 1914 creating the substantive offence of defrauding the Commonwealth or a public authority under the Commonwealth.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) In late March 1985, the European Community, Spain and Portugal virtually concluded negotiations on the terms for accession to the European Community of Spain and Portugal. Accession Treaties are expected to be signed in June and then be ratified by national parliaments, to enable entry on 1 January 1986.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australian trade with the Iberian states in 1983-84 amounted to $A118.9m worth of exports and $A114.2m worth of imports. Australia's main exports were raw materials consisting of coal ($A52m), wool and hides ($A25m) and iron ore ($A7.5m).
      </para>
      <para>
       Exports of food items have not been relatively large and have fluctuated in terms of quantity and type of product during recent years.
      </para>
      <para>
       The transitional accession periods range from seven to ten years for agricultural products and up to seven years for manufactured products. During these periods tariffs and other border measures will be adjusted and EC farm policies will be phased in. Consequently, it is difficult to assess the trade effects of enlargement but one would not expect there to be immediate problems for the bulk of Australian exports.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) It is not possible to determine at this stage specific long term problems that may arise for Australian exporters. Spain will also accede to the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) which imposes quantitative controls on steel production in the Member States. Depending on the treatment of Spanish steel production by the ECSC, Australia's exports of coal and iron ore could be affected. It is not anticipated that exports of wool and hides would be affected.
      </para>
      <para>
       The gradual adoption of lower EC tariffs on manufactured goods could provide increased export opportunities in Spain for Australian manufactured products.
      </para>
      <para>
       It could be expected however that production of Spanish fruit could be encouraged by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) which could have implications for Australian exports to the EC and to third markets.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) In 1983, per capita GDP was $A4,591 in Spain and $A2,268 in Portugal. Data on farm incomes is not available. However, a report by the Commission of the European Communities in 1979 indicated that farm income in Spain in 1978 was 'only 47 per cent of average farm incomes per head in the Community'.

       The Rural Development Centre at the University of New England, previously known as the Australian Rural Adjustment Unit, is in no way related to the Commonwealth Government or the Department of Primary Industry. It is an autonomous and independent research body. I announced on 26 March 1985 that the Commonwealth will provide funds of $160,000 per annum to allow the Centre to continue its valuable work in researching and promoting awareness of rural economic and social issues following the withdrawal of funding by the Kellogg Foundation of the United States.

In cases where pensioners owned real estate (other than the home) and the total value of their assets would have led to reduction in pension; or where the total value was within $20,000 of the allowable limit; or where the departmental officer was not satisfied with the pensioner's estimate, the real estate values were checked by officers of the Valuations Branch of the Australian Taxation Office.

       Domremy College has notified the Commonwealth Schools Commission of its intention to commence senior secondary education (Years 11 and 12) in 1986. In accord with the Government's policy relating to new non-government schools (including schools increasing the levels of education provided), eligibility for Commonwealth recurrent funding will be determined within a framework of planned educational provision. High priority for funding will be given to schools extending the levels of education provided in ways which are consistent with planned educational provision and which relate to the logical completion of a stage of schooling. New schools in 1986 should be advised of their eligibility for Commonwealth funding in about September this year.

       Should productivity increases in Gross Domestic Product be used to create new and permanent jobs for the unemployed; if so, will the Government argue against the Australian Council of Trade Unions to prevent productivity increases being passed on to wage and salary earners to the detriment of the unemployed.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Government has always acknowledged-as do the Wage-fixing Principles-that there would come a time when it was appropriate for Australians in jobs to share in economic recovery through the distribution of productivity gains. However, our first concern is to ensure preservation of the strong employment growth with moderate inflation that has been achieved over the last two years. Any productivity based improvement in wages or conditions of employment must be of an appropriate size, and timing, as to be consistent with these objectives.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Accord acknowledges that distribution of productivity gains to wage and salary earners is an important element of a viable prices and incomes policy. However it also recognises the primary aim of restoring full employment. The Accord provides a framework in which discussions can take place to solve any difficulties involved in meeting both of these goals.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the Government's Prices and Incomes Policy, which is based on the Accord, there has been a dramatic turnaround in the economy. Real gross non-farm product has risen by 9.5 per cent since the trough in the June quarter 1983 and over 300,000 jobs have been created since the Summit in April 1983. The unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 10.4 per cent to 8.5 per cent and inflation has been halved, to around 5.5 per cent, even when the effects of Medicare are excluded. During this period of rapid economic growth award wages have shown very moderate increases and both the profit share and real unit labour costs are not back near their levels of the late 1960s and early 1970s.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, in the context of the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar, the Government has indicated that any sustained depreciation requires a lesser real wage than would otherwise have applied. One way of achieving this is via a delaying of any productivity case. The Government has yet to take a final decision on how best to handle the price effects of devaluation. It has indicated that the questions of the size, timing and phasing of any productivity increase should be deferred until the scope of the depreciation and the extent of its effect on the economy become apparent.
      </para>
      <para>
       The best policy for sustaining growth, and thus helping the unemployed, is to maintain the Accord and the Prices and Incomes Policy. The question of how any productivity case will be handled will be discussed within the framework of the Accord to ensure the best possible result for the country as a whole.

       (a) In accordance with the emphasis on pensioner self-assessment, wherever possible the pensioners' estimates of the value of their assets were accepted. Some checking was required for certain items, for example, the value of shares was checked against current share listings in the financial press. In cases where pensioners owned real estate (other than the home) and the total value of their assets would have led to reduction in pension; or where the total value was within $20,000 of the allowable limit; or where the departmental officer was not satisfied with the pensioner's estimate, the real estate values were checked by officers of the Valuations Branch of the Australian Taxation Office.

       (1) On 21 May 1985 the Special Minister of State made a statement to the House of Representatives concerning the Government's response to recommendations contained in the Final Report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. In relation to the Commission's recommendation for the establishment of a Taxation Investigation Tribunal and a Special Taxation Investigator (crime), the Government considered the creation of such bodies as being unnecessary as they would duplicate the work of existing agencies such as the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Federal Police, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the National Crime Authority. In recommending these new bodies, the Commission expressed concern regarding insignificant penalties for non-compliance to a request for information pursuant to section 264 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (ITA Act) and the use of the defence of 'self-incrimination' where such a request was made. It should be noted that these matters were addressed in the Taxation Laws Amendment Act 1984 (TLA Act) passed prior to the receipt of the Commission's final report. That Act significantly increased the maximum penalty for a failure to comply with a request made pursuant to section 264 of the ITA Act and also provided a tiered penalty structure including a liability to imprisonment for second and subsequent breaches of section 264. The TLA Act also made it clear that 'self-incrimination' is not a defence to a charge of failing to comply with a legal requirement under a taxation law.

       The Prime Minister has recently written to the Premiers and the Chief Minister informing them that, as indicated at the Conference, the Commonwealth is prepared to extend telephone interception powers to State police in relation to drug trafficking. He made it clear that any such access would be subject to acceptance by the States of both strict controls and the costs of interception operations.

       There will need to be close consultation between the Commonwealth and those States seeking access to telephone interception powers in the development of detailed proposals. The system of controls, which would need to involve State as well as Commonwealth legislation, would include judicial warrants, audits of interception operations by a State Ombudsman (or like independent State authority) and reports to the State Attorney-General who, in turn, would report periodically to the Commonwealth Attorney-General on reasons for, and results of, interceptions.

       (3) The research in this area included both a survey and interviews with over 200 people working in or directly or indirectly involved in the area. The results of the surveys and interview material have been used in the preparation of Contempt Research Papers 2, 5 and 6A (already completed). Interview material formed the basis of the research in Research Paper 6A (contempt of the Family Court). The Research Paper on prejudicial publicity (Research Paper 4), currently being written, will also rely a great deal upon material from interviews. The Commission considers that the material will also be valuable for other consultative papers and the final report to Parliament.

       (a) In accordance with the emphasis on pensioner self-assessment, wherever possible the pensioners' estimates of the value of their assets were accepted. Some checking was required for certain items, for example, the value of shares was checked against current share listings in the financial press. In cases where pensioners owned real estate (other than the home) and the total value of their assets would have led to reduction in pension; or where the total value was within $20,000 of the allowable limit; or where the departmental officer was not satisfied with the pensioner's estimate, the real estate values were checked by officers of the Valuations Branch of the Australian Taxation Office.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) (a) and (b) There were two information campaigns dealing with the assets test-one conducted by the Department of Veterans' Affairs in June/July 1984 and one by the Department of Social Security from October 1984 to April 1985. In both campaigns assistance was given by the Information Co-ordination Branch.
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) (a) and (b) There have been three information campaigns covering changes to the Electoral Act-one in November 1983 on new voting requirements for British subjects; one in October 1984 on changes to electoral boundaries, and one in November/December 1984 on new voting procedures for the 1984 Federal election.
      </para>
      <para>
       In all three campaigns the Australian Electoral Commission was the responsible Government agency and was assisted by the Information Co-ordination Branch. In the November 1983 campaign on new voting requirements for British subjects advertising assistance was provided by the Australian Government Advertising Service. In the two later campaigns the advertising assistance was provided by the Information Co-ordination Branch which, from 1 March 1984, incorporated the Australian Government Advertising Service.

       (3) (a) and (b) Assets Test-Department of Social Security. Press and radio advertising were used. The press advertising was arranged through the master agency for placing non-campaign press advertising, Gordon and Gotch, at a cost of $7,496.00. The radio advertising was arranged through the master agency for radio, television and cinema, Monahan Dayman Adams, at a cost of $280.00.
      </para>
      <para>
       Assets Test-Department of Veterans' Affairs. Press advertising was used. It was arranged and placed before the revised advertising system came into operation on 1 October 1984. The agency that handled the placement of the advertising was Neville Jeffress. It is not possible to calculate the amount paid to the agency for the specific campaign under the old system.

      </para>
      <para>
       Several advertising agencies were involved in providing placing/charging services for the three campaigns. Prior to 1 October 1984 these services for campaign advertising for press were provided by Doyle Dane Bernbach and for radio, television and cinema by The Weston Company. Since 1 October 1984, USP Needham has provided the placing/charging services for press and Monahan Dayman Adams (N.S.W.) for radio, television and cinema.
      </para>
      <para>
       In regard to the November 1983 campaign on new voting requirements for British subjects it is not possible to calculate under the old system the amount paid for placing/charging services for the campaign. The other two campaigns-changes to electoral boundaries and new voting procedures for the 1984 Federal election-occurred after the revised system came into force on 1 October 1989. The new system does not provide precise figures for placing/charging services for these two specific campaigns. However, it is possible to estimate that USP Needham received about $36,700 and Monahan Dayman Adams (N.S.W.) about $18,600.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) (a) The most recent information received by my Department is that nine shires in Queensland have been fully or partially drought declared.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is understood that individual properties are also declared but the number is not readily available.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The deteriorating rainfall situation in New South Wales and Queensland could affect the planting of winter cereal crops. I am advised that rain is required in some areas of northern New South Wales and southern Queensland to allow planting of the wheat crop to get underway.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) There has been a marginal fall in cattle prices at sales in Queensland in the last 4 months. I am advised that the index of cattle prices prepared by the Queensland Livestock and Meat Authority has fallen from 13.4 at the beginning of January 1985 to 128.2 at the beginning of May 1985.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The question of assistance for primary producers in drought declared areas is, in the first instance, the responsibility of the States. Under the Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements (NDRA), the Commonwealth automatically assists States with expenditure on natural disaster relief measures once this expenditure reaches an annual base level. Assistance is available in respect of approved 'core' and 'special measures'. Expenditure incurred by a State on agreed eligible core measures is automatically eligible for financial assistance under the arrangements.
      </para>
      <para>
       A State may also request the Commonwealth's agreement to special measures it may wish to implement because of particular needs arising from a disaster.
      </para>
      <para>
       Changes to the NDRA which came into effect in 1984-85 were the first since 1978-79 and were made largely to take account of the effects of inflation over the period. They were designed to result in a more equitable sharing of costs between the Commonwealth and States and Northern Territory (N.T.). Because of inflation, the shares for the Commonwealth and each of the States and N.T. resulting from the application of the 1978-79 formula were around 60 : 40 respectively in 1983-84.
      </para>
      <para>
       Base levels of expenditure by the States before the Commonwealth contribution under the revised NDRA are now set by reference to the size of State and N.T. Budgets. The base level is now set at 0.24 per cent of State Budget Sector Receipts (SBSR) two year earlier, which is the latest period for which relevant data is available. This will reflect that States' capacity to fund disaster refief and will ensure that the base levels are not eroded.
      </para>
      <para>
       Further changes to the cost sharing for Commonwealth and States and N.T. above the 0.24 per cent SBSR base level will apply from 1 July 1985.
      </para>
      <para>
       Detailed discussions on NDRA have been undertaken between Commonwealth and State and Northern Territory officials. The Government is also examining the feasibility of providing drought concessional loans through a separate funding mechanism. However, this examination has not yet reached finality.

In cases where pensioners owned real estate (other than the home) and the total value of their assets would have led to reduction in pension; or where the total value was within $20,000 of the allowable limit; or where the departmental officer was not satisfied with the pensioner's estimate, the real estate values were checked by officers of the Valuations Branch of the Australian Taxation Office.

      <para>
       (1), (2) and (5) Following the establishment of the Companies and Securities Law Review Comittee (CSLRC) in January 1984, the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities asked it to inquire into, and review, the use of the corporate form. This reference required the CSLRC to have particular regard to a number of matters, including:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) issues relating to proprietary companies-
      </para>
      <para>
       whether the existing classification of proprietary companies is appropriate and, if so, whether there should be any criteria for the incorporation of proprietary companies in Australia;
      </para>
      <para>
       the suitability of the provisions of the Companies Act 1981 in relation to the regulation of proprietary companies;
      </para>
      <para>
       the obligations of proprietary companies to make public disclosure, particularly in the light of their limited liability; and
      </para>
      <para>
       the desirability of abolishing the distinction between exempt and non-exempt proprietary companies; and
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) the various forms of company organization and incorporation of business that should be made available to intending entrepreneurs.
      </para>
      <para>
       During the second half of 1984 the CSLRC released for public comment a discussion paper in which it proposed that there should be new legislative provisions for the formation of 'incorporated partnership companies'. The proposed features of such companies include:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) limited liability for members;
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) absence of any legal duty to have accounts audited or to lodge accounts on a public register;
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) abolition of distinction between proprietors and directors;
      </para>
      <para>
       (iv) regulation of internal relations by rules appropriate to partnerships; and
      </para>
      <para>
       (v) minimisation of other administrative requirements.
      </para>
      <para>
       The CSLRC is currently preparing a report to the Ministerial Council about forms of legal organisation for small business enterprises in the light of submissions received on its discussion paper. Consideration of the CSLRC's report is expected to be given a high priority following its receipt by the Ministerial Council.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) On 8 May 1985, amendments to the companies legislation designed to facilitate the introduction of a new 'short-form' of annual return were introduced into the Commonwealth Parliament. With the introduction of this new form of annual return, exempt proprietary companies that do not have their accounts audited will only have to disclose selected items of financial information in their annual returns instead of having to attach their full accounts as at present.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The number of staff employed on 'registration-type' functions in each State Corporate Affairs Office is a matter within the responsibility of the Attorney-General in that State. However, in 1983 a review of staff employed in the A.C.T. and State Corporate Affairs Office showed that about 47 per cent of staff were engaged on 'registration-type' functions: the precise nature of the functions undertaken by these staff varied from State to State and, in a number of instances, included matters outside the scope of the co-operative companies and securities scheme (for example associations, business names and co-operative socieities).

       If any initiative such as that proposed seemed likely to gain support from the parties directly involved, including the Lebanese Government, it would deserve serious consideration.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia is not a party principal to efforts to promote a solution to the problems of Lebanon. It approaches the question, however, in a spirit of concern and goodwill, and with a willingness to contribute to the greatest extent possible towards the objective of securing peace and reconciliation.
      </para>
      <para>
       To this end Australia, through its Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York and Ambassador to Lebanon, has maintained an active interest in the search for a solution to the tragic events in Lebanon. Earlier this month our Permanent Representative in New York held discussions with his Lebanese counterpart as well as with a senior member of the United Nations Secretariat, to explore the scope for action in the Security Council. At the same time the Ambassador in Lebanon called on the Secretary-General of the Lebanese Foreign Ministry.
      </para>
      <para>
       These discussions indicated that the Lebanese Government would not favour action in the Security Council until Israeli forces had completed their withdrawal from Lebanese territory. It was expected that the Security Council might then consider the situation. Australia would support such consideration and would participate actively in it.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is considerable concern in the United Nations about the continued violence in Lebanon and the tragic loss of life. On 22 May the Secretary-General issued a statement expressing his deep concern and appealed to the Lebanese Government and to all concerned to make every possible effort to put an end to violence and to recognise the vital necessity for a determined move towards conciliation. Our Permanent Representative in New York is shortly to call on the Secretary-General of the United Nations to discuss the scope for action in the Security Council and/or by the Secretary-General to promote the cause of peace in that country.

       (a) In accordance with the emphasis on pensioner self-assessment, wherever possible the pensioners' estimates of the value of their assets were accepted. Some checking was required for certain items, for example, the value of shares was checked against current share listings in the financial Press. In cases where pensioners owned real estate (other than the home) and the total value of their assets would have led to reduction in pension; or where the total value was within $20,000 of the allowable limit; or where the departmental officer was not satisfied with the pensioner's estimate, the real estate values were checked by officers of the Valuations Branch of the Australian Taxation Office.

       (b) USSR-Estimated Outlays on Defence
      </para>
      <para>
       It should be stressed that estimates of defence expenditure for the Soviet Union are surrounded by considerable uncertainty, particularly in the most recent years.
      </para>
      <para>
       All authorities, both academic and governmental, which have sought to make estimates readily acknowledge that there are difficulties in attempting to compare figures for the USA and the Soviet Union, in view of Soviet secrecy and the substantial differences between the economic and military systems of the two countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       No single, definite figure for Soviet defence expenditure is available. The published soviet Defence Budget-about 17 billion roubles for each of the years between 1978 and 1983 (and for many years before that)-is believed to exclude a number of elements such as military research and development, stockpiling and civil defence. W. T. Lee, an academic specialising in this area, even argues that the official Soviet Defence Budget covers only the operating and military construction costs of the Soviet armed forces. Furthermore, Soviet pricing principles are very different from those applied in Western countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       Consequently, a sample of different estimates of Soviet defence expenditure for the period 1978 to 1983 (latest data available), both in roubles and United States dollars, is given in the table below, together with the official Soviet figures. Sources used include published official studies from the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the United States Department of Defence (DOD), the British Government and researchers quoted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, as well as the statistics presented officially by the Soviet Union.

The program has been designed to assist the business community to understand the implications of the Agreement and particularly to take advantage of the expanded trade opportunities. Activities have included seminars, publicity, an expanded trade promotion program and increased level of contact with exporters. The high level of enquiries at regional offices of my Department and trade commissioner posts in New Zealand as well as the sharp increase in exports to New Zealand would indicate that the program has been successful.

      <para>
       The previous government, which negotiated the Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, was aware of plans approved in 1981 by the previous New Zealand Government for expanding New Zealand steel production. While New Zealand's steel capacity will be more than sufficient to meet that country's needs for many products there will still be certain products which they will not be producing. Under the Trade Agreement trade liberalisation in respect of certain steel and steel products was temporarily deferred to enable the two governments to agree to liberalisation arrangements in the context of a harmonious development of the steel industry in each country.
      </para>
      <para>
       The present Government has ensured that the New Zealand Government is aware of the importance which Australia places on the development of equitable arrangements on steel under the Trade Agreement. This concern has been conveyed by the Prime Minister to Mr Lange, and by me to appropriate New Zealand Ministers.
      </para>
      <para>
       The present New Zealand Government has been reviewing the steel expansion program. However, it is expected that negotiations will resume in the near future to finalise liberalisation arrangements in accordance with the Agreement's requirements that trans-Tasman trade in steel and steel products will become free of tariffs and quantitative import restrictions in both directions.

       The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) Current instructions for the handling of Ministerial representations in my Department are provided within a document entitled 'Ministerial Correspondence Procedures', which was issued in August 1984. Certain details of these procedures have been amended by subsequent instructions, issued in Minute form. The normal 'target' period within which Ministerial correspondence should be responded to is 28 days from receipt within the Department, as specified in the above document. In respect of certain items of Ministerial correspondence of particular importance and urgency, a target period of 7-14 days applies.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) My Department's performance in handling Ministerial correspondence is monitored on a fortnightly basis, to identify input and output flows and those items which are overdue. The computerised recording system currently used in the Department does not provide statistical information in the manner sought by the honourable member. However a random check has shown that approximately 26 per cent of all Ministerial correspondence was responded to within the target period in 1985, to 16 May. For those items of Ministerial correspondence seen as particularly important and urgent, the figure over the same period was 86 per cent.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       1. A total of $1.012m has been provided through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA) to ATCI since late in 1978, as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       1978/79, $100,000; 1979/80, $140,000; 1980/81, $142,000; 1981/82, $166,000; 1982/83, $250,000; (includes one-off $72,000 equipment grant); 1983/84, $214,000 (124,000 was actually released on 31 July 1984, i.e. in 1984/85 financial year).
      </para>
      <para>
       From late in 1982, the ATCI had been funded under the so-called 'Wilson agreement'. This was agreed by the then Minister, the honourable member for Sturt, in September 1982 and offered core or administrative funding for the ATCI for the next three years. This provided salaries for staff and other management/administrative costs allowing the ATCI to organise and offer its courses without the need to charge general administrative costs against its clients. At the time the agreement was made, it was intended to allow the ATCI to work towards its stated objectives of achieving financial independence from DAA.
      </para>
      <para>
       The ATCI was originally funded to provide Community Management Training (CMT) in Northern Territory Aboriginal communities.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       A release due in November 1982 was not made until December 1982 because ATCI did not formally accept the 'Wilson agreement' until 30 November (although the offer was formally made on 28 September).
      </para>
      <para>
       Funding for the last two quarters of 1983/84 was not released until 31 July 1984. The delay was related to the events leading to my decision to change the funding arrangements.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. No. It is understood that the ATCI has been in receipt of significant sums from other sources additional to moneys provided through DAA.
      </para>
      <para>
       4. The ATCI claims to provide non-formal education/training in a workshop mode. From information which the ATCI has provided, however, it has become clear that not all the workshops it claims to have conducted have been of a training nature. Some of its listed workshops included meetings to discuss particular issues, for which the ATCI was engaged to organise and provide support, for example, conferences/workshops to discuss multi-cul- tural education and Aboriginal independent schools.
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Given the qualifications mentioned above, the ATCI claims to have conducted the workshops as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       1978, 1 workshop, 8 days duration
      </para>
      <para>
       1979, 26 workshop, 113 days duration;
      </para>
      <para>
       1980, 18 workshop, 103 days duration;
      </para>
      <para>
       1981, 18 workshop, 115 days duration;
      </para>
      <para>
       1982, 7 workshop, 52 days duration;
      </para>
      <para>
       1983, 11 workshop, 51 days duration.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is a total of 81 workshops over 442 days, from 1978 to 1983.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Based on DAA funding alone the average cost per workshop is $12,497 but, as indicated in my response to question No. 3, the ATCI has received funding from other sources.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) It is not possible, on the information provided by the ATCI, to provide details of the number of course participants. Earlier this year the ATCI stated that over 2,500 people had participated in its workshops. In December 1982, however, Ms Valadian, a Director of the ATCI, told the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs that 'we would have had close to 3,000 people that we have worked with over the last four years'.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) No. The ATCI has advised that not all courses have been for Aboriginals.
      </para>
      <para>
       5. The ATCI claims that its style of non-formal education cannot be assessed against normal education criteria and has never provided details of the outcomes of its courses. At a meeting in February 1985, I specifically asked if the ATCI reported back to communities and, if so, could I have copies of the documents. The information has not been provided.
      </para>
      <para>
       6. The paucity and inconsistency of information provided by the ATCI has always made a valid assessment difficult and an analysis of the evaluations therefore provides results more of the nature of 'not proved' one way or the other. For example, the 1981 review of the CMT program included comments by some course participants who expressed their wish that the courses should be conducted in their own communities (rather than at the Institute in Sydney) and that there should be more follow-up work to assist the course participants utilise the knowledge they had gained in their communities.
      </para>
      <para>
       7. In considering the funding of the ATCI, or any other Aboriginal organisations, the Department, in making its recommendations to me, assesses all claims against other competing demands and the availability of funds.
      </para>
      <para>
       8. Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Many reasons were involved, some of which have been alluded to in answers to preceding questions. When I became Minister in March 1983 I met Ms Valadian and Ms McNamara in Canberra and visited the Institute six months later in September 1983. On both occasions there were no courses being conducted by the ATCI. This concerned me greatly as the ATCI had been receiving regular funding releases for the entire year and Ms Valadian and Ms McNamara were funded by my Department on a full time basis to conduct training courses for Aboriginals. The information the ATCI subsequently provided about its courses during the year did not completely allay my concern.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) I asked the ATCI to submit proposals for specific course funding which would be considered in the normal way against competing priorities and the availability of funds.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The Chairman of the ATCI, Professor Philp, accepted my proposals in a conversation on 6 June 1984 and said that the ATCI would 'do some sums'. My senior private Secretary confirmed that conversation in a letter to Professor Philp on 19 June 1984.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) The ATCI has since failed to provide proposals with sufficient detail to allow assessment or decision. On 24 May 1984 Ms Valadian provided brief one and two line descriptions of a number of proposals but this was totally inadequate for me to make a decision to fund. Some further information was provided by the ATCI on 12 April 1985, almost eleven months later, but I have again had to ask the ATCI for more details, e.g. number of participants in proposed courses, location of courses, details of costing. This is despite the fact that these requirements were made clear in my letter of 14 February 1985. I wrote again to Ms Valadian on 18 April 1985 and reiterated my funding offer for specific courses.
