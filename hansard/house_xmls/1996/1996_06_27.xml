        The Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill amends the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992—the principal act. The primary purpose of the bill is to amend the principal act to remove certain restrictions on the restructuring of ownership of projects eligible for the development allowance so that a more consistent approach is available to the various types of prospective applicants for the development allowance. Where all other criteria in the principal act are met, these amendments would allow the transfer of the development allowance benefit where ownership of a project is transferred to another entity after application for the development allowance but before registration.

         Further, the amendments would allow the transfer of the development allowance benefit where ownership of a project is transferred from one entity structure to another type of entity structure after application for the development allowance. To maximise the effectiveness of the amendments, they will be retrospective and will apply from 1 January 1993, which is the date applications for the development allowance close. The amendments will also provide that any applications for registration of plant expenditure that were refused, or granted in respect of an amount of expenditure that was less than the amount of expenditure whose registration was sought in the application, may be granted in full if they would have been granted in full if the amend ments proposed in the bill had been in force when the principal act received royal assent.

        Moreover, the amendments will provide that any application for registration of plant expenditure that was withdrawn may be taken not to have been withdrawn if an application for transfer of the benefits of the application for registration could have been made if the amendments proposed in this bill had been in force when the principal act received royal assent. The amendments will also grant the Development Allowance Authority a power to determine that an application by an entity for registration of plant expenditure has lapsed in certain limited circumstances. The opportunity is also taken to make some minor administrative adjustments and to correct certain apparent drafting errors.

        This bill has no budgetary implications, as the revenue implications of the proposed amendments were previously incorporated into the budget estimates. The benefits of the amendments, in terms of revenue forgone, to projects which qualify for the allowance under the provisions of the bill is expected to be approximately $10 million per annum. Over the nine years from 1993-94 to 2001&amp;hyphen;02, the benefit to projects is expected to be approximately $92 million. This benefit relates only to unregistered projects that have already restructured or have developed an intention to restructure before registration. There is no reliable estimate of the prospective benefit to projects of allowing all types of restructuring after registration, but the benefit is unlikely to be more than $3 million per annum.

        The explanatory memorandum takes account of amendments made by the Australian Democrats in the Senate to the bill as introduced. Those amendments exclude urban roads from eligibility for the infrastructure borrowings concession. The government does not accept the Democrat amendments made in the Senate. Those amendments were made in haste and were not well considered. This bill deals with the development allowance. The amendments moved in the Senate relate to an entirely different issue—infrastructure borrowings.

These projects include 18 in the mining industry; 10 in the tourism industry; six in electricity, gas and water; four in manufacturing; and three in transport and storage. The mining projects are primarily in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia.

        With one ill&amp;hyphen;considered act, the Senate has jeopardised not only the investment and employment opportunities for Australians but also the goodwill of the business community for the Australian parliament. In relation to infrastructure borrowings, the Senate amendments misunderstand the role of infrastructure borrowings in the development of infrastructure projects. Infrastructure borrowings serve only to remove a potential tax impediment to one possible financing option available to infrastructure developers. The decisions as to whether infrastructure projects proceed at all is largely a decision for other levels of government. The government will therefore be moving to have these amendments removed from this bill.

         On Monday, at a time when the Senate was due to debate amendments to the development allowance, the Treasurer announced in question time his own policy statement on the development allowance: the continuation of tax concessions for urban tollways. If he had waited just 24 hours—one day—this bill would have passed through each House unamended. If anyone is to blame as to the suggestion of a delay in these development projects, then the Treasurer should have a good look in the mirror, as should the member for Braddon, the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles).

         I have noticed the feigned outrage the government have demonstrated about this provision. If they are so upset and so outraged, where is the Treasurer this morning? Why has he sent a parliamentary secretary, who has no responsibility whatsoever for the development allowance or tax concessions, into the chamber for carriage of this legislation? If this government are so upset and so concerned about this piece of legislation, they should have the responsible minister in the chamber. It is a mark of their disrespect for this House of Representatives that the Commonwealth Treasurer is not here this morning. It is a mark of their abuse of parliamentary process that he was willing to make major policy statements in the House of Representatives while at the same time, in another place, this type of legislation was before the Senate chamber.

         This is the same type of mistiming and misjudgment which wrecked the Premiers Conference. It is the same type of arrogance and conceited behaviour which wrecked the first Premiers Conference under the Howard&amp;hyphen;Fischer government. The Treasurer is demonstrating himself to be a poor politician and a poor parliamentarian—and we all know he is a poor economist—because he has made these mistimed and misjudged exercises into legislation. Whenever he makes a mistimed announcement, he always finds someone else to blame: the premiers, the Democrats, the Labor Party or the Senate.

If he had waited 24 hours—just one day—without trying to abuse parliamentary process and standards, then certainly this legislation would have passed through both chambers absolutely unamended. He is always trying to find someone else to blame and on this matter I would suggest his only defence is the Downer defence—because he is foolish, he is innocent. That is what the Treasurer is trying to say on this matter, using the Downer defence. Because he is foolish, because he has made the mistimed announcement, he is innocent.

          The Labor Party is in a very happy position on this legislation because all the other parties and other interests are absolutely rushing to promote and legislate on our policy. First of all it was the Liberal Party reintroducing the Development Allowance Authority Amend ment Bill—this legislation that the former government introduced in September 1995. We are happy to support them on those provisions. They are rushing to legislate on the policy of the Australian Labor Party on the development allowance so we are happy to support the Liberal Party on those particular provisions.

         Then we had the Democrats following the Treasurer's foolish, clumsy and mistimed announcement about urban tollways. We had the Democrats move in the Senate to terminate the tax concessions on those urban tollways. They are announcing Labor Party policy from December 1995—announced by the members for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton) and Gellibrand (Mr Willis). We are happy to support the Democrats on their rush to introduce Labor Party policy into both houses of the Commonwealth parliament.

         We thank the Liberal Party for moving our legislation on the development allowance. We thank the Democrats for moving our policy on tax concessions on urban tollways. It just goes to demonstrate that it is always the Labor Party painting the masterpieces of Australian public policy. We leave it to the Liberals and Democrats to run off the prints and the imitations, and to introduce this kind of legislation in both houses of the parliament.

         We also defend the right of the Democrats to introduce this type of amendment. The Labor Party will be supporting their provisions in the House of Representatives; we will be attempting to vote down the government amendments that the parliamentary secretary has suggested to the House. This is what the parliament is all about. It is about legislative amendment: new ideas, new information, new policies being placed in the public arena. If the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) were half serious about his proposition that the parliament is supreme over the executive, then he too would support the Democrat amendment because, in light of the Treasurer's ill&amp;hyphen;timed, clumsy announcement, it is totally legitimate for the Senate to respond in kind.

How did the Liberal Party, including the members for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) and Braddon, then respond? They responded by tacking onto that airport privatisation legislation a provision about Sydney airport and reopening the east&amp;hyphen;west runway. They tacked on a provision that was not to do with the private leasing; it was to do with operational efficiency and safety of that airport. They have a record on this; they have a track record and form on this.

         They too, in opposition, were in the business of taking one piece of legislation and moving a related amendment in the other place. They held up that legislation and it was not passed at the dissolution of the last parliament. By the standards that the Prime Minister set, when he was in opposition, it is totally legitimate for the Democrats to respond to the Treasurer's announcement in this place and to move their amendment on the development allowance bill in the Senate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think it is very important for the House to understand this fundamental truth. The only way government policy on the tax concessions and the only way government policy on the urban tollways will change is if they change it. They are the policy makers and they have the whip hand on this particular matter. The Treasurer, in a press release issued on 24 June, said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Since the legislation to enact the decision of 15 December has not been introduced to parliament, the effect of today's announcement is that urban road projects have never been excluded from the infrastructure borrowings concession.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is, the legislation had not been introduced; the previous government was not able to legislate on its announcement. So the Treasurer has pointed out that these tax concessions on the urban tollways have never been taken away. The only way they can be removed is if the government supports those provisions in the House today and confirms the Democrat amendment that was moved in the Senate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So it is up to the government to decide whether or not it is willing to change its policy on tax concessions for urban toll roads.
         <break page="2962" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          The former government had not legislated on those provisions. If they want the development projects to proceed—the development projects which rely on these amendments to the development allowance—then they should support this bill and those provisions, as the Senate supported them. There is no legitimacy in the claim that development projects are being held up by the Senate amendment, because the Senate passed the changes to the development allowance. It is available to government members today to support those changes to the development allowance and give the green light to those development projects.

         It is interesting to note the hypocrisy of Senator Short aka Mr Williams in the other place. It is always interesting to note his hypocrisy on these matters, saying that it is the Labor Party and the Democrats who are holding up $2.5 billion worth of development projects because we are not allowing the easy passage of the development allowance. We are allowing the easy passage of the development allowance. But it is interesting to note that this is the same Senator Short who, back in June 1992, did not even support the development allowance. If Senator Short aka Mr Williams had had his way back in June 1992, these projects would not have even been considered; they would not have been on the drawing board of corporate Australia. Senator Short said in the other place on 17 June 1992:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I will very quickly outline again why we are opposed to the Development Allowance Authority Bill and the Pooled Development Funds Bill. The Development Allowance Authority Bill establishes a one&amp;hyphen;member statutory authority—the Development Allowance Authority, the DAA—which will have the task of assessing the eligibility of large projects with the capital cost of $50m or more. The basic objection that we have to this is that no earthly reason has been presented as to why we have to set up yet another quango to handle a matter such as this.
        </para>
        <para>
         So the double standards are stark; the hypocrisy is stunning. There is no reason for the senator to complain because he did not even support the development allowance. It was his policy, in 1992, to oppose the development allowance in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The government has been caught out on these matters. We are glad that
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          there has been a late conversion to Labor Party policy to reintroduce the legislation that we had before the House in September 1995, but we note the hypocrisy as they do so.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Further, I would suggest that the government and Senator Short are gilding the lily on these matters. They are suggesting that $2.5 million worth of development is being held up. They also state in the provisions of this bill that it provides an additional $10 million per annum in the development allowance. This is an extraordinary multiplier effect. The idea that there is $2.5 billion worth of investment being held up by just $10 million worth of tax concessions is a bit rich.

The member for Mitchell is not known for his prowess in economics, but even he would understand that it is a bit rich to say that $10 million worth of tax concessions multiplies into $2.5 billion worth of investment. That is a multiplier effect, according to Senator Short aka Mr Williams, of 250 times. Talk about feeding the multitudes. Talk about turning loaves and fishes into a feast. This is a ridiculous proposition. There is no way in the world that $2.5 billion worth of investment would be hanging off a tax concession of no more than $10 million of public money. There is no way in the world that you would get that sort of multiplier effect in the corporate balance sheets of the Australian nation.

          You should be concerned about the morality of a government which is talking about the reintroduction of university fees, cutting the guts out of the university sector in Australia. You should be concerned about a government which is talking about having a co-payment on Medicare and income testing the parenting allowance and asset testing blind age pensions. Asset testing blind age pensions! That came out of a leaked document from the Department of Finance and was revealed in the Senate just two days ago.

The opposition embraces the proposition that BOOT private infrastructure, funded by these types of tax concessions, is least beneficial for road and urban rail projects.

           There is therefore no strong `tax inefficiency' case for retaining infrastructure bonds, which indirectly provide a tax benefit to some private projects . . . the development of the capital markets largely removes the ongoing need for such a concession.

           The Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) has described the Commission of Audit report as a `road map'. What I say is that it should be a road map without tax concessions for tollways. He knows those things because he has been a Premier of New South Wales, and he was part of the bad public policy that led to the M5 tollway in the south&amp;hyphen;west of Sydney, the M4 tollway in Western Sydney and the impending construction of the M2 tollway in north&amp;hyphen;west Sydney. These things, of course, demonstrate that the construction of those tollways—through the eyes of state government—is nothing more than a cost shifting exercise. It is a cost shifting exercise whereby governments would like to build these roads but, for short&amp;hyphen;term budgetary reasons, they seek to push the cost of them onto user&amp;hyphen;payers—the people who can pay the toll.

           Paying the toll, of course, hurts low&amp;hyphen;income earners who cannot afford that regressive road tax. It hurts small business—the sort of small business the government says it supports. There are all those courier operations up and down the tollways, paying the regressive road tax. Their business aspirations and profitability are severely damaged by these types of roads and the type of cost shifting exercise that state governments have engaged in. Beyond that, these tollways represent secret deals. That is why they are bad public policy. There is no accountability and no transparency. So much for a Charter of Budget Honesty when we never get to see the funny money deals that are made by way of secret contract on these tollways. The contracts are kept secret—they are hidden behind an argument of commercial confidence. The tax arrangements between the Taxation Office and each of the tollway companies are also kept secret—they are also hidden behind confidentiality reasons.

            these tax concessions. As the deals are negotiated it is no secret that the tollway companies hold all the aces. The public sector is not suited to this type of negotiation. The companies always know more about the finance risk than government negotiators do. They always know more about the rate of return than government negotiators do. As governments become desperate to shift their costs to private users of the road—off to user&amp;hyphen;pays arrangements—the negotiations favour the companies.

           Due to the financial mismanagement of the Greiner and Fahey governments in New South Wales, we have ended up by handing over to private tollway companies a licence to print money. You handed over a licence to print money to those tollway companies. These tax concessions end up—this is recognised by EPAC and the National Commission of Audit—as nothing more than an unnecessary subsidisation of private profit. These tax concessions prop up arrangements arrived at by state government where they hand over a licence to print money. Those companies running the M4 and the M5 in Sydney—and soon the City Link project in Melbourne and the M2 in the north&amp;hyphen;west of Sydney, through the electorate of Mitchell—have a licence to print money.

           The payment of these tax concessions is obscene. The payment of these tax concessions is immoral.

As we talk now about the eastern distributor project in Sydney and the extension of the M5 east towards Tempe, we are talking about the possibility of federal subsidies, in the form of tax concessions, of $75 million: $75 million paid in federal subsidies to companies which already have a licence to print money. That is obscene and immoral.

           Beyond that, these urban tollway projects represent bad urban planning because they rely on the funnelling of traffic onto the tollway: funnel the traffic onto the tollway, collect the tolls and continue that licence to print money by the private tollway operators. Those citizens who cannot afford the toll end up using all the side streets and all the urban

It is a triple whammy caused by these tax concessions. People pay their own taxes, which should fund the construction of public roads; they are funding the $75 million tax concession that the government is trying to push through the parliament; and they then have to pay a toll. So it is a triple whammy on standards of living. These projects are to be denounced as immoral and improper. They are bad public policy, they are bad urban planning, and there is no way in the world the Labor Party will be supporting the continuation of these tax concessions. We will be insisting on their removal here in the House and then in the Senate.

But following an election you think you have the opportunity to come in here say in relation to the announced policies that the people decided on 14 weeks ago, `We have a right to block anything, whether announced or not announced.' That shows the degree of cynicism of the Australian Labor Party joining with the Greens and the Democrats in the Senate to block anything at whim. It would appear that you are stamping out new ground for future governments.

Those cities are car based, they are vehicular traffic based, and there is no way you are going to change that.

         —It is somewhat difficult to respond to the submission made to this place by the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), given that he has made indeed only passing and perhaps cursory reference to the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1996 currently before the House. The purpose of the Development Allowance Authority Bill 1992 was basically to allow project restructurings to become eligible for the 10 per cent deduction allowance for plant expenditure. The Development Allowance Authority Act 1992 established the Development Allowance Authority, vesting in it the power to provide development allowance to projects with gross capital costs of $50 million or more.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The development allowance is a deduction equal to some 10 per cent of eligible plant expenditure and was initiated to promote investment in both new plant and new equipment. The amendments contained in the bill currently before the House remove restrictions that apply to projects that are ineligible for the allowance because ownership has been transferred after the application for the allowance but before registration. For example, in cases where the authority accepts that the restructuring of a project was bona fide, the bill will enable it to be eligible for the allowance—and this will apply retrospectively from 1 January 1993.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government's cynicism and, indeed, opportunism was displayed when they were in opposition. It is once again revealed by their stance on this bill compared with the stance they took in regard to the principal act. When the Development Allowance Authority Bill 1992 was introduced into the Senate, the opposition opposed the establishment of the authority.
       </para>

        They did not oppose the Development Allowance Authority Bill 1992 on some mere grounds of parliamentary technicality or procedure, nor were they content to suggest any form of amendment—any form at all—that might in some way improve the bill. They simply voted flatly against the bill. No amendments, no particular input—a simple flat vote against it. As the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has submitted to this

       <para first-indent="16">
        The member for Werriwa has also taken the time and trouble to quote remarks made in 1992 by the now Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short). The present Assistant Treasurer's submission to the Senate in June 1992 states:

       <para>
        It was a fairly derisive and cursory passing off of the all important legislation that was before him. Indeed, it is perhaps not surprising that the now Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short, the minister responsible for guiding the bill's proposed amendments through the Senate, had, as I say, nothing whatsoever of any substance, level of thought or intelligence to contribute on the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1996. One only wonders how and why that could possibly be. Indeed, the only comments the Assistant Treasurer made in the Senate on the measures contained within the bill were in response to a question without notice from the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot). The information he provided on that occasion was what perhaps might best be described as a misleading and fanciful account of the impact of the measures passed by the Senate and supported by the opposition.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So even though back in June 1992 as a member of the then opposition he did not support the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill, he and his party now in government have the audacity and perhaps even the temerity to claim that the opposition is holding up $2.5 million worth of developments with its amendments to this bill. As I say, this is an act of extreme hypocrisy and overwhelming double standard.

        In my view, honourable members should cast their minds back to the then opposition's approach to so many government proposals to lift the level of investment in Australia—something which I know both sides of the House agree needs to be done. But at that time the former opposition, the new government, not only opposed the Development

         Allowance Authority Amendment Bill—a bill designed to facilitate the application of new investment for plant and equipment in construction and other projects around the Australian economy—but also opposed the Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill.

        The then opposition went on to berate the then government's labour market programs and was genuinely contemptuous of government assistance to industry that could provide an early upturn in investment to the benefit of our competitiveness in world markets. By and large, across the board the assistance provided by the Development Allowance Authority through the provision of this 10 per cent deduction was, in the view of the then government, the now opposition, extremely well targeted.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">

        Honourable members will note that this bill is essentially the same as that which was introduced into this House on 27 September last year but which subsequently lapsed when the parliament was dissolved due to the intervention of the 1996 federal election. However, the now government's hypocrisy and double standards come into stark play when, specifically, it comes to questions of industry assistance and investment, as I have just mentioned. Both of these things—industry assistance and investment promotion—are not just a function of the expediencies of opposition colliding with the realities of government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is clear that the government, the former opposition, has no coordinator strategy for dealing with investment promotion. Yet, as I say, it berated the then government whilst simultaneously opposing that government's initiatives when there was an attempt to introduce legislation such as the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill back in 1992 and, indeed, as I reiterate, the Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill.

        Without pursuing or dwelling unnecessarily on these matters, it is clear that the government has absolutely no vision for the manner in which it can best both facilitate and assist industry investment in worthwhile projects that benefit Australia or Australian companies in their pursuit of overseas operations and the gaining of tenders and contracts in overseas projects.

        We now know well, following the submission made to the House a few moments ago by the member for Werriwa, that the Treasurer's mistimed and misjudged announcements in this regard have cost both the parliament and the country significantly as there is no doubt that, had he waited but one more day, a further 24 hours, this bill would have passed both houses of parliament unamended. It is no secret that the ALP supports the Democrats' amendments and opposes those that have been put by the government.

        It is true that no-one can really responsibly support all measures that purport to be industry assistance.

That is why the opposition supports the amendment

        We do so because, primarily, it is bad public policy. In fact, it might best also be described as immoral public policy because we now well know that it is the government's intention in the budget on 20 August this year to deliver some $8 billion worth of budget cuts while simultaneously providing tax concessions to companies like the Transurbans of this world. Transurban is responsible for the construction of the City Link project in my state of Victoria which will cause many Victorians, notably constituents in Cranbourne, a suburb of the electorate of Isaacs that I represent, significant  financial hardship.

        The electorate of Isaacs does contain a major growth area, Cranbourne, which is primarily dependent on the south&amp;hyphen;eastern freeway for its road linkage to the central Melbourne CBD and beyond via the Tullamarine freeway to the airport and suburbs west.

        The tollways deal is a licence to print money for Transurban. According to Transurban CEO, Kim Edwards, the consortium's debt will be paid off after the first 13 years of the contract. This means that for the next 21 years Transurban will reap a benefit of $200 million a year in revenue from the tolls—a total income of more than some $4 billion. Investors in City Link will be given an extraordinary 19 per cent return. This is the equivalent of a pre-tax profit of some 32 per cent.

        A person of the age of 32 in the year 2000 will still be paying tolls when they retire at age 65. They will spend the rest of their working life paying road tolls.

        EPAC has warned against private and unfunded roads on the basis that private risk makes the roads more expensive to both build and finance.

        Victoria does have an alternative to City Link. It is called Melbourne Access 2000, which will provide the necessary road links without tolls and without debt.

The Victorian government has agreed to create traffic jams on major arterial roads to force cars onto these City Link freeways, and it would have to compensate Transurban if these measures were removed.

        The Victorian government's contract with Transurban also specifies that compensation will be payable if a rapid transit link from the city to Tullamarine airport, so strongly supported by many Melburnians, is constructed and if the measures that I have just mentioned in terms of protecting Transurban are removed. The City Link freeway will create traffic jams on the adjoining roads that feed on to the City Link freeway and commuters will be forced to pay tolls which they may otherwise try to avoid by taking alternative routes around the particular Transurban built City Link project.

        In conclusion, it is clear from the example provided to us by the Victorian government's foray into privately funded road development projects that the universal application of the development allowance to all large-scale infrastructure investments is not in the best interests of Australians and is not an appropriate usage of the nation's scarce fiscal resources. On this basis, I commend the bill, as amended, to the House.

        By way of background, I might make a couple of points about the establishment of the Development Allowance Authority and make some comments about how the government has come at this matter and how silly the situation is that the government now finds itself in. It really stems from the fact that Australia did have—and I use the terms `did have'—a major savings problem in the economy in that most Australians traditionally put their savings in the form of bricks and mortar.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        You hear economists and other people say that we as a nation are terrible savers. That is not so. Australians are quite prolific savers, but they prefer to do it in the form of their house and land. They put aside quite large portions of their weekly pay to save up and pay off their house over their working life. The problem, though, that has caused in our economy is that they are left with very little spare cash to invest in our own ideas, inventions and national development.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So it has been left either to government to raise taxes and pay for projects—be they infrastructure, power generation, building schools and universities—or to organisations like the CSIRO to fund research and development in the nation because we did not have an ethic of investment in R&amp;D in Australia and we did not have an ethic of investment in our own ideas and inventions. That is why there is a list as long as your arm of Australian ideas and inventions that have been taken overseas and of profits earned by others who have invested very successfully in us.

        That came to be understood by the former Labor government and the ACTU when we worked through the accord process for the introduction of superannuation for the whole work force in the Australian economy.

By comparison, our superannuation funds, now at $230 billion, whether you think that amount of money is an apple or a watermelon, are already bigger than the whole net foreign debt. The challenge for Australia, now that Labor has put this capital base in place, is not one of paying off the debt. It is one of ensuring that this new savings base that we have driven into the economy is used for productive investment in the Australian economy, for buying back the farm from all the overseas investors who have provided us with capital in the past and for making sure that our own repayments go back into our own funds.

The only reason they are out there discounting home loans is that as part of the deal of creating superannuation funds they would start providing cheaper home loans for Australians and members. So they have taken hundreds of millions of dollars, invested them in organisations like Aussie Home Loans and said, `Go out there and win some of the home loans for our markets.' That is what has happened.

        One of the areas where we decided we wanted to see the funds invest was public infrastructure. We created a vehicle called an infrastructure bond so that a superannuation fund could invest in public infrastructure and receive the same return for the members that it would get if it invested in a normal private sector investment. We gave the superannuation funds that return by giving them a special tax deal—a discounted tax rate for investment in infrastructure bonds.

        We also decided that this should not be a thing for Ralph Willis as Treasurer, or Bob Hawke or Paul Keating as Prime Minister, or me as a humble parliamentary secretary, to make judgments about what investments should be supported and what should not. We would establish the Development Allowance Authority as an arms&amp;hyphen;length body to make judgments and to issue the bonds. That is what happened. Once the capital markets started to understand that this new and attractive investment vehicle was there, they started to look at public sector investment projects, such as power, rail and roads, and they started to develop the projects and seek approval under the Development Allowance Authority.

Many of us still feel that the authority could have taken a different decision, but it did not and the project went ahead. In that process, EPAC, in particular, looked at this issue of whether roads constitute a sensible form of private sector investment. Should roads, through the tax system, be given a special deal or is it simpler for governments or councils or state governments to simply raise taxes and build roads themselves and not have tollways? If private sector investment builds a road, you have to have tollways to repay the investment or, alternatively, governments have to make a payment to them because they have to get a return on the investment.

        After doing all the analysis, EPAC and Treasury, as I remember, demonstrated to us as a government that it was more efficient in the economy for the government simply to raise taxes and build the roads themselves and give people free use of roads. That is why we deleted roads from the coverage area of these infrastructure bonds. There were two reasons for that. Firstly, there was a very strong case that it was better for government to do it. The second reason was the rorting and tricked up structure of City Link in Melbourne.

        Let me tell honourable members a little about this tricked up structure. There are very clear definitions in our Development Allowance Authority regulations and guidelines of what constitutes proper investment behaviour.

        When you establish the new City Link tollway in Melbourne, what choice has Jeff Kennett left for motorists to choose to use the tollway and pay the toll or go in some other way?

That was an anti&amp;hyphen;competitive measure that, in my view, was absolutely contrary to the spirit of our Development Allowance Authority regulation, and the authority, in my view, should have found as such.

        Then we came to the issue of the fast train from the airport. There is a very strong view around the world in most sensibly planned cities with a large airport and a lot of traffic to the airport that the smart thing to do is to have a high&amp;hyphen;speed rail link from the airport to the CBD. The latest major one that I have seen being established is at the new airport in Hong Kong, where one of the three rail options that they have built in is a high&amp;hyphen;speed rail link to the CBD. Everyone who is smart is doing it.

        Not only did Jeff Kennett in Victoria refuse to condone the concept of a very fast train or a rapid transit link from the airport to the city; he actually passed up an offer from the federal Labor government of $2 million worth of study to work out how we might do it best. Instead he is widening the Tullamarine Freeway and telling people that they are going to have to pay tolls to travel on a road that is already there and that they have already paid for. They are going to travel on it and pay tolls on it to pay for it in the future—and they are giving the drivers an extra lane to make them feel that they are getting something for their money. That is the sort of tricked&amp;hyphen;up stuff that was not consistent with what Labor intended with the legislation.

        The other sort of tricked&amp;hyphen;up stuff is the capital structure that has been set up for City Link. City Link was proposed to be a public investment and it was at all times talked about as a public float so that, once it was set up and you could see what the economics would be, the public would be invited to invest in it. Well, wasn't that a really wonderful show? What we found when the float came to the surface was that 12&amp;half; per cent of

         $1.2 billion was actually available to the public. The other 87.5 per cent has been taken by the private share owners and the overseas investors. And what is the guarantee? The guarantee is that the motorists will pay tolls for 32 years, the project will be fully paid for in the first 15 and the tolls will be paying profit to these 87&amp;half; per cent of the private investors in the $1.2 billion—the Jeff Kennett fund club—for the next 20 years after the show is paid for.

What they have set up is a rort to give the very rich in Melbourne a guaranteed bank payroll for 25 years, at the expense of the ordinary taxpayer, when these provisions were set up with decent intention to provide for our superannuation funds, in particular, to take a stake in public infrastructure like this.

There have certainly been some fairly wild statements made about the position of the opposition in regard to this matter. Let me make it clear at the outset that we absolutely support the original provisions in the bill that was sent to the Senate, which were meant to redress some shortcomings in the DAA legislation as it turned out over time, particularly where there were changes in company structures or changes of ownership which meant that companies that had made application for the development allowance would be ineligible unless the legislation were changed.

         Let there be no doubt about our position. This is not an attempt by us in any way to sabotage what we see as worthwhile legisla tion, which we, in fact, proposed in government but did not get through the parliament before the election. Contrary to what the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said yesterday, where he accused us of economic sabotage, our position is absolutely one of support for the changes to the act regarding the Development Allowance Authority to enable these companies which would otherwise be excluded from the development allowance to qualify.

        There is another issue which was brought into the ring by the Treasurer himself earlier this week, as has been mentioned by the speakers on this side of the House, when in question time he arranged to have a question from the government side and announced that he was going to reverse the policy announced by myself, as Treasurer, and the then Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton, last December, where we jointly announced a government decision to ensure that there would be no further use of infrastructure bonds for urban roads.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Contrary to what the Treasurer says—and he said in parliament that this was taken for factional reasons—there was no such element involved whatever. This was a considered decision by the government of the day in the light of what we saw as developing experience in relation to the use of infrastructure bonds and urban roads, and the private sector development of urban roads, which, of course, was facilitated by the infrastructure bonds. We were concerned that we may have gone too far in respect of providing the infrastructure bonds for this purpose.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course, there was a backing for that from the EPAC task force report on private sector infrastructure, which gave us an interim report in May of last year and a final report, I think, in October. The tenor of that report was fairly anti the whole notion of infrastructure bonds and recommended a review by 1997-98 and, generally, was fairly unsupportive of this additional incentive for private sector involvement in infrastructure.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The task force were particularly critical of the use of infrastructure bonds for urban roads. They did that on the basis that they saw both the transaction costs and the regulatory risks as being higher where private sector
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         capital was used to build this infrastructure than would be the case where there was the normal development of roads by way of public sector borrowings and contracting out of the actual construction arrangements.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In looking at that, they came up in their interim report in May of last year with various examples about the additional substantial costs of raising capital; the legal costs involved in putting together the financial arrangements; and the financial consultant costs, which were millions and millions of dollars. They generally found that this was a much more expensive business, in relation to the legal and financial costs for putting together the overall financial plan where private sector capital was involved, than was the case with the public sector.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They also found that there was considerable regulatory risk. In particular, they were pointing to the fact that operating a private sector road in a public sector network of roads does bring with it considerable diseconomies, and that those diseconomies come about because of the need to try to ensure to the private sector owners of the toll road that they are going to have sufficient traffic to ensure that the project is viable over a long period of years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These BOOT—build, own, operate, transfer—projects are relatively new in this country, but we have had some experience already. City Link, which has been mentioned by the previous speaker and others, is a very substantial example. Already we have seen with that substantial evidence of the kinds of circumstances which the EPAC task force had been pointing to; that is, the need to close off roads, for instance, to try to ensure that you funnel traffic into the toll road to make the project viable and to give some certainty of traffic to the proponents so that they will, in fact, finance the project.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That, of course, involves various diseconomies. It means that the rest of the road network is not being used to its fullest. It means that roads which are currently productively used have to be narrowed or closed off. We see this in relation to City Link in Melbourne, where various roads are proposed to be reduced in their operation to try to ensure that
        <break page="2977" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the City Link road can be a viable operation. Without that, the proponents would simply say, `We haven't got the certainty that this project is going to be viable and we won't finance it.' So there you have the absurdity of existing good roads, or reasonable roads anyway, being cut down to help finance a new road. That does not happen anywhere, to my knowledge, in relation to the provision of new public sector roads, but it is a feature of private sector urban road development.

        With the City Link project, Footscray Road, a major road that leads from the city to my electorate, is being downgraded to two lanes in each direction between the Flinders Street extension and Dudley Street. Boundary Road is being downgraded to one lane in each direction. Batman Avenue will be absolutely closed west of the Morell Bridge, and the bridge itself will be closed in Anderson Street. Alexandra Avenue will be downgraded to one lane in each direction, and so on. There is a whole series of road narrowings or closures around the centre of Melbourne, where the City Link project will be particularly concentrated around the Domain tunnel.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        All of this is happening to try to ensure that there is viability for a project which will mean that the people of Melbourne will have to pay substantial amounts of money to travel across areas which they can currently travel across for nothing. But, with the narrowing or closing of these other roads, they will not have alternatives. The traffic will be too heavy on these narrowed roads or there will be no road at all because it will be closed off. These sorts of network risks are clearly quite serious.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The EPAC report pointing to these deficiencies and the experience with City Link led us to the point of saying that we could not go back on what we had already put in place. We had originally decided that urban roads should qualify. They seemed to fit the general nature of infrastructure bonds and facilitating private sector investment and helping to get roads built that would not otherwise be built. But we never foresaw that we would have this absurdity of the closure of roads or the narrowing of roads and the restriction of the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         network that currently exists, resulting in a less efficient arrangement.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In those circumstances, we decided that the sensible thing to do was to take the decision that no more urban roads would qualify for infrastructure bonds. It was not an off&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen; cuff decision, it was not a factional decision; it was a considered decision on the basis of a theoretical report from a respected body, EPAC, and on the basis of the experience of the largest private sector road development project in the nation's history—City Link in Melbourne.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In light of that we believe it is absurd for the government to now try to overturn the decision which was made by cabinet and announced last December by me and the former Minister for Transport. It is ridiculous to go back on that. It is against the advice of the EPAC task force and it is against commonsense in relation to what we are seeing happen with City Link in Melbourne.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is not to say that we do not see a role for infrastructure bonds more generally. The EPAC task force makes the point that infrastructure bonds can still be used for roads where there is not that private sector competition or network. So there may be cases where it is still appropriate outside the urban area. That is a matter for consideration. Our decision was in relation only to urban roads; we did not foresee any further restriction of infrastructure bonds. As against our original introduction of infrastructure bonds, the areas of economic activity that qualified for infrastructure bonds had been considerably expanded by us subsequent to our original introduction of them in, I think, late 1992.

        I very much reject the government view that our decision was flippant, not thought through, and done for unsubstantial reasons.

We strongly believe that that is the appropriate course of action. It was the action that we announced in government. We are being consistent in pursuing that in opposition.

I think much of that history serves to set the record straight and indicates to the House that the previous government, having introduced this measure, changed its position concerning urban roads in the light of experience, a decision which was not taken lightly and which was taken to benefit the Australian public and is one which we are sticking to now in relation to this amendment.

It is not the purpose of roads to make profits for Macquarie Bank shareholders. This shows up

        Let us consider how the City Link project has functioned in practice. It has disadvantaged motorists, particularly those on the north side of Melbourne accustomed to using the Tullamarine Freeway—a freeway which runs, in part, through my electorate of Wills. Many thousands of motorists from the electorate of Wills have traditionally used the Tullamarine Freeway. They will now be expected to pay tolls, the severity of which depends on the extent and frequency of use of City Link. A figure of $20 a week in additional costs will be an average sort of figure.

        Of course, when you think about taxation matters and so on, any motorist who is being slugged an extra $20 a week, or close to $1,000 a year, has to earn quite a lot more to make up for that.

It is not like the Sydney Harbour Bridge, for example, where you can stick a toll on and there are not too many alterna tives.

        The other thing about City Link which needs to be understood is that it commits the government—whichever government it may be—in Victoria over the next 35 years to transport planning designed to make City Link profitable. There are clauses in the City Link project which commit the government to paying the Transurban consortium compensation if it does anything which adversely affects their revenue and the viability of the project.

        If the government, for example, wants to improve public transport in Melbourne, in particular in the northern suburbs—and there are a variety of projects which many of us would see as worth while: for example, extending the rail network, having a fast rail link out to the Tullamarine airport, and so on—and these projects are entered into, they may well trigger off, give rise to, claims for compensation by Transurban. So you have here a project which locks in all the transport planning for the next 30-odd years. So it is very bad planning, it is a very bad principle, to commit future governments in this way.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The project, as the member for Gellibrand pointed out, is a nonsense in the way it requires road closures and road reductions in order to funnel traffic onto the City Link and make the private road profitable. Because the public roads do not need to be profitable, traffic is to be discouraged from using them. The most celebrated example is the cutting down of Footscray Road from eight lanes to four.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In my area, the Tullamarine Freeway is to be widened from four lanes to eight. Motorists are being told, `You have to pay a toll on the freeway now because it is a new freeway and has been widened from four lanes to eight, and that is a great thing.' But Footscray Road is being narrowed from eight lanes to four, and the Minister for Roads in Victoria says, `Well, Footscray Road could become a
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         nice boulevard.' No doubt it could, but it is designed to serve a transport purpose. If you want to follow that logic through, Tullamarine Freeway could become a nice boulevard too and be cut in half. It is an absurd piece of road planning.

        It has become increasingly apparent that it is not so much a project to address the Tullamarine Freeway bottleneck, which all of us would like to see done, it is not so much a project to link the north side of Melbourne with the south side of Melbourne, but a project for the privatisation of Melbourne's road system. It starts with City Link, but once you have those electronic transponders put on the motor vehicles of ordinary motorists—indeed, it will be an offence to travel along the City Link, the Tullamarine Freeway, without one of those transponders installed—there will be no stopping this technology and it will be applied to other roads. The private investment in the City Link project has become de facto privatisation of our road system. I believe that Melbourne would be very much better off if projects of this kind were not privately funded but publicly funded.

        The Labor Party has opposed the City Link project. We do not believe that the decision of the Development Allowance Authority to support this project and give it that tax concessional treatment which comes from infrastructure bond status was a correct decision. We believe that the City Link project is anti&amp;hyphen;competitive and, therefore, does not meet the requirements of the original legislation, which set out that in order to have infrastructure bond status a project must not be anti-competitive. We believe that City Link closes off options for public transport, and indeed for other roads, and so does not meet those requirements. We appealed to the Development Allowance Authority for review. Having been unsuccessful at that stage, we have further appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I have been involved with and am supporting that appeal.

        <break page="2980" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the explanation given by the member for Gellibrand of that decision is entirely convincing. It was a decision not taken lightly. It was a decision taken in the face of experience, taken in the face of the recommendations of an EPAC report. What the government has come into this House with now flies in the face of the recommendations of that EPAC report.

        For those reasons, the House should support the position taken by the opposition. We have to look very carefully at where private investment in public infrastructure is leading us. It is allied to this concept of debt. Financial institutions have said to governments around the world, `We do not accept your having debt and we insist that debt no longer exist, and if you are going to engage in any projects we want them to be privately owned and privately financed.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That approach to debt often misunderstands the nature of public enterprises. For example, if a local council were required to build a swimming pool entirely funded from rates in any one year, the swimming pool would never be built. The rate base simply would not be large enough to support it. Nor would it be equitable to require the ratepayers to fund that project in that year, given that many of them may not use it, and many ratepayers further down the track would have the benefit of the facility, having made no contribution to it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is on that basis that councils borrow to build swimming pools. It is on that basis that governments borrow to finance capital investments and capital projects which are of value to the communities and which are paid off over time. The community has always gained great benefit from those projects.

         I do not accept the view of financial institutions that these things can no longer be done from the public purse. To go back to that original example, we should not be paying the shareholders of Macquarie Bank $36 million in order to finance a road project. If the road project is deemed to be worth while, it should be financed publicly and paid for through appropriate public financing mechanisms.

        The City Link example gives the House the opportunity to reconsider the impact of allowing infrastructure bond status to urban road projects. The total cost of City Link has been $1.7 billion. Of that, only $1.1 billion represents the construction cost. The other $600 million represents the cost of financing, fees and commissions—for those who are lucky enough to be inside the Victorian government. I believe that the City Link example shows this House and the people of Australia generally that we should no longer continue to finance such projects through infrastructure bonds. We should therefore support the position taken by the then government in December of last year and by the Democrats in the Senate.

         that the honourable member for Gellibrand had the opportunity in this debate to put so succinctly, from the angle of the decision makers, how the decision announced in that statement came about.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I wish to place on record my observations as an interested government backbencher at that time about the City Link project. I used my contribution to the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) last November to indicate my grave concerns about the City Link project. At that time I was asking the government to intervene. I concluded my contribution about City Link by saying:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I urge the Commonwealth government to think very carefully before becoming in any way involved in this fiasco.

       <para>
        I did not use those words lightly because I was concerned about the effect of the City Link project on the residents of especially the northern and western suburbs of Melbourne, which are part of the region that I represent. Of course, the City Link also has an effect—as the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) has indicated—on those who live in the south-east of Melbourne.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am a bit wiser about the mechanisms of the authority and understand that the honourable member for Gellibrand, as Treasurer, had been placed deliberately by the legislation at arm's length from the decision making. Whilst I continue to be frustrated that he could not get involved and am frustrated at the decision that was made by the authority, I completely understand the position. Therefore, I was very pleased that, in the statement of 15 December last year, the government—after a review based on available information and studies that had been done—was able to make the announcement excluding any future urban roads from an ability to get the type of relief that was available under this legislation. Of course, I was upset that it could not be made retrospective to the City Link proposal, but I understood that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So the intentions of the opposition, when in government, were clear. Urban roads were out. As the honourable member for  Gellibrand stated at the time in the statement, and has stated today, it was on the basis of studies
        <break page="2982" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         such as the EPAC Private Infrastructure Task Force, which had been released in October and had concluded that privately financed projects were `likely to be least advantageous for urban roads', that it was found that there was little efficiency to be gained from private ownership of roads.

        It was a position that had been well considered; it was a position and a decision that was not taken lightly. We have to understand, as has been indicated by other contributors to today's debate, that, to ensure a private urban road project such as City Link in Melbourne could succeed and bring the type of economic benefit outlined by other people in this debate, other measures were being taken by the Victorian state government to ensure profitability. They included, as has been said, the plan put in place by legislation to reduce Footscray Road from eight to four lanes to force commuters onto the City Link.

        I said in this place in November last year that, as another initiative of the One Nation project, the federal government had provided $20 million to upgrade the South Dynon railway terminal. What is the access road to the South Dynon railway terminal? Footscray Road. The City Link legislation had the serious implication of restricting access to this terminal. So, on the one hand, through the direct provision of funds, there had been an upgrading of a part of idle infrastructure and, on the other hand, as a consequence of a privately funded project, the benefits gained by that public funding were to be reduced; and, even worse, the private project was to gain tax relief. That just does not make any sense.

         a reduction in the overall benefit to the community. When we are challenged today and told that, by supporting the amendments that were made to this legislation in the Senate, we are in some way hampering future investment that could be made with the assistance of this legislation, that is a nonsense. The government has the clear option of accepting this amendment and allowing all those projects that come under this legislation to go forward. We accept that there are a range—a raft—of proposals that have been outlined that will benefit from this legislation. But do not tell us in this place that, in supporting the removal of urban roads from under the umbrella of this legislation, we are in some way blocking the other legislation.

         The Treasurer issued a press release on Monday. He felt that by making this announcement he was removing uncertainty in the financial markets.

          In many areas it is clear what this government is doing and we can see who are the winners and who are the losers. In this measure, the government is assisting in lining the pockets of tollway owners. The perpetuation of this borrowing concession for private urban roads has been described as `appallingly targeted'. But it is more crass than that; it is simply a gift. As has been outlined by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) in his lead response on this legislation for the opposition, it is at a time when the disadvantaged in the community face savage and unnecessary cuts, which will be contained in the August budget. The unemployed, pension ers, low&amp;hyphen;paid workers, refugees, migrants and many others all face a grim future with this government. But not, it seems, tollway owners.

         One of the consistent things that can be said about this week's events in a whole host of areas—and this underscores it—is that the government has the ability to combine bad policy with bad process. This is not a question of whether or not to use the taxation system or other means to stimulate private investment infrastructure; it is about when it is appropriate to do so. That is what underpinned the measures that set up this authority in One Nation. That is what underpinned it and said what it was all about. Where it is appropriate, tax concessions are an appropriate measure. The economic rationale and the broader social objectives for using taxpayers' dollars for private urban roads is no longer there.

The member for Scullin raised the issue of private ownership versus public ownership—as if public ownership of infrastructure in Australia is fundamental, rather than private ownership having some say in infrastructure and having some ownership. That is a very old socialist position in regard to community life and government within the country. I think that sort of

He was legislating by dorothy dixer on Monday when he announced that they were planning to proceed with these tax concessions. The Democrats in the Senate had every right to move this amendment on the development allowance legislation.

        I wish to cite to the House some examples of how these projects have been an absolute shambles, particularly in New South Wales as they were established by the Greiner and Fahey governments. Have a look at the M5, which runs from the crossroads in my electorate to Beverly Hills. It was public money the Greiner government put into this private tollway. They put in seed funds. They gave the private company a low interest loan. Not only that but, under the freedom of information provisions extracted from the state government, there is a clause in the contract which says that, if the traffic volume falls below a certain level, a public subsidy will guarantee income to the private company.

        The member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) nods his head. He worked in the Premier's office at the time. He was one of the authors of the secret contract. He knows of the extent to which this is nothing more than business welfare—that, if the traffic volume drops below a certain level, the state taxpayer kicks in again. For the state taxpayer to be forced to kick in when the traffic volume falls below a certain level is another instance of Fahey and Greiner financial waste and mismanagement, and it is an inappropriate use of state taxpayer funds—and the member opposite knows it.

         in this debate: that the Liberal Party is not opposed to welfare as long as it is business welfare, that the Liberal Party is not opposed to rent seeking as long as it is rent seeking by the big end of town and that the Liberal Party is not opposed to subsidies and tax concessions as long as they go to big business mates.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The member for O'Connor challenged the Labor Party to point out the problems and the rorts in the tollway projects. He should examine the M5 project in Sydney and ask himself: is it a problem when public money gets caught up with private money as part of secret deals being arrived at without public scrutiny and accountability? Is it a problem if the public sector underwrites these projects by saying that, if the tollway volume falls below a certain level, the taxpayer kicks in with more public money? Is it a problem with these roads if the surrounding traffic is all funnelled on to these tollways? Is it a problem with these roads that, once you get on them, you cannot get off them before you pay your toll—that the exit ramps are blocked, barricaded off, so that the flow of urban traffic is restricted?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I will give the member for O'Connor a perfect instance of a rort, of a major difficulty, with the M5. In my electorate, the then state Greiner government signed up as an aspect of their contract that if a future state government were to build what they call the Brickmakers Creek deviation, to take traffic away from Liverpool towards the Cumberland Highway off the M5, then for every car that went along the Brickmakers Creek deviation the taxpayer, the state government, would need to pay a levy to the private tollway company. How big a rort is that? If you build a public road off the M5 the taxpayer then has to fund a levy to the private company for every single car that uses that road.

         offices. He knows the sham. He knows the rorts. He was there watching the contract being drawn up. He should lean over to his colleague the member for O'Connor and say, `Listen, Wilson, these are rorts, these are major problems, these are abuses of federal taxpayer and state taxpayer funding. Let's close down the rorts.' If he were honest with himself he would say, `Let's close down the rorts.'

       <para first-indent="16">
        It gets even worse with the M2 project, which the Fahey government signed up to in Sydney. The state government is now restricted from building a rail line along the north&amp;hyphen;west corridor of urban planning in Sydney because, if they did, they would have to pay a levy to the private owners of the M2 tollway for every single train that went along the rail line. That is an abomination. One of the greatest rorts in the history of Australian governance is the idea that if there is a public transport competitor on the same urban corridor against a private tollway the government is obliged to pay a levy for every single train that passes along that rail line.

        This is not good planning. This is not good public sector management. It is waste and mismanagement.

        You can find a thousand reasons why we have urban tollways but the reality is that the governments of the day are not providing enough money for roads. Nobody led the way in cutting those road funds more than the previous federal government. It is not a question of argument; it is a question of the figures. They are all there to be seen in the federal budget papers. As I said, there was almost a halving of federal grants, in nominal terms, from about $1.2 billion to $800 million while the Labor Party was in government.

        In the second reading debate, the point made about urban roads was that economic studies have indicated that there is no economic benefit in allowing them to be under this umbrella to get the benefit. As the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) indicated, when we talk about the M2 in New South Wales and the City Link project in Victoria, we give examples of urban roads that are being put in place by private firms that have had to be propped up.

That is what I said in my second reading contribution. This type of concession has its uses, and there are types of things that are appropriate to give the concession to, but

        The honourable member for O'Connor came in here and talked about the public transport system in Hong Kong. The proposal that was on the books in Victoria, a proposal, I understand, where people were even being encouraged to look for the type of concession that is available through this legislation, was to have a light rail or heavy rail from Tullamarine into the city. There would be no problem; there would be a parallel road, being the Tullamarine Freeway as it stands. But to relieve the congestion on that road to make it more efficient it was being suggested that we consider a public transport link to the airport.

        The Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), who is at the table, might be correct: I might wear on my sleeve that I am for public ownership in the first case. I do not mind being accused of that, but I am willing to go through the debate and look at suggestions. In the case of Tullamarine, if there were to be a public transport link to the city there would have to be payments made to Transurban because it is part of the deal—it is part of the contract; it is in the legislation that, if there are any changes made by opening up roads or lanes of roads that have been closed, there has to be compensation paid. And if there is an alternative public transport link between the airport and the city, this compensation has to be paid to Transurban.

        In the case of Tullamarine, there are going to be a couple more lanes of an already state and federally funded road linking in to tunnels across the city and then out on to the south&amp;hyphen;eastern freeway, which has, in the main, been funded out of taxes. The public, through the state government, has to pay compensation if we put in a public transport link. It has been mentioned that public transport is in some way not appropriate to save metropolitan Melbourne or metropolitan Sydney. What a nonsense!

Indeed, notwithstanding the best advice from Treasury and advice from a reputable firm of accountants, it turned out that the estimate to remove the toll was undershot by some $50 million. Unfortunately, that commitment, made in good faith, I might add, was not able to be honoured.

It is true that you can take different routes to try to avoid the toll but this merely adds to the length of the trip.

        Anything that ensures that there is open competition between the public provision of roads, as I think is a major responsibility for state governments, local councils and private entrepreneurs who usually utilise former lapsed or defeated premiers on their boards of directors, I believe that that competition should be open and fair. If there is a preference at a Commonwealth level, we should always opt for the public provision of the toll.

The opposition members could have probably been called the `Melbourne City Link members of the opposition' because that is where the main debate has focused. They seem to be obsessed with tollways, yet how did we get this legislation to start with? It was brought in by the Labor government in 1992. Now they are saying, `Some people have come on board and we don't like those people who are investing in some of the infrastructure projects.' It has been a geographic, geocentric sort of debate here today where they have not shown any interest in the national perspective of Australia at all; they have been very interested in their own seats.

They do not like private enterprise. They do not like people who make profits, obviously, out of this debate. It is very clear that they are anti profit making. They are anti private enterprise. As the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) said, they really are against the small investors who group together and invest money in large infrastructure projects. They are very much opposed to the small people grouping together through superannuation funds to try to increase the capital infrastructure in this country of ours. They are opposed to thousands, if not millions, of Australians working in that way for the

         When you really think about it, we are talking about, say, $75 million worth of tax concessions. Labor members coming into this parliament are rejecting it by saying that it is terrible to give that amount in concessions when there are billions of private enterprise dollars for building infrastructure coming into this country. So I think it is time that we really did wind up the debate on this issue. I am strongly supportive of the amendments, and I encourage the opposition to agree to the amendments.

          —by leave—As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the JCPA has a statutory responsibility to examine all reports of the Auditor-General which are tabled in parliament. The report I have just tabled, report 344, is the latest report produced by the JCPA in fulfilment of that responsibility. It is the result of the committee's examination of the audit reports which were tabled in the financial years 1993-94 and 1994-95.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I should make clear at the outset that this report is largely the work of the former JCPA, the committee established in the last parliament under the chairmanship of the former member for Oxley, Mr Les Scott. Although the current committee has approved the report, the report was prepared by the former committee on the basis of evidence it sought and received.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the period covered by this report, the Auditor-General presented 75 audit reports. A good number of them have already been reviewed by parliamentary committees. During the last parliament the JCPA tabled five reports which reviewed or commented on reports of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General. They were: report 332, on the operation of the Australian government credit card system; report 333, on the sale of Aussat; report 338, on accrual reporting and accounting; report 340, on cash management; and, report 341, on the administration of specific purpose, or tied grants. In addition, 10 other audit reports were referred to and considered by other parliamentary committees.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In report 344, which I have just tabled, the committee comments on the most significant
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          issues emerging from those audit reports which have not previously been considered by the JCPA or other committees of this parliament. In the majority of cases, agencies which were the subject of audit findings in the years under review have responded positively and promptly to the Auditor-General's recommendations. There are, however, some cases where action has not been taken to correct management failures or where performance can be further improved. It is these cases which are referred to in report 344.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The report contains five recommendations for further action. The recommendations are directed to the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, in relation to any new program developed to replace the former national priority (reserve) fund—which provided funding to educational institutions for management improvement projects; the Australian Taxation Office, in relation to work it has under way to identify the true cost of its review and litigation activities; the Department of Health and Family Services, in relation to its program of validating nursing home funding; and the Department of Defence in relation to two aspects of its procedures for managing defence procurement contracts.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The latter two are the most significant of these recommendations and I would like to briefly outline the reasons behind the committee's recommendations. I turn first to the nursing home validation program administered by the Department of Health and Family Services. The validation of nursing home payments is an important part of the accountability framework for nursing homes. It provides an assurance that Commonwealth moneys have been disbursed in accordance with the agreed funding arrangements for nursing homes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For some years now, the department of health has been endeavouring to clear a substantial backlog in its validation program. Advice received during the review was that 5,000 validations were outstanding in mid&amp;hyphen;1994. The department has repeatedly given assurances to parliament that it has action in hand to complete all outstanding validations by the end of 1996&amp;hyphen;97. The latest advice in
         <break page="2995" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          this regard was given to the committee in a submission dated 9 January 1996. The committee is encouraged by the priority being given to the program.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, advice from the Australian National Audit Office indicates that there is a substantial risk that the department will not complete its validation program by the end of 1996&amp;hyphen;97 and will not recover significant sums of money owing to the Commonwealth. In the ANAO's estimation, up to $20 million of money owing to the Commonwealth is at risk of non&amp;hyphen;collection.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Given the longstanding public and parliamentary interest in the issue and the various commitments and reassurances made by the department in recent years, the non&amp;hyphen;recovery of this money would represent a significant failure by the department. The committee believes it is appropriate at this time for the department to provide the parliament with a complete, clear and unambiguous statement of the strategy it is employing to achieve its goal of clearing the backlog by the end of 1996&amp;hyphen;97. The committee has made a lengthy recommendation to this effect.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I should make it clear that the committee is not commenting on the policy behind the validation program, nor is it encouraging the department to get tough with nursing homes. We are merely seeking to ensure that the department is held to its promises and clearly explains the management strategies it is employing to achieve the targets it has set.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would also like to highlight the committee's comments on external scrutiny of major defence contracts. In the report the committee argues that the quality of external scrutiny of major defence contracts would be enhanced if the Australian National Audit Office were allowed access to the costing and pricing records of defence contractors. This is a position which the committee first argued in report 337 in relation to the contractual arrangements for the new submarine project, which the ANAO has supported.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
          The Department of Defence has in the past rejected these calls, asserting that such access would come at a premium risk for the Com monwealth; risk disclosure of commercially sensitive contractor records; and add to the time taken to complete defence projects. The committee is not persuaded that these objections are necessarily valid and, in any event, that they outweigh the potential benefits of allowing ANAO access. The committee stands by the views expressed in report 337 that, firstly, it is not unreasonable to require contractors involved in major projects to provide accurate and complete information in support of quotes and claims; and, secondly, it is not unreasonable that the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General be able to verify those claims through access to contractor records.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Last week's revelations about the delays and apparently unusual payment patterns to contractors involved in the Jindalee operational radar network does not reassure me that the Commonwealth's interests are well protected by the current arrangements. I foreshadow that the JCPA will look more closely at the Jindalee project shortly.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In concluding, I would like to advise the House that the JCPA has recently changed the focus of its audit report review procedures. In the past, most audit reports were subject to a desk review where agencies were asked to provide written submissions to the committee. These desk reviews resulted in compendium reports like the report I just tabled. The committee considers that the timeliness and effectiveness of its services would be enhanced if, instead of conducting desk reviews, it conducted public hearings every three months to examine the findings of significant audit reports tabled in the previous quarter.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <break page="2996" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          Under these new procedures, witnesses from the Australia National Audit Office and from each audited agency will be called to give evidence on the nature and appropriateness of the audit findings and of the responses from audited agencies. As well as increasing the initial impact of audit reports and resulting in more timely and effective parliamentary scrutiny of audit reports, these new processes will strengthen the Auditor's hand in any follow&amp;hyphen;up audits. The Auditor&amp;hyphen;General will be able to test the future performance of agencies against commitments given to the committee at these public hearings. These new proced ures are confirmation of the JCPA's commitment to ensuring that the community receives full value from the work of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, I would like to thank all those people who contributed to the committee's review of the 1993-94 and 1994-95 audit reports, people who prepared submissions, people who gave evidence at public hearings and, of course, the committee staff. On this occasion, the staff involved in the report were John Carter, Laura Gillies, Bob Morris and Jennifer Hughson. They have again met the standards of excellence parliament has come to expect of the JCPA's dedicated staff. I commend the report to the House.

           Report 344: A continuing focus on accountability
          </emphasis>
          . The work that was undertaken by the JCPA in the 37th Parliament revolved very heavily around the accountability processes of the Commonwealth, particularly with regard to the expenditure of very large sums of taxpayers' money.

         The chairman has pointed out that this report is a report on audit reports covering the years 1993 to 1995. One of the recommendations contained in this report relating to the Australian Taxation Office states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Australian Taxation Office should continue its work in identifying the true cost of service delivery in the ATO, in collaboration with other Commonwealth agencies as appropriate. As part of this task, the project to identify the costs of the ATOs litigation activity should be completed, with appropriate procedures and systems in place, as soon as possible.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is an area of constant concern in reporting from constituents to members of parliament the activities of the Australian Taxation Office. We understand and acknowledge that their brief is to collect what is due and payable to the Commonwealth by way of tax. But when the tax office goes out and expends some hundreds of thousands of dollars to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          maybe collect a $50,000 debt, there must be a better and more efficient way of doing it.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is what this recommendation is asking—that the ATO review those practices. In some cases, and without putting too much of an inference on it, the tax office, with the weight and resources of the Commonwealth behind them, will pursue someone into the ground, right beneath the surface of the ground, if they feel that is necessary. There needs to be greater accountability and transparency in that process of the activities of the Australian Taxation Office. It is easy for officers of the ATO, with the enormous resources of the Commonwealth behind them, to pursue someone through the courts. But if it is inefficient, in so far as what is collected as a ratio of what is spent in the collection, it does not make good sense. I think the commissioner and the ATO should review that particular circumstance.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the other areas covered in this report was audit report No. 10 of 1994-95, entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Efficiency audit, cash management in Commonwealth government departments
         </emphasis>
         . It was a very interesting and fairly quick audit report. It was done after the incumbent Auditor-General was appointed by the previous government. He had certain expertise coming out of the Department of Finance. That particular audit report indicated that with different cash management practices by the Commonwealth there could be a saving of upwards of $300 million.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I commend that particular audit report to the House and to the government. They should take close scrutiny of that. It was done in a very sensible manner and with a fair bit of background, as far as the Auditor-General is concerned. I think something the government should take on board is that there are major efficiencies to be gained and savings to be made just by the improvement of the cash management practices of the Commonwealth.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, I go to a comment the chairman of the committee made in presenting this report with regard to the access that the ANAO has to auditing the contracts of different projects in and around the Department of Defence. In the former parliament we conducted a fairly extensive inquiry into the contracts that were
         <break page="2997" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          established between the Department of Defence and the Australian Submarine Corporation and the, to say the least, unusual form of contract that was entered into.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We found that with about 20 per cent of the contract being delivered upon by the ASC, about 80 per cent of the contract price had been paid over. It was not a contract which involved peanuts—it was a $6 billion project. As the chairman pointed out, the committee will obviously now get the opportunity to hold an inquiry into the contract and the undertaking of the contract into the Jindalee project. But the same situation seems to be being mirrored, to a certain extent, in that contract.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is a question there about the access the ANAO may and should get to auditing some of those defence department contracts. When it is all said and done, it is one of the biggest spending departments of the Commonwealth. The taxpayers of Australia, through their representatives in this place, and the Auditor-General's office, have a right to know just how those contracts are being undertaken on their behalf and how those taxpayers' dollars are being spent. I commend the report to the House.

         The most significant recommendations in the report were the nine recommendations dealing with the management by the Department of Defence of the new submarine project. Some of these recommendations were agreed to while others were rejected. It is interesting to note that a number of themes in the committee's report, such as the quantum and timing of advance payments to contractors, recovery of advance payments which have not been used in accordance with the contract, the assessment and management of opportunity costs and allowing ANAO access to contractor price of records, also feature in the recent audit report on management of the Jindalee operational radar network project. The committee is keen to explore these issues further in relation to the JORN project and will be holding hearings on the matter over the next few months.

Some of the main elements of criticism are that the JCPA has underestimated the complexity of the Commonwealth's cash management operations; that the JCPA has erred in suggesting that it is possible to establish objective Commonwealth&amp;hyphen;wide rules for measuring cash management performance; and that, in calling for the Commonwealth's cash management performance to be compared with the best practice in the public and private sectors, the JCPA has overestimated the relevance of cash management functions performed by state governments and large corporations.

         Notwithstanding these responses, it is worth noting that there are a number of recommendations in the report which have been accepted. I cite two examples: first, that all agencies from now on create and maintain their own registers of all bank accounts they operate. The committee had found that there were in excess of 2,000 bank accounts operated by Commonwealth agencies and that many agencies had inadequate records of the existence of these accounts or of the amount of money held in them. Secondly, the Department of Finance, the Australian Taxation Office and the Reserve Bank will expedite the development of agency banking arrangements with Australia Post to allow tax receipts to be credited with the Reserve Bank on the day of deposit.

         The Treasury has also reported that it has commissioned a consultancy to examine options for institutional and resourcing arrangements for the Commonwealth's debt management function, including aspects of Treasury's current cash management operation. This appears to be in response to a suggestion from the committee that the scope for contracting out the cash management function be examined.

         —In recent weeks Australia has witnessed some losses of life on an unprecedented scale which have generated a great deal of debate and a national desire to take steps to prevent any more such devastation. Unfortunately, we can only refer to hindsight after the event. Would it not have been wonderful if we could have stepped up to the Port Arthur gunman and taken his rifle from him before he started pulling the trigger. What if we were able to reach into the cockpit of the doomed Black Hawk helicopter and correct whatever was about to make it lurch to the right. What if we were able to send a mechanic to the Monarch Airlines aircraft and fix the problems that were destined to take those lovely schoolgirls out of this world at such a special stage in their lives.

Just in my home town of Perth alone—and if I started singling out all the other capital cities of Australia I would be here all day—and this is only recently, on 17 May last year there was  a near miss between a Boeing 747 and an executive jet only four or five miles north of Perth airport. On 13 October 1995 there was a near miss between a Qantas BA146 and a light aircraft out of Jandakot about five miles south of Perth airport.

          The inquiry was presented with figures from the CAA resources review which forecast staff numbers in the Air Traffic Services Branch, which is largely Australia's air traffic controllers, as needing only 1,250 people by July 1996.

          In the corporate plan of Airservices Australia, tabled in parliament in November last year, these figures had been amended to 2,055 for the same month, an increase of 805. Airservices Australia's own documents show that they got rid of too many air traffic controllers and the expertise that they possess. This is reflected in the frenzied recruiting drive that has been under way over the past 12 months or so.

          It is one thing to recruit trainees but it is another thing to replace the expertise that left Airservices Australia with the departing air traffic controllers.

        I talk on this topic with some authority owing to the fact that I am a fitter and turner by trade. I have a vast knowledge in the area of mechanics, particularly in relation to aviation. So, when I talk on aviation safety and aircraft maintenance in general, I can say that I do understand the working mechanisms of aircraft, where we are going and what we need to be doing. As well as that, I am a pilot. I own an aircraft, a Cessna 310, and I have had my aircraft for approximately five years.

If your toilet is blocked, you do not call a funeral director, although I suppose that depends on which part of you is caught there. If you have a law firm, once again, you do not employ somebody that is out of the field; I imagine the job description would say you should employ a lawyer.

         So what are the people on the other side here, the Labor Party, going to do in relation to the civil aviation bill? Will they run with what the general public think or will they maintain an agenda that throws mud in the face of commonsense? I think the Labor Party will support this bill because it is a change that has been sought for years. It is a change that the owners and operators of aircraft wish to have, and they want this government to make sure it happens.

The feeling is the same no matter whom you speak to when you talk about the Civil Aviation Authority. The general public say, `Be genuinely careful if you get mixed up with the Civil Aviation Authority, particularly inspectors or airworthiness inspectors because they are like the Gestapo.'

         —I want to make a brief comment on the ministerial statement on aviation safety regulation that we are discussing this afternoon. It is a very sobering subject and a very important subject in this country. I must say, from the outset, that I believe this parliament should take a bipartisan approach to the greatest extent possible on this matter. The statement emanates from the Monarch crash where seven people lost their lives and, subsequently, the Seaview crash where eight people lost their lives.

        The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) made a statement in the House with regard to those two very unfortunate accidents in Australian aviation history. He referred also to the near fatal crash of the DC3 that crashed into the end of the second runway in Botany Bay. At the end of the ministerial statement the minister indicated that he was going to instigate a review of the regulatory framework or, as he put it, a complete overhaul of air safety in Australia.

        <para first-indent="16">
         That matter has an interesting history. I go back to my first entering this place following the March 1993 election. In the last three years, in the last parliament, I was a member of the Public Accounts Committee which undertook a fairly lengthy inquiry into the commercialisation aspects of government business enterprises. One of the GBEs that we focused that inquiry on was the CAA and the activities of the CAA and the impacts of commercialisation on that organisation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Keep in mind that the old CAA, as it then was, was charged with responsibility for air safety as well as air traffic control. I think you will find in the recommendations of the report from the JCPA that from time to time there were going to be conflicts of interest between the regulatory role of the air safety aspect that the CAA was charged with implementing and the commercial activities in that area as well as the commercial activities of air traffic control. By `commercial activities' I mean the commitment that they must make, or is forced upon them, to provide a dividend to government, government being the shareholder of that particular GBE.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the recommendations that came out of that report was that those two disciplines in that organisation should be split, that the air safety controls and regulatory operations of CAA should be operated quite separately and as an agency of the department. The air traffic control could continue as a commercial activity outside as a GBE which, I acknowledge, subsequently took place.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I forget the date that the former minister in the former government initiated that action but it certainly happened. Out of that came Airservices Australia, controlling air traffic around Australia, and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority which is the subject of a bill currently before the House. I think the previous speaker—the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Marek)—was alluding to that in his address. I imagine that will be dealt with by this chamber this afternoon as it did not get finalised in the Main Committee this morning. That revolves around different points of view as to the make&amp;hyphen;up of the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.

          I think it is fair enough to say that the media have asked a number of questions, following the publication of the report of the coronial inquiry into the Monarch crash, as to whether things at CASA have changed from the time that it was part of CAA. Certainly the management structure has, but it is quite possible that a lot of the people working in it are still the people that were working within the CAA. A lot of those people are probably very good operators but, as the minister has pointed out in his ministerial statement, they are still working to the same regulatory framework. He seems to indicate that that is out of date and in need of review. I think that probably the majority of members of this House would agree, although they may not agree as to whether that review should be undertaken by the mechanisms that the minister is proposing to put in place or by the parliamentary committee which was the author of the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         <para first-indent="16">
          I highlight that it was on 3 May 1994 that the now minister was speaking on a bill in the House and during that speech he addressed the matter of the Monarch crash. He  indicated that previously he had forewarned the former minister that the Civil Aviation Authority had been aware for some time of the deficiencies of Monarch Air and that, despite recommendations by airworthiness inspectors to ground the operator, these recommendations had been overruled by senior management. That was echoed in the report that the coroner brought down into the Monarch crash and in a couple of the comments that the coroner made about the CAA. He said:

          `CAA failed Monarch passengers'. That was a quote from the coroner. It went on to say:

         <para font-size="-=2">

           found that CAA management bullied its safety inspectors, protected the airline industry from some constraints of safety regulations and failed to ground Monarch and revoke its licence.

         <para>
          I have spoken on this issue a couple of times in this place and in committee meetings and I am not in the business of conducting a vendetta against particular people. A lot of the operators within the CAA are obviously very, very good airworthiness inspectors and they should not be cast under this shadow. There seemed to be a particular regime operating within CAA at the time. I go back to the committee of inquiry that I was on with the JCPA. We had the opportunity in a public hearing of talking to, I think, the Director of Air Safety at the time in a public hearing about the mechanisms and the framework that were being applied by the then CAA. This was after the Monarch crash and before the Seaview crash. He indicated to that committee at the time that the regulatory framework and the inspection mechanisms that were in place were adequate. That is on the public record. It has been recorded in

          The bottom line is that, out of all this, let us do something positive. Let us make sure that 15 Australians who perished in very tragic civil aviation circumstances in those two crashes have not died in vain; I ask that the government of Australia and this parliament do something—in a non&amp;hyphen;partisan way—about the deficiencies that were highlighted by the coroner and that were highlighted in 1994 by the then shadow minister, now the minister. He indicated in his address to this House yesterday that he wants to set up a review to completely overhaul the regulatory framework.

          There are a couple of debates taking place in this parliament today with regard to civil aviation safety. This is one of them. In regard to the other one, on the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill, there are a few more partisan points of view being put. I ask that we deal with this very, very serious matter of civil aviation safety in a sensible way and in a bipartisan way, so that the travelling public in Australia can board regular passenger transport aircraft with an ease of mind; so that they know they are going to arrive at the other end in safety because it has the imprimatur of the Commonwealth of Australia as far as the safety aspects of that operator are concerned.

They should be involved in a bipartisan way to improve the system that is being operated within Australia today.

        Let me go to a letter, which came to my hand, that has gone to the minister's office. It talks about the composition of the board, as did the honourable member who has just resumed his seat. It refers to the minister's telling Ita Buttrose what the members of the board do. He was asked what they do, and he said this:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Well they provide licences to pilots, they provide licences to what they call Air Operator Certificates to airlines, they inspect aircraft, they examine—
       </para>
       <para>
        That is nonsense. They do not do that. The officers of the organisation do that, but the members of the board do not. The letter went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Minister has persistently told the media, in terms contrary to the memorandum above, that "75% of the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority have no prior experience with aviation".

        That is, that this parliament decided upon. It refers then to the membership of the board. It says that it does not consist of four members, as has commonly been stated, that there are five members. The members are Captain Molloy, Justice Fisher, Gaby Hollows, and the other one I will come to as I read through this, Captain Leroy Keith. The letter states:

This is a fundamental issue because if there is public reporting then it will alert all of us in the public as to how different air operators are undertaking their work and ensuring that their planes are safe. It will mean that we will know whether they are contravening the regulations. They will pay the price through lost reputations and lost customer confidence if there is a contravention of those regulations. That will have market consequences for that particular company.

It sends the very powerful message that, if you really want to deliver benefits to consumers, you have got to do two things: the first thing you have got to do is get the government off the back of operators, and the second thing you have got to do is create greater conditions of competition.

In an act of spite at losing the last election, this is an opposition that will try to pull apart development in the country. This is an opposition that, out of pure spite and without any principle whatsoever, is trying to place at risk 18 projects in the mining industry; 10 in the tourism industry; six in electricity, gas and water; four in manufacturing; and three in transport and storage.

         That would not apply, of course, to members on the other side because hardly any of them are from the bush.

        This government is acutely aware of the pain being felt in the bush. I would hope that all members here would applaud the fact that next week, in this place, the government is honouring another pre-election pledge with the holding of the National Rural Finance Summit, from 3-5 July.

        We had an enthusiastic response from all 200&amp;hyphen;plus invitees. They will represent all sectors involved in agriculture, including about 60 grassroots farmers and about 30 representatives of farmer organisations. They will be joined by representatives of financial organisations, rural councillors, agricultural consultants and rural welfare and community organisations.

        We have some very important broad topics to cover. For a start, the rural finance industry, past, present and future; key elements of successful farming; and tax provisions for farmers. If ever we saw illogical, stupid and ill-conceived policy flip&amp;hyphen;flopping around, it was from the previous government. I think the previous Prime Minister used to call it policy dexterity, which meant `backslips' all over the place. Peter Walsh, when he was the Minister for Finance, reckoned we had to get rid of IEDs—income equalisation deposits—which were the great mechanism by which the rural sector prepared for downturns. We had to get rid of them because farmers were rorting them—a great line from the government of the day. They were always on about farmers rorting schemes.

We thus discussed it again later that evening. We both agreed to sleep on it. I spoke to Peter Costello, the Deputy Leader, about it and we all agreed there was no alternative.'

        The government in the last few weeks has established a group called the Sydney Airport Community Forum. It is a group designed to deal with the aircraft noise problems of Sydney airport and other related problems as a result of the operations at Sydney airport. It is made up of some 18 people and will involve members of both federal and state parliaments, Liberal and Labor, as well as involving members of local government, local community groups and also industry organisations.

       <para first-indent="16">
        This organisation, the Sydney Airport Community Forum, replaces an organisation that was established just over 12 months ago by the former government, called the Sydney Airport Consultative Committee. This committee was made up of some 44 members and it was regarded, by those people who attended those meetings, as being unwieldy. As a result of it being so large and unwieldy it could not form a consensus and, therefore, make a useful contribution to resolving the problems of aircraft noise emanating from the Sydney airport.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Not only was that committee unwieldy and unable to form a consensus, but honourable members would be interested to know that it was also an expensive committee to run. It cost the taxpayers some $142,000 to run for 12 months. Much of that cost was incurred by the chairman who, of course, was appointed by the former Minister for Transport. The chairman was Mr Joe Riordan, a former state Labor member of parliament.

        We all recall Neville Wran. Neville Wran was treated extraordinarily well by the former Minister for Transport, the member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith, to the tune of several hundred thousand dollars when he was made chairman of the board of ANL. Another Labor mate, Joe Riordan, for his chairing of this organisation one day per month for 12 months, received $30,314. But this is not the end of the costs involved with looking after `our mates'. This Labor mate also took, at the taxpayers' expense, a round&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;world trip of 18 days duration earlier this year. That cost the taxpayers of Australia some $17,058. So when it comes to looking after one's mates, we know who does it best—and it is them over there, and it is at the cost of the taxpayer.

I take this opportunity of reiterating that this is Refugee Week and an appropriate time to reflect on matters relating to refugees—those who I think are the most vulnerable people, deserving of our support and deserving of continued programs to assist with their resettlement. But at times there are situations in which people are not entitled to be seen as refugees or assessed as such and governments need to respond to that situation.

        The comprehensive plan of action devised by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and supported by 51 members of the United Nations was set up to deal with the growing recognition that there were large numbers of people leaving Vietnam and Laos for economic rather than political reasons. Under that plan, over 100,000 Vietnamese and Laotians have voluntarily returned to their former countries. These people had been screened out by countries to which they had gone and are to return to their homes. They remain, in many cases, in camps in Asia now. A significant proportion of the remaining people have been resisting repatriation in the hope of resettlement in countries such as Australia.

        The coalition continues to be a strong supporter of the comprehensive plan of action. It is now drawing to a close. We have spent over $9 million in assistance. We have resettled over 18,000 bona fide asylum seekers here in Australia. We have worked particularly closely with the United Nations high commission to resolve a number of difficult and continuing situations, particularly those relating to split families. We have also brought to the attention of the United Nations situations where, it has been suggested, the processing of claims has not been adequate. Having seen the processing of the United Nations high commissioner, we are now in a

        We are in a situation now where Malaysia has just completed the processing and has closed its camps. The Vietnamese community has been asking many of us to look at the situation and to look at whether or not further steps can be taken to resettle people here in Australia and elsewhere. I think the situation needs to be clearly understood that in these cases the people have been properly assessed. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has monitored progress. We have raised concerns where they have been raised with us about individuals. The situation now is one where the countries concerned that continue to have asylum seekers who have been screened out will have to return them, both compulsorily and voluntarily. A voluntary arrangement is to be preferred but if it cannot be completed in that way, orderly repatriation will be supported by Australia.

They are probably one of the best prepared teams we have ever sent away to the Olympics. I think it is a reflection on the marked improvement of training standards and facilities. The sporting facilities provided by governments, both at the Commonwealth and the state level, over the last decade or so have played a very substantial part in that process. So there is a great investment in both the hearts and the pockets of many Australians behind our team as they go to the Olympics.

         —Mr Speaker, in recent days you and the clerk have written to members outlining some of the savings proposals that the House of Representatives department has to achieve the $10 million worth of savings that the Minister for Finance has required you and the President to achieve. Will you undertake to provide members with a consolidated list of those savings proposals across both the House of Representatives department and the three joint departments, prior to the House rising? I understand the Senate Appropriations and Staffing Committee has considered these matters and has circulated a report to senators. Could you ensure that members of this House, before its rising, receive the same information?

         —Mr Speaker, I draw your attention and the attention of all members to what I believe has been a gross abuse of the prerogatives and privileges of this parliament. I refer to the very serious allegations that were made in the last parliament—under privilege of course—that Mr Mark Leibler, a constituent of mine, a prominent citizen, a prominent Melbourne lawyer and a leader of the Jewish community, was guilty of distributing pornographic material and laundering money.

        That allegation was based on a series of documents which were found, on investigation by the Federal Police, to be false. I would have expected and hoped that the member involved would have apologised and withdrawn those allegations, but in fact—if anything—he continued to assert them.

        , the circumstances surrounding the production of that material have been dealt with at great length. It amounts to what I would regard as a serious criminal conspiracy by members of the LaRouche group who set out to smear and defame members and leaders of the Jewish community. That is the allegation being made. It has been documented at great length in this article and it was explored in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        My concern is to raise this issue in two ways. First of all, I believe that the privileges that attach to members in this parliament are an essential and vital part of our parliamentary process. In the past, it seems to me that it has been the practice that, if a member gets his facts wrong, and a citizen's reputation is besmirched, the member in the wrong apologises and withdraws. But in this case, what we have is clearly a conspiracy to use the forms and processes of this House in a way in which they were never meant to be used.

         The first question, sir, that I would direct to your attention is whether, in those circumstances, that abuse constitutes in itself a breach of the prerogatives of this parliament. If not, what are the proper forms and processes, where our institution is used in this way to demean and discredit a public citizen carrying out his religious beliefs and his duties, to protect him from this kind of smear against which he cannot resort to the normal legal protection? I would ask you, Mr Speaker, if you share my concern, to perhaps consider referring this very important matter to the Privileges Committee because the reputation of all members of this parliament, and our processes and prerogatives, are very much involved and at stake.

        I do not wish to pursue this particular incident, but I do wish to raise a broader question: that is, the nature of obligations which members of this place undertake with respect to their behaviour when they are in the hands of the House of Representatives transport service. In particular, my brief inquiries have revealed that there is nothing specified in writing with respect to how members do behave, and there are a number of areas of potential conflict which could arise. For example, members may at times ask a driver to break the road rules in order to get to a place quicker than they otherwise would. They could possibly ask for a car to be used for unauthorised purposes. They could possibly ask a driver to overload the car with excessive numbers of passengers.

        Drivers of Comcars for the House of Representatives transport service are sometimes in a difficult position, because their customers are in an indirect way also their bosses. If their direct boss says one thing and the customer says the opposite, that can place them in a very difficult position. I would ask the Speaker whether he can advise the House what arrangements are in place, if any, to ensure that members do conduct themselves properly in Comcars, do not defy legitimate requests of the driver or give them incorrect or unlawful instructions. If not, can he do something to correct that situation?

         —by leave—For the information of honourable members, I present the report on the deaths of Australian based journalists in East Timor in 1975, prepared by Mr Tom Sherman, AO, the former Chairman
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          of the National Crime Authority. As many honourable members will know, the journalists were Gary Cunningham, Roger East, Brian Peters, Malcolm Rennie, Greg Shackleton and Tony Stewart.
         </break>
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Sherman was appointed by the previous government in November 1995 following claims that there was additional information available on the deaths, especially from East Timorese living abroad. Mr Sherman's brief was `to gather such new evidence as may be available from these sources—fully respecting such confidentiality requirements as witnesses may seek to impose—and to evaluate its prima facie weight'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Following the change of government, I made it clear that the new government was prepared to see Mr Sherman's process through to completion, even though we did not initiate the exercise. The circumstances surrounding the deaths of these six journalists have continued to remain a matter of concern to the relatives of the deceased and, more generally, of public interest over the years. We have therefore fully cooperated with Mr Sherman.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would highlight that the government has been thoroughly transparent on this issue. In this context I record that Mr Sherman approached me towards the end of his evaluation and asked for access to all relevant intelligence material held by the government. In considering his request, I was conscious that this material had never been reviewed outside of government before. I decided, after consultation with my colleague the Minister for Defence, Mr McLachlan, that Mr Sherman should have access to all relevant intelligence material, including material from the Defence Signals Directorate and the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. His clear conclusion on this material is set out in paragraph 2.32. I hope this will settle the various questions which have surrounded this aspect of the matter.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Sherman handed over his report to me last Friday and, contrary to media reports, there is one report only and there are no confidential annexes. I am tabling the report in its entirety. I thank Mr Sherman for the care and attention he has devoted to this important task. Mr Sherman has now retired
        <break page="3030" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         from public service, but I want to express the government's appreciation for the manner in which he has discharged his responsibilities in this and, for that matter, earlier appointments. I am sure the opposition joins us in doing so.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The findings in Mr Sherman's report are summarised in chapter 9 on page 136. There are two keys findings. The first is that it is more likely than not that Gary Cunningham, Brian Peters, Malcolm Rennie, Greg Shackleton and Tony Stewart were killed at Balibo early in the morning of 16 October 1975, probably before 7 a.m., by members of an attacking force under Indonesian officers consisting of Indonesian irregular troops and anti&amp;hyphen;Fretilin Timorese; and, in circumstances of continuing fighting between the Fretilin and anti&amp;hyphen;Fretilin forces. Elsewhere in the report at page 110, paragraph 5.86, this conclusion is expressed in the phrase `it is more likely than not that the Balibo Five were killed in the heat of battle while fighting was still taking place'. Secondly, the report finds that it is more likely than not that Roger East was summarily executed by an unidentified Indonesian soldier late in the morning of 8 December 1975 in the wharf area of Dili.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have considered Mr Sherman's report very carefully. I believe that it is as thorough an account of the circumstances of the journalists' deaths as is likely to be possible, based on information available outside Indonesia and given the passage of time. We simply do not have any other information on which to base further analysis or more definitive conclusions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am not going to comment in detail on Mr Sherman's findings, as the report speaks clearly enough for itself. However, the fact that the findings do not identify individuals responsible for the killings and are ultimately expressions of probability creates limitations on the action available to the Australian government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is also clear from Mr Sherman's report that it is unlikely that any significant further relevant information is available outside of Indonesia. Therefore, any further investigation initiated in this country is unlikely to produce any additional findings. Accordingly, I have
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         written to my Indonesian counterpart asking him to pursue any further information which would throw additional light on the conclusions reached, and I have spoken to him this morning in the terms of the letter. I am happy today to table that letter, along with the Sherman report.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have to say, however, that we all need to be clear that we cannot compel the Indonesian authorities to do something which is within their own sovereign jurisdiction, any more than they can compel the Australian authorities to do something which we might or might not want to do. In the interests of bipartisanship on this issue, let me quote the then Senator Evans who, in an interview last year, said `our problem of course is that you can't mount an investigation in another country, any more than any country can come to Australia and mount unilaterally some kind of investigation on some matter of concern to it.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In its approach to the report the government has had as its primary concern the interests of the next of kin. In the course of Tuesday and Wednesday, officers of my department and members of my staff spoke at length with the next of kin outlining the report's findings and answering their questions. Although these events occurred 20 years ago, the report will obviously awaken painful memories for family members but I hope it will also settle some of the uncertainties.

         —by leave—The opposition welcomes the tabling of the report of the Sherman inquiry, which was set in train last November by the then Labor government's foreign minister, Gareth Evans. We received a copy of the report this morning from the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). To the extent that we have been able to evaluate Mr Sherman's report, it appears to be comprehensive and to address the complex and, indeed, sensitive issues that are involved. Given the difficulties inherent in securing the cooperation of witnesses concerned about confidentiality and the obvious difficulties of taking evidence in Indonesia itself, including in East Timor, one certainly cannot conclude that a more formal judicial inquiry would have
         <break page="3031" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          produced, or could even now produce, a more extensive or reliable set of findings.

        As the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) has said, the most important conclusion of the report as far as the Balibo Five are concerned—it includes journalists Gary Cunningham, Brian Peters, Malcolm Rennie, Greg Shackleton and Tony Stewart—is that it is more likely than not they were killed by members of an attacking force under Indonesian officers consisting of Indonesian irregular troops and anti-Fretilin East Timorese and in circumstances of continuing fighting between Fretilin and anti-Fretilin forces. It needs to be said that the most important revelation in the entire report, and the one that may be of most significance in determining the Indonesian government's response to it, is the reported admission by Indonesian general and former defence minister Benny Murdani, supported in the report by admissions from General Dading, that the Australians were `in between Fretilin and the advancing Indonesian troops'.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The key conclusion as far as the other journalist, Roger East, is concerned raises serious questions for the Indonesian government. That conclusion is that it was more likely than not that he was summarily executed by an unidentified Indonesian soldier in the wharf area in Dili.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The obvious next step for the report is that it be forwarded to the Indonesian government for its consideration and response with a request for advice or any further information which would throw additional light on the conclusions reached. In this respect, I can say that the opposition supports the actions that the government has taken. We reserve our position on what further action might be possible or appropriate to take until after that response has been received.

         As the Minister for Foreign Affairs said in his statement, this report will certainly rekindle some very painful memories for the families of the dead journalists. The hearts of everyone in this House go out to those families. One reason for initiating the report was to try to bring some greater sense of certainty into our understanding of the tragic events, which have remained shrouded in consider able mystery ever since. I conclude by saying that if some of that shroud proves to have been lifted by this report, it will have admirably served its purpose.

         —by leave—I wish to speak on the statement from the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) because I had a close connection with the events surrounding this tragedy. In October 1975, I was a news producer at TCN9 in Sydney from where Sydney based cameraman Brian Peters and Melbourne based journalist Malcolm Rennie travelled to Dili to cover the escalating unrest in the Portuguese colony of East Timor.

        I was a close colleague and friend of Brian Peters, with whom I had worked earlier in my career at Channel 7 in Sydney. Brian had been to East Timor several weeks prior to what was to be that fatal second trip. He had accompanied senior executives of TCN9 on a boat trip from Darwin. During that first foray into civil war, Brian established what I later understood were firm friendships with and sympathies towards certain elements of the pro&amp;hyphen;independence Fretilin movement.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On the weekend prior to his second trip to Dili, I went skiing with him and another friend at Perisher Valley. He wore the battle fatigues—from memory, the trousers—of the Fretilin forces. He told me of this souvenir from his new friends in Dili. Given the situation in Dili at the time—I am relying on memory—there were UDT and APODETI factions loyal to an anti-Fretilin coalition of forces either supporting the integration of East Timor with Indonesia or, in the case of UDT, conservative and middle&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;road forces, a major rival of Fretilin, as described by Tom Sherman in this report.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Brian Peters's sympathies were likely to have been well known throughout East Timor. It casts no long bow to believe that the Indonesian authorities knew exactly who he was and where his sympathies lay. Once he returned to East Timor and ventured into hostile territory with the assistance of Fretilin forces, he was a marked man, and so too were his colleagues. This is no criticism of any of those newsmen, particularly Brian. It is, though, a severe criticism of the system that
        <break page="3032" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         sent them there. I do not believe that the newsmen were well enough briefed, and their ill-advised decision to try to cross the battlelines and report the invasion from the Indonesian side was tragically naive in the extreme.

        This report has brought back one of the most distressing periods of my professional life. The peer pressure to travel to the front and then cross the lines was driven by competition between the two rival networks for the scoop of a major conflict on our borders. I believe that this clouded the judgment of all the people involved. Given the information I believe was in the hands of the television companies, our spies in Dili and the Australian government, I think it was sheer folly to allow these men to undertake that trip. The report quotes one of the competing news editors from Channel 7 as saying:

        There was always the danger of competition—but I presumed they would not risk their lives to get a scoop.

        Mr John Maher, that editor, goes on to say that he was not aware that Channel 9 was also sending a crew when he sent Greg Shackleton, Tony Stewart and Gary Cunningham. From memory, the Channel 9 crew was sent in great haste to try to catch the Channel 7 crew. Comments of Brian Peters to witnesses in Dili recorded in the report quote him saying that he had to get to the border because Channel 7 was there and he could be in trouble with his bosses. I know from a personal point of view that such was the greater than usual competition in the news services at the time with a new Sydney-Melbourne Channel 9 news link-up called News Centre 9. Several important executive reputations were riding on the result. I have no doubt Brian Peters's observations had even more meaning then. He was being driven not only by his professional news instincts but also by some very powerful expectations in his company's news hierarchy that went right to the very top.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I have not read this report in detail. I deliberated over whether to make a formal submission to it. I decided that there had been too many expedient excuses made over East Timor and that it was not worth anyone's

         while. However, these comments are now on the public record. I believe that these men were murdered by forces under Indonesian control. Whether they were irregular or regular Indonesian troops we may never know.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I do believe that prior intelligence on the crew's movements, and particularly Brian Peters's first visit to Dili and the contacts he made, made their fate inevitable. Only a stronger response by the Whitlam government at the time to the threatened invasion could have avoided the loss of these men and the tragedy that East Timor has become for its population in the years since.

         —The opposition this afternoon wants to turn to the very serious implications of the government's decision to cancel DIFF projects, particularly those projects that are in the pipeline. When I say `the DIFF pipeline', they are projects in respect of which considerable investments have been made on the basis of bilateral agreements between Australia and our neighbours in these developing countries in our region.

        This is an issue which has preoccupied the attention of this House for most of this week. While we have been concentrating on the replies—the inadequacy of the replies—of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), insufficient attention has been given to the implications for the projects themselves.
       </para>
       <break page="3033" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         I say at the outset that we believe that what we have on our hands is extraordinarily bad policy. That bad policy decision was announced on the eve of the last election by the then opposition as part of their
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Meeting our commitments
         </emphasis>
         document. It is bad policy with serious implications for our regional relationships, for our very engagement in the region and for every one of the multitude of companies that have been involved in pursuing international opportunities under what has been an extraordinarily successful scheme, one that has done so much to give substance to our engagement in the region.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For the last few weeks I have had numerous approaches from company after company that has been involved in this process and that in some cases have had their businesses destroyed by what they have been quick to point out was an unbelievably bad decision, one that has in their case a retrospective effect.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are 52 projects in the DIFF pipeline. I want to start by dealing with them. They are projects involving not 52 companies but some 600 Australian companies, all told. Sixty per cent of all of these projects have been going now for at least 1&amp;half; to two years. These are all projects that have gone right through the feasibility study stage and the appraisal stage right through to the project design and detail stage.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are 52 projects, 60 per cent of which have been worked on for a period of years and in respect of which tens of millions of dollars have been expended in good faith, on the basis of bilateral relationships and on the basis of committed government policy. It was on this basis that an agreement was signed—the Deputy Speaker would be aware of this—between President Ramos of the Philippines and Australia at Williamtown to carry out a wide range of what are to the Philippines enormously important projects.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The estimate of the amount of money expended thus far on projects that have been arbitrarily cancelled is $67 million. In some cases, this means bankruptcy for the proponents. I repeat that proponents have acted in good faith. These people have been to see me and have told me of their dilemma. They have asked, `What do we say to our partners?'
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          There are partners involved in all these projects; 40 per cent of the projects have counterpart funding, where the recipients themselves have spent money in preparation. So it is not just at the Australian end; 40 per cent of those projects have seen money spent by our neighbours in pursuing the matter from their point of view.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         They ask, `What do we say to the people we are doing business with? How do we maintain our faith in the light of what the government has done, retrospectively'—as far as these projects are concerned—`wiping them out?' They ask, `What do we say to our bank manager, when we have spent $100,000, $200,000 and $300,000?' It is often small Australian companies, which have been out there doing their best as part of Australia's export drive, asking, `What do we say to our bank managers when we have no comeback, no recourse? Our project has been arbitrarily halted.'
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I have seen some bad policies, but I have never seen one that was less well thought through than this one—from a government that has been boasting about its commitment to small and medium Australian companies. It is really quite astonishing that a policy like this could be brought out on the eve of an election but not reviewed post&amp;hyphen;election once the implications of the abolition of DIFF, as far as projects in the pipeline are concerned, became known.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I can only put this down to the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is principally responsible for this, has not, from the very first moment, taken the implications seriously. He has not taken them seriously as far as these companies are concerned; he has not taken them seriously as far as our regional relations are concerned; he has not taken them seriously as far as the blow that it represents to our engagement in the region is concerned. He has been all too smart in passing it off as something that is a mere storm in a teacup. Day after day in the parliament over these last days he has stood here telling the House that this is not of any real importance. When he was not being absolutely evasive, he was being worse.

          As far as these projects are concerned, the House should be aware that the overwhelming majority of them involve enormously worthwhile projects. As far as the 17 in China are concerned, the Chinese government takes the view—I think quite properly—that they are the subject of a formal agreement between Australia and China. They are used to those formal agreements having the force of law. They take a very dim view of an Australian government which comes along and says that unless there is a contract individually committed by an Australian company—in other words, unless you have gone right through the feasibility study stage and through to the development of all the project detail stages—and unless you have actually signed a contract, then this can be retrospectively cancelled.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Chinese government—I think quite properly—says that those things are between government and government and they should proceed. And, of course, they have all been wiped out. When you look at the individual projects, you see projects that go to the very core of poverty alleviation and the easing of distress in developing countries, whether it be water improvement, sanitation improvement, environmental monitoring—a whole range of projects aimed at lifting the living standards, of improving the circumstances in these fast-growing nations.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is that problem that the House must be aware of, and it is that problem which the Minister for Foreign Affairs has delegated to his parliamentary secretary to handle. It is really quite an extraordinary decision for a government to cancel, retrospectively, 52 different projects coming under agreements between our neighbours and ourselves, involving $67 million worth of money privately expended already, and for the handling of that matter to be delegated to the parliamentary secretary, a parliamentary secretary who has not given any satisfaction whatsoever to the proponents of the individual DIFF projects when they have beaten a path to his door. It is fair to point out that they have been denied access to the minister himself. This has all been dealt with by pushing it down the line to the parliamentary secretary.

           I think this gives some sort of a flavour of what has really happened here. The DIFF project has not been properly and seriously considered by the government and it has fallen in a hole accordingly. Indeed, it has not been helped by the fact that the government has gone out of its way to say of late that it is to do with its invented budgetary black hole, whereas the House knows full well that this was part of its

No&amp;hyphen;one minds the government deciding to review aid and come down with their own scheme, but you must not do it retrospectively. You must not do that and brush to one side the very legitimate criticisms of everyone from ACCI, to the MTIA, to the Premier of Victoria, to those of us on this side of the House, to business large and small, to all our regional—

         —I thought there would be a censure motion. In fact, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) thought there would be a censure motion. In fact, most of our side thought there would be a censure motion this afternoon. I saw the Prime Minister down here at the dispatch box taunting the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and asking would he bring the censure motion on immediately or would he wait until after question time. But no—no censure motion. So the week ends not with a bang but with a whimper—a whimper indeed. So much so that, in his wisdom, my esteemed boss, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), has sent me down to defend what is a mere MPI and not a censure motion.

        When he answered a question today from one of the members of the opposition, he described this—for the second or third time this week—as a `monumental beat&amp;hyphen;up'. When you look at the terms of the MPI from the honourable member from Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), you see the adjectival phrase `the enormous damage' arising from the government's decision to abolish the development import finance facility. So we can say that the honourable gentleman has set the high jump bar very high this week.

         —It is not my job to make noise during question time, such as seems to be your role, my friend. With that said, in paying attention to what the member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith said during his speech on this MPI, I note he used another phrase in describing—or misdescribing it—our decision: `extraordinarily bad policy with extremely serious consequences'. As he sat there next to the great bulk of the Leader of the Opposition, that phrase put me in mind of that honourable gentleman. What he could only be describing was what we have christened, and which has had great resonance in the electorate, as Beazley's black hole.

       <para first-indent="16">
        But it is my opinion—and I think it is the opinion of the electorate—that for the honourable gentleman from Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith to describe this decision as causing `enormous damage' is quite ludicrous. In my opinion, it is exaggerated, it is far&amp;hyphen;fetched and it is nonsense. It is quite true, as the minister has pointed out, that there have been representations from the recipient governments which were to benefit under the DIFF scheme, but to describe it as `enormous damage' is, as I say, quite far&amp;hyphen;fetched. Furthermore, in asking this week for members on our side to make apologies, it may be more appropriate for our side of the House to ask your side to deliver us an apology for what the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has described as `the intergenerational theft' of Beazley's black hole.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It was the opposition when it was in government that so misspent this country's finances that we have a black hole that we are required to fill. It puts me in mind of a bank robber emerging from a bank pleading victimisation and saying that it was the fault of the depositors who put the money in the bank; or, perhaps more appropriate, the firebug who was caught emerging from the blazing factory to say, `Well, it wasn't my

       <para first-indent="16">
        But, when you come to ask yourself whether this decision we have made to abolish DIFF will cause the enormous damage to our reputation in this part of the world that the honourable gentleman claimed, you must recall what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said when he pointed out that it is quite false to describe our whole foreign policy in this part of the world as hinging on one aid scheme. He pointed out that the depth of our relationships with the various countries in this region—in particular, the countries that were to benefit under the DIFF scheme—is many and varied. It is deep. It goes from the memories of students who have studied in Australia to the memories of individuals in a poor village in a part of China, Vietnam, the Philippines or Indonesia who were the beneficiaries of a more basic delivery, perhaps by an Australian NGO.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        You cannot describe validly the abolition of this scheme as somehow destroying our entire reputation in this region. It is quite ludicrous to imagine that the abolition of just one scheme in our entire aid program—eight per cent of it—should somehow rend asunder all the goodwill that has built up for Australia in this region in the past 40 years since aid has been flowing. What I would like to ask the House to consider is that our decision to abolish this part of the aid budget, and to save thereby eight per cent, was made as a result of priorities that we determined. When we looked at the entire aid budget and when we looked at the sort of aid that was being delivered, we made a decision in opposition—and we hold to it in government—that aid should take on a more humanitarian face.

         Hence, when we looked at the entire aid budget and saw how much of it was locked in by legal commitments under treaties and other such things, we found that there was less discretion than we perhaps had first thought. Hence, when we had to set ourselves a set of priorities, we felt that there was nothing wrong with having the altruism to say that we should concentrate more on the basic aid that I know my friends, the member for Chifley (Mr Price) and the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), would prefer rather than leave intact a scheme that provided subsidies to business.

          —What an extraordinary thing. Not only is the member for Chifley not in his usual seat but he is also interjecting in a riotous fashion. Let us look at the sorts of Australian companies this scheme was directed at. In the beginning it went largely to big companies, some subsidiaries in Australia of multinational companies, but lately it is true to say that it was acquiring more of a flavour whereby smaller companies would participate.

         Simply saying that such smaller companies were to be the beneficiaries of some of these projects illustrates the fact that there are many other small companies in Australia which  were never going to benefit under DIFF or any other scheme that the Commonwealth, or any of the state governments, might provide. So the argument about fairness arises and whether it is fair to single out companies in a specific sector of the Australian economy
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          and provide a subsidy scheme for them to participate in spoiled markets—that is, markets where infrastructure projects are sought after by companies from other countries, as honourable members on the other side pointed out, such as Japan, Germany, France in particular, Finland and some others.

         Our problem in this country is that our real interest rates are far too high.

         So, in trying to restore some rectitude to the Commonwealth budget, the aim of this—which we seem to be achieving a little sooner than we might have otherwise anticipated through red hot competition among banks—is lower real interest rates.

        The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has damaged his credibility in Asia by abolishing a concessional credit aid scheme, according to the former head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Richard Woolcott. The Federal Government's decision to scrap the Development Import Finance Facility would undermine Australian credibility, offend neighbouring governments and harm Australian competitiveness, according to Mr Woolcott.

        That matter is put to the foreign minister in the course of question time and we find the publicity which follows: `Downer dismisses axed aid criticism'. When those matters were put to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the House, he dismissed the criticisms of DIFF by Mr Woolcott saying, `He was a consultant to one of the beneficiaries of the concessional credit scheme.' We see the appropriate headline in the

        Third, my concerns about scrapping the DIFF were much wider than the interests of a number of Australian companies . . .

        So I give Mr Woolcott the courtesy of reading that into the record so at least he gets something after having been the subject of a blackguarding by the parliamentary secretary. This is not the first occasion on which we have seen the parliamentary secretary—who has now gone from blackguarding to the bunker—trying to besmirch public officials or people of high standing in this way. `RBA cleared over insider trading claims'—this is the same man who alleged that RBA officers were guilty of insider trading. We are pleased to see him go from blackguarding officers to the bunker.

        The second area of great damage to parliamentary and ministerial standards has been the conduct of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I think this is the killer punch, but it takes a lot of blows to parliamentary and ministerial standards to get this bloke down. In question time on the 18th in response to a question from the member for Kingsford-Smith he said:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The fact is that of course some officials who are involved in the details of these programs have raised issues with my department, and you would not expect otherwise. But if this was a serious issue in our relationships they would raise it at the ministerial level. They would be writing me letters.
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        This is question time on the 18th. In his statement yesterday he said:

        I was made aware before 18 June that a letter would come from Dr Habibie . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        So he knew when he came to question time on the 18th, he knew when he said expressly, `They would be writing me letters,' that they
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         were. That is why his misleading of the House ought to see the Prime Minister sack him. If the Prime Minister has any interest in standards, the foreign minister ought to be sacked.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The parliamentary secretary has had a role in this. He has been very sheepish and very quiet and has gone back to the bunker. Why? Because we know he was the person who received the Habibie letter. It would be nice if he had stayed in here, rather than skulking away, to answer the question: when did he give it to his minister? On the Tuesday or before? On the 18th or before? Before question time or after question time?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let us take the benevolent view and say that the letter arrived subsequently. Maybe it means that the parliamentary secretary just cannot get the mail through. The cartoon in today's
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        was drawn to my attention when I was looking at Mr Woolcott's letter. In addition to the

        letter that I have referred to, he wrote also to the

       <para first-indent="16">
        Even if you take the extraordinarily benevolent view of ministerial standards and misleading the House that the Prime Minister does, the foreign minister has to be sacked on the basis that we are now walking around saying to our regional neighbours and internationally that we have a foreign minister who, if he does read, can't remember or, if he doesn't read, pretends. These are extraordinary standards for the Prime Minister to accept.

        The third area of enormous damage to ministerial and parliamentary standards is the conduct of the Deputy Prime Minister. When I first raised in this House the issue of DIFF and its implications for trade, he said, `Nothing to do with me.' Yesterday I asked him whether any matters had been raised with him. He said, `Yes. By minor officials, President of the Philippines and the foreign minister on 22 April.' I then asked him:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

        </break>
       </para>
       <para>
        He said, `Look at the cables.' He would not tell us the conversations he had had with the foreign minister because he knew that if he said yes he would shop his mate and if he said no people would say, `What sort of trade minister are you?' We have a Deputy Prime Minister who either will not tell the House the conversations he has had alerting the foreign minister to DIFF complaints or takes such an interest in our bilateral and trade matters that he forgets as well.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I noticed that in his disclosure returns the Deputy Prime Minister did remember that the Philippines President had given him a free helicopter ride. He could remember the free helicopter ride, but he couldn't remember, or he won't tell, whether the representations that had been made by the President were relayed to his parliamentary colleague, who he says is responsible for DIFF.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Deputy Prime Minister stands condemned for that but, more importantly, he sat here for five parliamentary days, from 18 June, knowing that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had misled the House. Did he do anything? Did he draw it to attention? Did he tell the Prime Minister? Or did he sit on his hands? He sat on his hands and he is condemned for that as well.

It is true that when you change any program you are going to get some reaction from other countries. It is on that that I think this debate should have been concentrated today, and I will say a little bit about it.

        Looking across the breadth of Australia's aid program, it has always worried me that we seem to be absolutely committed to our multilateral programs. When it comes to bilateral programs, where I have always felt Australia got so much more benefit, we find it easier, if there is a budget cut or some adjustment to be made, to let those bilateral programs suffer. As to the spread of the bilateral programs and their application, there has always been a problem knowing whether or not we get full value from them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have moved more often than not on the humanitarian aid programs. We certainly have been extraordinarily generous in the way in which, in particular countries, we provide not only project aid but also budget aid. Look at New Guinea for an example. It has always concerned me that that country, in spite of the money we have given them, does not yet seem to be able to address some of the fundamental questions of administration. If you turn further afield, you see that Australia has
        <break page="3042" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         provided, from governments of either persuasion, a significant contribution towards the wellbeing of individuals. The major emphasis of our bilateral programs has always been on those who are poor and those whose need is greatest. Really that is what this debate this afternoon is about.

        Should there be, in any analysis of the Australian aid program, a reappraisal which puts the development import finance facility above other elements in the aid concept? As far as the multilateral programs are concerned, I am one of those who still feels very sceptical about whether, through the World Bank, the Asia Development Bank or any other of those multilateral agencies, Australia gets, in full dollar value, a return in terms of its international standing, its trade opportunities and opportunities for services exports of the value it does out of other aspects of its aid.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We set up AusAID in its various forms—AIDAB before it became AusAID—in order to ensure there could be a proper appraisal of the individual bilateral programs. While we do have an opportunity to get some input in multilateral programs, more often than not, as an inquiry which I was involved in a little while ago resolved, it is up to Australian business to get off its backside and do something about it rather than just the government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If we are going to get more value out of our multilateral programs, Australian business needs to be far more aggressive than it has been. There is something that can be done to get value out of multilateral programs. It is not really satisfactory that, when there is to be a reduction in our overall aid, we decide that we are going to cut only in the field of bilateral aid. I think multilateral programs give us less return more often than the bilateral programs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If you start looking at and analysing what is included in the whole content of that very large sum of money that the Australian taxpayer provides each year to assist the disadvantaged around the world, I cannot say that I believe the development import finance facility should have priority over those programs that are designed specifically to help those countries which are less fortunate, to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         help those who are either poor or totally disadvantaged.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The trouble is that it is always difficult in major projects, such as most of those within the DIFF concept, to have the tap turned off. As soon as you do so, you know that there has been a pipeline which is fairly extensive and that somebody is going to suffer. It is in that context that there is a certain adverse result in Australia having decided it could not afford to maintain the total content of its aid program.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Having registered and accepted that, we need to see to the maximum how we can develop our aid program better in the future. While it is not specifically related to this matter of public importance, I think what we need to do at this stage is to look across the breadth of the performance and at where we are going for the future. I hope in the budget of 20 August that there might be consideration given by the government to the total content of both multilateral and bilateral programs. Unless there is, I do not think we are going to get the value that Australia needs for whatever funds we can allocate to aid.

        In terms of particular country aid, it worries me that in a country so close to us and where there is a particular problem at the moment—that is, in Papua New Guinea, and in particular in Bougainville—there are large sums of money available that are not being spent. When that happens one wonders just how we can overcome the disability. Indeed, if you have a look at the crisis in Bougainville, one of the real concerns there is the delivery of aid, not just the provision of funds. Unless we can do something about ensuring that our aid is delivered, it means that no value is generated either for the recipient country or for the donor. Equally, the same applies to aid in other areas.

        Part of my worry with the DIFF program has been that the long-term benefit and recognition of Australia's contribution is likely to be minimal. I have been to a number of bridges—without specifically identifying where they are—in the eastern provinces of Indonesia. I notice the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) is in the House; he was with me at the time. Some of those
        <break page="3043" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         bridges were constructed by Australia under earlier aid programs, and you would have no idea they were built by Australia. That is part of the problem. Our difficulty is: to what degree do we provide aid to help Australia, or to what degree do we provide aid in order to better the conditions of the countries who receive that aid, and to what degree do we expect in the long term to get some type of return from it?
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To my mind the benefits should be, first, in the recognition that Australia has been a generous and willing neighbour; secondly, that we make sure we develop friendship and understanding, which hopefully might add to a better political dialogue; and, thirdly, that we make sure we help to overcome the abject poverty which tragically is apparent in so many other countries and continents.

        We want to try to do our best internationally to make sure that we are seen as a responsible international citizen.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There has been, of course, a rejection of our decision to withdraw the funds by those countries which were going to receive some benefit. I hope that some of these programs might in some way be reincorporated, because I do recognise that infrastructure development is tremendously important.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Indeed, it was quite interesting the other day to note in an Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's report the trend downwards in infrastructure development within our own country. One of the problems that every country must face is the development of the infrastructure to enable people's living standards to be as high as they possibly can be. But to suggest, as this MPI does, that because we have abolished one element alone of our total aid program there has been enormous damage is absolute rubbish.

        These amendments, which have been circulated, were debated earlier today in the Main Committee. Today the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian
        </emphasis>
        carried an article quoting the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) in a speech he made to this House earlier this week. The article said that a showdown is looming between the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the minister. In that article there were statements made that the current chairman of the board regarded certain statements made by the minister as defamatory.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The minister said elsewhere earlier today that he wants a cohesive and cooperative relationship with the airline industry. I put to members that that published article in the newspaper today and the statements of the minister show a direct conflict between the minister and the board. That is not a board with which he had anything to do with and an organisation of which he was quite critical during his period in opposition. He admits that he did attack the board in the statement to the House earlier this week. I ask: what is the relationship between him and the board of CASA and does he enjoy the confidence of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the board or does the board have any confidence in the minister?

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think it is vitally important to have people with experience and expertise guiding the fortunes of our airline industry. I think it is essential that the board that regulates the industry be made up of people with exceptional expertise and certainly a background in the aviation industry.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I do not accept the argument that we can have people on the board who are consumer advocates, for instance, people who may have a theory about airline efficiency but certainly no qualifications in regard to airline safety. I make no comment on the personality or the integrity of those board members. I do not know them. I do know from reports that Gabi Hollows is a wonderful lady who has contributed enormously to Australian society, but I do not believe she has anything like the qualifications required for this board.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Everything I said in my earlier speech in the Main Committee and everything the minister said in his speech in there supports my amendments. I believe that he was winding up to an endorsement of those amendments when he was speaking, such was the rapport between his words and mine in an earlier speech, but he then said that those amendments touch on other statutory bodies. They may do, but I do not see any fear necessary about this particular one. We are not talking about the ABC; we are not talking about any other statutory board; we are talking about the air safety board—the one that determines the safety of airline operations in Australia.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I did speak earlier about a crash near my electorate in October 1993 involving two people, one of whom I knew. Those people survived for several days—at least 48 hours in one case and up to 15 days, I understand, in the other. But for the need of an electronic transmitter locater, a portable one, they may well have survived. CASA has refused to endorse such a locater up until this time. There was some indication from the minister that that may be about to change, but I ask why that was not endorsed as a matter of course far earlier than this.

         The minister is not satisfied that CASA fully responded to the report into the DC3 crash in Botany Bay in 1994. That again, to my mind, is an indication of the fact that perhaps there are forces dictating to the board, other than the board determining for itself what its reaction to reports might be. Does it have the expertise and is it getting the sort of information it requires? I think the minister has made it patently obvious he wants a new board. I think we should give him that opportunity. It is no good waiting until we review these boards down the track. This is airline safety we are talking about.

         —In seconding these amendments, I must say that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) sought this aviation portfolio. That was certainly a courageous decision, because it is a portfolio which is fraught with a lot of trouble. It seems to me that, if the minister is going to accept responsibility, as he must, for the actions of his portfolio, he must be able to have absolute faith in its personnel.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is quite clear the minister does not have that absolute faith. I know, and it is a matter of record, he sought the resignation of the board. They all agreed, bar the chairman. I think the chairman is to be condemned for that, because I do not think the chairman had any right to refuse that quite reasonable request from the new minister. I think the chairman's action goes very much to the arrogance of the judiciary, which I have been becoming increasingly concerned about. So it is a very simple scenario. It is a very simple equation. The minister is expected to take responsibility for the actions of the board. He cannot be expected to do that if he himself cannot determine who the board is.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What we are seeing here with the decision to extend the board is that, firstly, it is very expensive and, secondly, it is simply a measure put in place to try to give the minister some semblance of confidence in that board. I think it follows absolutely that, if the minister is to take responsibility, he should have the power to appoint the board. To suggest that this goes to other portfolios, firstly, I think is drawing a longbow and,
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para>
         secondly, I do not see any reason why it should not be, and I can think of other areas where the minister is expected to take responsibility. This responsibility covers matters of life and death in some cases so yes, of course the minister of the day should have that power. So I think this is a very sensible amendment and a very necessary one. We hope that we would get the support of the House in pursuing it.

        The honourable member for Calare made the particular point about ELTs, and I would agree with him about that. I think the process of ensuring people are properly equipped in case of an accident in such a way that they can be found quickly is a very important one. A portable ELT, as opposed to a permanently fixed ELT, is certainly a proposition that I believe has a lot of merits.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        With respect to the incident that the honourable member for Calare referred to where two people died—one of whom he knew—the aircraft had a fixed ELT, but the aircraft burnt, as I recall, and the ELT was destroyed in the fire. Those people survived—one of them survived up to 15 days. Had he had a portable ELT, he could have taken that with him and been located very quickly, and both persons would have survived to this day. So there is a very strong argument for portable ELTs, which I think is one of the main thrusts of the member for Calare's speech.

        I also refer to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie's comments and thank him very much for some of the sentiments that he expressed there.

So I agree with that aspect of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie's comments.

Those are the two aspects of the amendments that the honourable member for Calare has put forward to the House today.

         —The opposition does not oppose the extension of the number of members of the board from five to seven, as is proposed in the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill, and therefore does not support the first amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren). We also do not support the second amendment moved by the honourable member for Calare. That amendment would, in effect, render meaningless the whole basis of statutory authorities and the boards which govern those authorities, because they are intended to be at arms length from the day-to-day political process and not subject to direct ministerial whim, otherwise the authority might as well be part of the department.

        The amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Calare would, in effect, put the minister in a position whereby the board could be subject to instant dismissal for no reason and, therefore, might just as well be part of the department. In fact, it would probably put the board in a more vulnerable position than that which it would be in if it were part of the department. It would also raise some big question marks about how these matters would be dealt with in other statutory authorities, both within the portfolio of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and in other areas.

         I have two very quick comments to make with respect to the matters that have been raised. The first relates to ELTs. Yes, the opposition accepts that, in certain circumstances, hand&amp;hyphen;held ELTs will perform a life&amp;hyphen;saving function which fixed ELTs will not perform. But the opposition would say that the reverse is also true: there are certain circumstances in which a fixed ELT may assist in saving lives whereas a hand&amp;hyphen;held ELT may not.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I said in debate here a day or two ago, I hope very sincerely, for the minister's sake, that we do not have a situation arise after this ordinance is gazetted where the reverse situation to that which the honourable member for Calare adverted to in his speech occurs and people die as a result of not having a fixed ELT in a plane that goes down in a remote area.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition believes that it is inappropriate for the minister to intervene directly and to countermand the position of his authority on this issue. Evidence has come to my attention only today that the technical officers in CASA have recommended very strongly that the organisation should stick with its position with respect to the fixed ELTs regulation and not switch to allowing hand&amp;hyphen;held ELTs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second matter I wish to refer to is the extraordinary behaviour of the minister in relation to the CASA board. He now appears to be engaging in warfare by press release with the chairperson of the board. Irrespective of his views on the behaviour of the board and what may or may not be occurring, it is extraordinary that, as a minister of the Crown, he is choosing to pursue these issues by press release. One would have thought that, if he did have these concerns, he would be able to pursue them through proper ministerial channels. He is no longer the shadow minister; he is now the minister.

         It is remarkable that he seeks to pursue this vendetta by press release. It does the organisation no good.

        I turn to a couple of points that have been raised by the opposition. Despite the fact that they claim that there should be no right of the minister to dismiss a board, I point out again that a situation has arisen between the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and this board which certainly does nothing to give anybody travelling by air any feeling of security. While ever we are engaged in this slanging match—and there must be residual bitterness involved—it must impede any sound judgment on just what is and is not delivered to the minister, what advice is accepted from the staff of CASA and how effective the whole operation is.

        People have mentioned that Dick Smith is wanting to get back on to this board. I have no truck with anybody who has been suggested as a potential board member. I doubt that the minister has. His stance is to get a board that he believes in, that has got the confidence of the industry. I am arguing from the point of view of that industry and from the point of view of local operators.

        The minister did say that it will be a major tragedy if the only thing that happens is that the shingle on the front door changes, in reference to the CASA organisation having changed its former status and the same personnel essentially being there. That major tragedy metaphor may come back to haunt the minister and all of us if decisive action is not

         —I wish to refer to some of the comments made by the opposition spokesman, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), in regard to the so-called press release war that he alleges is occurring between the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and me. I make the point—he would be well aware of this—that I made a ministerial statement in the House on Tuesday afternoon, which is a most appropriate thing for a minister to do. It is something that dropped off during the last few years of the previous Labor government. They were the sorts of people who, rather than make an appropriate statement in the House, would actually put out press releases.

        I was making a ministerial statement following the Monarch coronial inquiry—the final presentation of that report. As did the coroner in the Monarch case, I made criticisms of the old CAA—I referred those criticisms to the new body, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority—and I made criticisms of the current CASA. Justice Fisher, who was the Chairman of CASA, decided off his own bat to put out a press release yesterday afternoon criticising me for criticising CASA. He said it was almost defamatory of me to make those sorts of criticisms. I make the point that I, as the minister, take the responsibility for what goes on in aviation safety in this country.

        I believe that, in order to fulfil that task properly, I need at times to pass on criticisms, to make criticisms, and also to give praise where it is due. For the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to say that I do not have the right to make criticisms of CASA is a serious misjudgment on his behalf. I will continue to make criticisms where I believe they are appropriate.

        I would make the point, as I did in the Main Committee earlier today, that his press release—which is not the first such press release he has chosen to put out—contradicts totally the letter he wrote to me in April this year, which said that he would give me complete loyalty and give the government
        <break page="3049" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         loyalty. He used this expression of loyalty as justification for his continuing in his role as chairman of that organisation.

         —Just very briefly: the minister is being too cute by half. The matter which caused the chairperson of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to put out a media statement was the minister's assertion in his ministerial statement that he—that is the chairperson—and his fellow board members were placing their own interests ahead of the interests of aviation safety in Australia by refusing to resign. That was the accusation which he described as being almost defamatory; that was the thing which provoked his response. It is pretty extraordinary that the minister is demanding or asking for loyalty on the part of somebody against whom he has made such an accusation and where that accusation has not been substantiated in any way, shape or form.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, I think your warning is very sound. The member who has just spoken, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), makes an absolute case for giving the minister power to remove the board. It is quite clear there is no confidence there. This board is going to lurch from crisis to crisis. It is much better that this amendment be adopted. My colleague the member for Calare (Mr Andren) and I both feel strongly about this. This is the only way that this matter is going to be resolved.

I believe that civil aviation regulations should not put anything like as much pressure as they do on owner pilots or people flying with their families. There should be less concern with general aviation charter business—and I would charter more than anyone else in this House. I make no assessment of who is safe and who is not.

        It is quite clear that these judgments have to be made. It is overwhelmingly clear from what the spokesman for the opposition has said that the minister does have to be in a position to have confidence in that board. Whatever the reason is, that does not exist now. There are going to be ongoing sniping and virtual warfare between the board and the minister. That is not conducive to safety or for legislation to ensure safety. This amendment of ours is very important. The minister should think twice about it and perhaps have a little more intestinal fortitude and not be driven by his department so much.

         —by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the fourth annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum, held in Cha&amp;hyphen;Am, Phetchaburi Province, Kingdom of Thailand from 15 to 18 January 1996. As I have reported previously to this House, the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum very much had its genesis in the work of members of this House, along with the chairman of that organisation, the very distinguished former Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Nakasone.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It was my predecessor as Speaker in this House, the member for Watson, the Hon. Mr Leo McLeay MHR, who was very much involved in originally establishing this organisation. When I was Speaker of the House, and in the course of the last three years, I had taken a very strong interest in ensuring that the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum achieved what I consider to be some very valuable and reasonable outcomes.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This particular meeting was one of significance because it followed on from decisions taken previously, at the behest of Australia, that the actual administration arrangements associated with this forum be put in place and be put on a much stronger footing.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think there was a perception when it was originally established that it was simply an opportunity for parliamentarians from the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region to get together and perhaps have a round of golf—a little bit of golf
        <break page="3051" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         diplomacy; occasionally that does not go astray. Then they would sit down for a couple of hours, have a yarn and it was all over, red rover. I think that has changed. It has changed dramatically and for the better. Mr Nakasone is to be commended for his drive and initiative in that. The Australian parliamentary delegations that have gone to both the executive committee meetings and, most recently, to the actual forum itself have played a real role.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Our delegation at this last meeting was led by Ben Humphreys, the former member for Griffith in Queensland. The deputy leader of the delegation was the new Speaker, the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), and other members of the delegation were Senator Bryant Burns and the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay).
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I record the thanks of our delegation to Mr Peter Gibson, Assistant Secretary (Committees) in the Department of the House of Representatives, who was the delegation secretary and, importantly, to Mr Lyn Barlin, Clerk of the House of Representatives and Bronwyn Allan, the Executive Officer of the Australian National Group of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum. I also thank our diplomatic representatives in Thailand, particularly Cavan Hogue, the Ambassador, and Antoinette Merrillees, the Second Secretary. All those people played a very real and pivotal role in ensuring the success of this delegation. I was delighted that the now Speaker was able to accompany us on that delegation, because it gave him an insight into the way in which this forum operates. I would hope it will have his support for the future.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The issues which were discussed in our meeting in Cha&amp;hyphen;Am went to some very important issues, and a communique was issued at the conclusion of the conference. We talked about the political and security issues that continue to face the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region, and a number of delegations took the opportunity in the forum to talk about the South China sea matter. There was a great deal of discussion about anti&amp;hyphen;nuclear issues, because members will recall that, at the time, the French were still conducting tests in the Pacific Ocean. There was some real concern about
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         expressing views about that in the conference. We also talked about regional cooperation in the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region and a number of other issues, including terrorism, drug abuse, trafficking, money laundering, the protection of children and children's rights, the protection of women's rights, AIDS, cooperation and the sharing of natural resources. All these issues were covered in a very reasoned and reasonable way.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is all well and good for larger countries in the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region and those that have well advanced forms of parliamentary democracy to, perhaps, occasionally sit back and consider that they are the only ones that should participate in forums of this nature—that they, in some way, have a mortgage on all the wisdom that goes into forums of this nature. That is certainly not the case with the APPF. One of the great benefits on this occasion was the fact that representatives at a very senior level from smaller nations—some 25 or 26 of them now make up the APPF—took the chance to speak. That, in itself, was one of the more pleasing features of the forum.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I made passing reference to the fact that some very distinguished members of various parliaments participated. At the time, I was a member of the executive committee and I held the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives. But I think it is important to note that we had a number of other speakers or deputy speakers from various parliaments as leaders of their delegations. There was a very large representation from the Thai parliament itself. At this stage, I extend to the Thai parliament the congratulations of Australia for their organisational abilities, as expressed in the forum. It really was an outstanding success in charm. It was an outstanding success because of the way in which members and staff of the Thai parliament went out of their way to ensure that all the delegations were well looked after and that the forum ran very smoothly.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It was more than a talkfest, and I think there were some valuable outcomes. The particular communique that was adopted has, in fact, been sent to the United Nations and all the host parliaments. When the next of
        <break page="3052" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         these meetings rings around, there will be a report&amp;hyphen;back mechanism from the parliaments to see how the resolutions adopted in Cha&amp;hyphen;Am have been adopted by a number of parliaments.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I thank all the people who, in the last three years when I had the opportunity to be the chair of the Australian National Group of the APPF, contributed so much to its growth and its importance in our region. I said at the time that I had the belief that the APPF had the potential to be one of the premier parliamentary forums in the world. There is the IPU and there is the CPA, and now there is the APPF. Given that the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region is the fastest growing economically, given our engagement in the Asia&amp;hyphen;Pacific region, which was, I guess, brought home very passionately and clearly by the former government and which, I am pleased to see, is being embraced by the new government—given all those reasons, I think that this parliament deserves to continue to press on with the very pivotal role it plays in the APPF. I would hope that at some stage in the future I can continue to play a role within it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I commend the report to all honourable members. I thank the new Speaker for his interest in the APPF. I know he will maintain that interest. I know that he will play a very real role in ensuring that Australia's views continue to be heard in this forum and that we continue the process of encouragement to some of our smaller neighbours not only to go to this forum but also to play a real role by contributing papers and speaking at the forum itself. I thank honourable members for giving me the opportunity to table this report.

        It is just over four years since the High Court delivered its historic judgment in Mabo v. Queensland (No. 2). That case decided for the first time that indigenous Australians have native title rights in relation to land that are recognised by the common law. The judgment challenged our legal and parliamentary systems to provide a framework to protect and respect those rights, while at the same time providing certainty for all Australians and enabling economic development to proceed.

        In 1993 the coalition took the view that the Native Title Bill was inadequate to address the uncertainties following the High Court's decision. But we did not, and do not, reject the Mabo judgment and its principles. We support the principles of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. We believe that a national approach, involving the Commonwealth, the states and the territories, is the only way to address native title issues.

         The 1995 High Court decision in Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission held invalid some determinative functions of the commission. The judgment suggests that some determinative functions which were intended to be carried out by the National Native Title Tribunal should now be carried out by the Federal Court.

         The recent High Court decision in North Ganalanja Aboriginal Corporation v. Queensland in relation to the Waanyi claim, and the earlier decision of the Federal Court in Western Australia v. Lane in the Miriuwung Gajerrong claim, have demonstrated that the process for deciding whether native title claims should be accepted and registered is not operating effectively. The statutory benefit of the right to negotiate flows from the registration of a claim under the act. Following the Waanyi decision, the Native Title Registrar has been obliged to accept claims for determination even where they appear to have little merit, so long as they are `fairly arguable'. In practice, this means that any claim which raises an issue which has not been definitively settled can be accepted, even if it is most unlikely to succeed. In this government's view, the current law does not appropriately balance the interests of all parties involved.

         The lack of precedent on substantive native title issues has had an impact on the mediation processes established by the act for handling claims. Parties have been unwilling to agree on an outcome when, in the absence of judicial authority, there is little clarity as to their legal rights. This has meant that the negotiation and mediation processes have not produced agreements in the way it was hoped. The lack of outcomes has produced frustration among both indigenous and non&amp;hyphen;indigenous people. To some extent this has been exacerbated by a lack of guidance in the act itself as to the purpose and scope of mediation. There

          The government intends to address all the issues considered in the outline paper released in May this year. However, this bill does not contain all of the measures described in that paper as the government's `proposed amendments'. It became obvious early in the consultation process that some proposals would be of much greater interest to, and have a greater impact upon, interest groups than would others. In particular, the right to negotiate provisions and the proposals to impose statutory rights and obligations on representative Aboriginal&amp;hyphen;Torres Strait Islander bodies are the subject of detailed submissions to the government and ongoing consultation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The government welcomed the initiative of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation for organising the meetings of key interested parties such as the Minerals Council of Australia, the National Farmers Federation, various land councils, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, and the representatives of a number of representative bodies in establishing working groups to develop proposals in response to the outline paper.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The government also welcomes the constructive contribution from the states and territories which must live with the act on a day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day basis and have intricate knowledge of its workings and deficiencies. We welcome the constructive way in which all interested

          To include those proposals in the bill would have pre&amp;hyphen;empted consultations on these key issues, and would have left insufficient time for serious consideration of the submissions made in response to the deadline for submissions of 18 June 1996. The government will therefore move amendments to this bill in the budget session to deal with the right to negotiate provisions in the act and with the role and responsibilities of representative bodies. There may well be other issues which emerge during that consultation process which need to be addressed at that time.

All parties have had an opportunity to consider the outline paper, and they will of course have the opportunity to consider and fully debate the bill, including the amendments I have mentioned.

          Item 39 of schedule 1 will insert a new section 86A into the act to spell out the purposes of mediation in native title cases. We recognise that the lack of relevant judicial precedents at this point means that most mediations are unlikely to produce complete agreement. We believe, however, that agreement on factual matters relating to an application should be possible. Such agreement can be an effective means of shortening Federal Court processes by relieving the court of the need to hear evidence on, and rule on, the facts in each case. The amendments seek to ensure that resources for mediation are used effectively and in those cases most likely to achieve partial or complete agreement.

          A key aspect of the improved workability of the act is the splitting of the consideration of a claim by the Federal Court from the registration of the claim on the Register of Native Title Claims.

          The current lack of an effective threshold test for access to the right to negotiate is an issue which must be addressed to maintain a proper balance between the interests of native title holders and the need to ensure that economic development is not unduly impeded.

           The Native Title Registrar must be satisfied that prima facie each of the elements of a claim can be made out before it can be registered. The registrar must also be satisfied as to a range of matters which have a bearing on whether a claim has a reasonable prospect of ultimate success. The registrar must take into account information provided by the relevant state or territory government as to whether the land is or was subject to freehold, or residential or commercial leasehold grants, and if it is, the claim will be ineligible for registration.

           Section 21 of the act is amended by part 3 of schedule 1 to deal with the situation where native title holders in relation to whom a determination of native title has been made are parties to a section 21 agreement and there is a later determination that other persons hold native title. The lack of other effective provisions to help parties reach agreements has been a major source of frustration with the act. There has been a corresponding overuse of the essentially adversarial processes of determination under the act.

            In part 6 of schedule 1 there are several amendments to clarify the acts that may be done validly in relation to leases, including pastoral leases. The basis on which the Native Title Bill was considered by this parliament was that native title did not survive the valid grant of a lease. This was the view of the High Court expressed in Mabo. Since then, the Commonwealth, and the states and territories, have argued in the courts, most recently in Wik Peoples v. Queensland two weeks ago, that native title does not survive the grant of a valid pastoral lease, whether or not that lease was subject to a reservation allowing access or use by indigenous peoples. As yet, however, there has been no definitive judicial determination of this issue.

Honourable members should remember that many native title holders are also placed in the position of having to go to court to prove and protect their interests in land, and that they too feel it is unfair that they should have to become involved in such legal proceedings.

        A number of the other proposed amendments are collectively concerned with the Department of Primary Industries and Energy's management of chemicals subject to import and export restrictions under international obligations such as the prior informed consent procedures. The obtaining of information about chemical products from the NRA is a factor in that management. The proposed amendments will not place any additional reporting burden on the chemical industry as the necessary information is already required to be provided to the NRA.

        Provision is also proposed for the NRA to be able to impose a fee for the issuing of certificates of export.

        The proposed amendments will apply to commercial debts forgiven after today, 27 June 1996, and not from 9 May 1995 which was the proposed commencement date announced by the former government. Under revised transitional arrangements, if forgiveness occurs after 27 June 1996 pursuant to an agreement or arrangement entered into on or before 27 June the forgiveness will not be affected by the amendments.

        The commercial debt forgiveness provisions will not affect the creditor's taxation entitlements. However, the total amount of debt forgiven in a year of income will be applied to reduce the debtor's entitlement to accumulated deductible losses and other amounts that would otherwise be taken into account in the future in calculating the debtor's taxable income. In certain circumstances, the net forgiven amount of a debtor which is a company will be apportioned among a group of companies related to the debtor company. The measures incorporate rules relating to the forgiveness of debts by a company forming part of a company group. Such provisions, which are anti&amp;hyphen;avoidance in nature, were foreshadowed but not introduced by the former government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The forgiveness of commercial debt measures will correct a structural weakness in the present law which does not properly tax the economic benefit to a taxpayer from being forgiven a debt. The present law creates scope for duplication of deductions in circumstances where the creditor would be entitled to tax relief for a loss on a debt that is forgiven or otherwise settled for less than full value.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Notwithstanding that the act of forgiveness relieves the debtor of the economic loss represented by the debt, tax losses that accumulated before the debt was terminated generally remain available to shield future income from taxation.

         to absorb future income after being acquired by new shareholders under arrangements that include the forgiveness of pre&amp;hyphen;existing debts.

The entity's ability to claim a deduction for expenses incurred as a result of investing in a PST or life policy is limited by the fact that any amount received upon redemption of units in a PST or surrender of a life policy is treated as tax exempt income.

        <para>
         Mr Deputy Speaker, we accept the amendments requested by the Senate. Essentially, what the amendments mean is that this legislation will now pass through the parliament. As we stated right at the beginning, we wanted to change the uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent. That is the case. We will achieve that. There will be a default uplift factor that remains, but it is now expressed as a formula. This amendment provides for a formula as a basis for setting the default provisional tax uplift factor.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The formula is based on ABS published figures for growth in nominal GDP terms. This formula is entirely consistent with the government's election commitment to ensure that the provisional tax uplift factor is set more in line with nominal growth in income. This is the position the government has been putting to the parliament all along, and we are committed to this position.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The formula operates by calculating a default uplift factor based on the year average growth in nominal GDP for the year to December preceding the relevant income year. Year average growth in nominal GDP to the December quarter is used as these figures usually become available in March of each year. The default factor will therefore be available to the parliament and taxpayers well before the beginning of the relevant year of income. The formula provides that the default factor will be rounded to the nearest whole number.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The parliament, of course, will still have the opportunity to set the provisional tax uplift factor each year, as currently applies. For example, in March next year the default factor for the 1997&amp;hyphen;98 year of income will be calculated as the percentage change year average growth in nominal GDP in the year to December 1996. For the 1996 income year
         <break page="3066" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the formula provides for a default uplift factor of 5.7 per cent, consistent with the factor set by the government of six per cent.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, this government is very supportive of businesses, private enterprise and people who are involved in profit making in this country, and I am sure that businesses will be keen to see this come into effect. I know that the opposition, in previous debates in the parliament today, have indicated that they are not supportive of private enterprise or people who are involved in profit making. We are supportive, as a government, and I am sure that this bill's coming into effect will be most welcome.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, it is absolutely absurd for the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) to tell this parliament that this is what the government has been trying to achieve all along. If that is true, Parliamentary Secretary, why did you not legislate it initially? Why has it taken a series of amendments moved by the Australian Labor Party in this place and a series of messages from the Senate for the government to see sense? The truth is, Mr Deputy Speaker, that what the government is doing tonight is correcting another Costello cock&amp;hyphen;up. What it is doing is correcting another failure by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to implement the election promises which he took to the Australian people on 2 March.

        In the other place, I think it is fair to say, what the government is trying to do is correct another instance where it has been caught short. Caught short! Senator Short, their bumbling Assistant Treasurer, has mismanaged this legislation from go to whoa. They are, of course, the Laurel and Hardy combination of financial management in this country—the Assistant Treasurer in the Senate and the Treasurer in this place.

        Every small business and every self&amp;hyphen;funded retiree in Australia knows the terms of the coalition's election promise, which were to institute an uplift factor on provisional tax of six per cent—not  six per cent for one year only, but six per cent full stop. The parliamentary secretary is not being completely open with the House when he suggests that
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the provision now before us was their intention all along. Their intention initially, Mr Deputy Speaker, was a permanent rate on uplift factor of 10 per cent. That was provided for in the legislation that the parliamentary secretary originally brought before this House.

        It has taken the Australian Labor Party, with the support of the minor parties in the Senate, to keep them honest. It has taken the Australian Labor Party to give them commonsense and some honesty on this measure. What we have tried to say is that a 10 per cent permanent rate—what the parliamentary secretary calls a default rate—is not consistent with their election promise, and the parliamentary secretary knows it full well, as does Senator Short. That is why they have had to bring this new provision before the Senate and now before the House. In the other place on 19 June Senator Short said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        What we said . . . is having a provisional tax uplift factor regime which sets the uplift factor each year at a level which is more in line with the nominal growth in the economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The nominal growth in the economy for the outyears could not possibly have been 10 per cent, so the coalition has been caught out in an act of deceit, an act of dishonesty, in trying to bring a 10 per cent permanent rate on uplift factor before this House. What they were attempting, of course, was a tax grab whereby they offered a fistful of dollars in year one to the value of $180 million. But then they ripped back $360 million in the following year and another $360 million in the year after that—a net loss for 800,000 provisional taxpayers in Australia of more than half a billion dollars.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Labor Party, happily, through this series of debates, has been able to circumvent the tax grab. We have been able to cut off the hands that were going to grab back, throughout the life of this parliament, more than half a billion dollars from all provisional taxpayers in the nation. It is a happy day for those taxpayers that the government has been kept honest and that it has seen some commonsense on this provision.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <break page="3067" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         But I warn the government that the Labor Party will remain vigilant on these matters, because we recognise that the new calcula tion, the formula that the parliamentary secretary brings before the House, is not perfect. It cannot be perfect because what we are talking about is an uplift projection for the outyears and what he is introducing is a calculation based on data which by its very nature is historical.

        So we recognise, and put the government on notice, that, as the economic cycle turns down—as it is bound to under this government with its low growth policies, its upward pressure on interest rates, its fiscal constraint contractionary impact on the macro&amp;hyphen;economy—the formula that the government is placing before the House will be overstated. The prospective rate and uplift factor that it is bringing forward according to this formula will be overstated. So as it pursues low growth policies we will be vigilant in making sure that provisional taxpayers around Australia are not punished for those policies.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We recognise that this formula, which provides for an outyear calculation based on nominal growth in GDPI—GDP measured by the income calculation—is a lot closer to your election promise than when you started out. It is a lot better than 10 per cent, it is a lot closer to six per cent, and it is to the lasting benefit of those 800,000 provisional taxpayers who this evening I am sure will be thanking the Australian Labor Party for its vigilance.

         —It is a bit rich for the coalition to attempt to justify—as it has attempted to do in the other place—suddenly having had a great revelation, and that what they intended, by leaving the matter in a position where from the financial year after this the provisional tax uplift factor would be at 10 per cent, is somehow suddenly not worth the candle.

        From a former life as a building contractor before I entered this place, I do understand the difference between escalation clauses and rise and fall clauses, and so does the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) at the

        We have the situation where it is all the government's way. I am not sure if the opposition has been snowed on this or understands what we are talking about but, if I understand item 9 on this piece of paper I have before me signed by the Clerk of the Senate, the formula works in such a way that when there is a decline in the GDPI it will have no effect whatsoever. In other words, whilst these provisions remain in force, it cannot go below six per cent. So if the GDPI, as is to be now applied over eight quarters, is to be the catalyst for subsequent adjustments, it only applies in the case of increases. It only applies if that formula gives us a result of more than six per cent, and I understand the rounding&amp;hyphen;off provision. If the formula gives us seven per cent or more, that will be the figure. But if it falls, as it very well could during the life of this parliament, to 4.5 per cent, bad luck. The self&amp;hyphen;funded retirees of this country are not going to get it both ways; they are only going to get it one way—in the neck.

        So I have a very serious reservation about what is now proposed, except that it has been agreed to in the Senate and it is better than the proposed 10 per cent after the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 financial year. But, in terms of equity, it has very few feathers to fly with. It is good enough to apply the formula in the case of an increase but not in the case of a decrease. I am sure there are not many reasonable people around Australia or in this room who could understand that. It is inequitable.

       <para first-indent="16">
        What they have done is what they have claimed to do, quite rightly and properly, and that is to set a minimum condition. It is a bit like their industrial relations legislation. They have underwritten the figure and it shall be six per cent and no less. It can be more, of course, but no less. I think that is playing with the situation. I do not think it has been canvassed in the Senate. I am not absolutely sure, since I am not an assiduous follower of what goes on there. But it is certainly better than what was proposed, and I accept and
        <break page="3068" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         acknowledge that if this amendment is not passed, the eight per cent figure imposed by the Labor Party, the previous government, will apply. Rather than be accused of depriving unincorporated small businesses and self&amp;hyphen;funded retirees in Australia of the lesser figure, I will go along with it, but I am not fooled by it. I sincerely suggest that the rest of Australia should not be either.

         —I will, Mr Deputy Speaker. The member for Curtin has raised a good point: if the percentage worked out under subsection 3 is negative it is, instead, zero per cent. What he is pointing out is that, if the economy contracts, even if inflation is low and nominal GDP growth is negative, there will be no benefit in this provision for provisional taxpayers. They are going to have an increase in their uplift factor if nominal growth is strong, but if nominal growth is negative it will not cut the other way. They will be penalised for having an uplift factor which does not represent the decline in their small business conditions or the sorts of investment circumstances that self&amp;hyphen;funded retirees would find themselves in. So I thought the member for Curtin raised an excellent point about the justification for subsection 9.

        Perhaps there is reason for the parliament to seek an amendment to the motion that the parliamentary secretary has moved, asking him to allow, under the standing orders, a clause&amp;hyphen;by&amp;hyphen;clause examination of these, so that the parliament can vote down subsection 9 if it so wishes. I am concerned—as, I am sure, self&amp;hyphen;funded retirees and small business owners throughout the nation are concerned—about this particular provision. It has been placed on
        <break page="3069" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        This is of critical interest to 800,000 provisional taxpayers around the country. Maybe there should be greater parliamentary scrutiny than just having this circulated in one moment and voted on in the next. I ask the parliamentary secretary to consider the virtues of a clause&amp;hyphen;by&amp;hyphen;clause examination, particularly with regard to subsection 9. I think common sense and fairness dictate that, if nominal GDP growth is high, the uplift factor should move up. If it is negative, it moves down. It may need to be negative, particularly in light of my earlier comments about the concern I have about this government's macro&amp;hyphen;economic management. If growth is going to collapse in the future, subsection 9 will be of grave concern to self&amp;hyphen;funded retirees and small businesses throughout the nation. I move:

        In moving that motion, the government agrees with the requested amendments moved in the other place. These amendments offer a compromise position to the government's proposed three per cent tariff concessional rate increase for all tariff concession goods.

        The principal request removes consumption goods from the three per cent tariff rate increase for tariff concession goods. The request will restore the free duty rate for those tariff concession goods. While it is conceded that the request does not implement the complete rate of increase proposed by the government, the government believes that it is an acceptable and workable compromise and the government is therefore prepared to vote to accept the requested amendments.

         —We agree to these amendments because they substantially give effect to the second reading amendment that we moved in this chamber that was defeated by the government. We are very pleased that the government has seen the merit of our arguments, not the least of which was that what it was proposing was effectively to introduce a consumption tax by the back door. We argued that this was contrary to any election promise and that whatever was considered dreadful policy for business should not end up as good policy for consumers.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government generally has tried to argue that what it was doing was not introducing a tax. It is very interesting that this comes back to us as a message from the Senate, and the reason it comes as a message from the Senate is because the Senate cannot amend a tax bill. They have obviously considered it a tax bill. I think the only person of integrity on the government's side has been the minister now at the table, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), who has at least had the decency to acknowledge, in closing the second reading debate last week, that this in fact was a tax. We cannot get that out of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) because he still
        <break page="3071" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         insists it is a tariff, but the reality is that it is a tax. The High Court says it is a tax, the Senate says it is a tax, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism says it is a tax. Everyone knows it is a tax, but the Treasurer tries to pretend that it is not.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The effect of this provision, had it not come back in this form, would have been to see a minimum 2,600 items attract this new consumer tax. We know that because, though it was like extracting teeth, we got at least a response in the Senate to the detailed list of items that would attract this consumer tax. I think the fact that there was a recognition that this would have far&amp;hyphen;reaching consequences is part of the reason why we have been successful in ensuring that consumers are protected from this tax measure. So we do claim credit for the fact that we have been able to protect those consumers and we appreciate the fact that the government has now seen fit to drop off or desist from its original intent, which was to extend this tax to consumers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I said at the outset that these amendments go a significant way towards what we moved in the House in the second reading. They do not completely go there; the other thing that we wanted them to do in terms of coming back with the redrafted bill was not just to protect consumers but to ensure that through the policy by&amp;hyphen;law mechanism there was still a capacity for industry to get, in effect, a zero rating. We always argued, when we were the government and when we announced our measures, that the safety net should still be in existence through the policy by&amp;hyphen;law. The government's original intent was to have the policy by&amp;hyphen;law also attract the three per cent rate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These amendments restore the zero rating for a number of areas, essentially capital equipment for use in agriculture, food processing and the food packaging industries. They do not, however, restore the zero rating for a number of manufactured items, in particular, categories 55, 57 and 60 under the particular legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We are still persisting with the view that they should be protected. Manufacturing industry in this country still needs the option of getting assistance—getting options for the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         zero rating—if they can prove their case. While we welcome these amendments, we still say that they do not go far enough and we will see what happens in the other place when the matter is returned. So far as these amendments are concerned, we welcome them, they represent what we put in the House and we thank the government for it.

Obviously, we would not want to expedite its proceeding beyond the reasonable level that any of us can expect is necessary for preparation of speakers to discuss it. That is basically what we are trying to argue here this evening. There has been some agreement and our members are ready. I presume that the minister, in introducing it, believes his are, and, of course, we will have no objection. But until the matter is resolved perhaps it is important for us to reserve our right to object to this particular course of action.

        I was ready to discuss the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill 1996 which is listed in the order of proceedings for the day and which has already been deferred and delayed by some time. We have a large number of speakers, some seven hours worth of them, waiting to discuss it, so it would be untoward if we were to see that as less important than the bill that is now before us. After the announcement today of the state of the environment report, unless there is some very good reason indeed why this bill should take precedence, we would certainly be arguing that it should be delayed until such time as the ordinary business of the House has been concluded.

       <para first-indent="16">
        As I stand here, effectively taking time, I am not certain of what status attaches to this bill. But I do know that this bill is one of great importance to us. We spent a great deal of time in government ensuring that we had a bill and a series of amendments over time that ensured the self&amp;hyphen;determination of the Aboriginal people. And it is not without moment that this legislation is objected to by a great many people, not only in the Aboriginal community but in the wider community who, as I understand it, see the contents of the bill as controversial and not likely to have
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         any necessary agreement—not just by ourselves, but by other parties.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For those reasons, it is important that we really do look at it closely. We are having discussions here and it is important that they be concluded. But as somebody who  formerly, as minister for aboriginal affairs, spent a lot of time and energy looking at these issues, I know how critical it is that this be given due consideration. If our shadow minister has not been given due notice, if the House has not been given due notice, we regard this as a usurpation of the forms of the House. Normally, all those ministers who have carriage of bills would be required to notify shadow ministers that they intend to deal with the matter as a matter of urgent business and that they intend to set aside the orders of the day that have been circulated amongst members—and they would give very good reasons indeed for seeking to do so.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That clearly has not happened. I have been in here for the last hour or so and I have not heard any argument to the effect that this is something that should take precedence over the existing orders of the day. It is a matter that will deserve a lot of attention and debate, and it will require a lot of the time of the House. But why it should be now, as opposed to later this evening, tomorrow or, indeed, when the parliament resumes after the break is very difficult for members on this side to determine.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The very important point needs to be made that there are procedures and that we do predicate our behaviour on the basis of those procedures. And if they are to be overturned, very good reasons indeed must be given. It is not reasonable in conducting the business of this House, or any other, to say to members on this side of the House—or your side, for that matter—that there will be an arbitrary determination made on the run about which bill should be dealt with and in what order. All of us have other matters to attend to and it is just fortunate the shadow minister, obviously watching the proceedings here intently, was able to come into this chamber very quickly.

The idea that we should have a guillotine on this where we set 10.30 p.m. as the time to finish, whether we have got the business that the opposition wishes to speak to through or not, seems to us to be rather draconian. I do not wish to be terribly critical of the government about this, because that probably would not be appropriate as we get to the end of the session—though if the failed former finance spokesman wants to encourage me to be critical of the government I am more than willing to do that.

        In the sense of reasonableness and wanting to see this very important issue debated in this place to the satisfaction of both sides, I think that the government should have been willing to give both more time and more notice to the shadow minister for Aboriginal Affairs. He has pursued this bill through the parliament and has a number of matters that he and other speakers on this side wish to address in relation to this bill.

        It is 7 o'clock on a Thursday evening, by which time the House would normally have gone home. Instead we are here talking about sitting on Friday, sitting until 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock or goodness knows what time tonight. We have already seen the government lose control of its program to the extent that not only have they brought in these new sitting hours where we were going to sit until 11 o'clock two nights a week, but we have sat until 11 o'clock every night of the week for the past few weeks. That has obviously taken its toll on the government because that is why they have not been able to get their act together now.

        From our point of view, this is not satisfactory. From the shadow minister's point of view, it is most unsatisfactory. From the point of view of the parliament as a whole, if this is the way we are going to be doing business on the run at the end of the sittings, it does not make for good  legislation or good consideration. It makes for bad law, particularly when we are dealing with a contentious matter such as this issue in relation to the Aboriginal affairs portfolio. We think that there should have been more cooperation and more time given for the debate. Seeing that the parliament will probably be sitting tomorrow, we are quite happy to debate this tomorrow.

         The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), who nearly fell into a black hole during the week and only salvaged himself by clasping the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to his bosom and reminding him of the deal that they made about the  bloodless changeover of the leadership a year or so ago, has skated out of the country tonight. He has left the coun try. Fortunately for him and unfortunately for Australia he has probably left to confuse people in other parts of the world. The last thing he wants is to be here tomorrow just in case the government should cave into respectability and have question time. He would certainly die on the hook tomorrow. The minister and all the rest of them have left the country. They are not willing to do the job that they are paid for. We are here at 7 o'clock on a Thursday night, wondering what we are up to.

        A bill was introduced in the Senate on 23 June 1996 and considered by the Senate on 25 and 26 June 1996. The bill was amended by the Senate. The key amendments by the Senate were to remove provisions which would enable the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to appoint an administrator to administer ATSIC's affairs in certain circumstances; reduce the size of ATSIC's regional councils; and, provide for the appointment of the commission chairman by the minister.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government cannot accept these amendments. As a consequence, the government has decided to introduce a new bill in the House of Representatives in identical terms to that introduced in the Senate on 23 June 1996.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill proposes certain amendments affecting the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, commonly referred to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         as ATSIC, and to the structure and operating arrangements for regional councils established under the ATSIC Act. The most significant amendments provide for a reduction in the size of regional councils; selection and appointment of the chairman of the commission by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs; improved accountability arrangements for regional councils; and, an appointment of an administrator to manage the operations of ATSIC if the administration of public money by ATSIC has been fraudulent or has involved gross mismanagement, or if ATSIC has intentionally failed to comply with a general direction.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When ATSIC came into being, a little over six years ago, it was recognised as representing a unique experiment in public administration. Nothing like it had been tried before in Australia or overseas. A review by ATSIC of the operation of the ATSIC Act was completed in early 1993, and a number of significant recommendations for change were made as a result of that review. Amongst those recommendations were recommendations for a reduction in the number of regional councils and for the commission chairman to be elected by the zone commissioners, rather than being chosen by the minister. The recommendation to reduce the number of regional councils was aimed at increasing management efficiency and enabling better servicing and resourcing of regional councils.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The recommendation to provide for an elected commission chairman was based on the notion that this would be consistent with the principles of empowerment, self&amp;hyphen;determination and self-management, which were the basis for ATSIC's establishment. Nevertheless, the commission's report containing this recommendation did acknowledge that the question of appointment of the commission chairman was a complex issue.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The report expressed that, in many ways, the chairman is the primary link and source of day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day advice between the commission and the government. It went on to say that the chairman must be a person in whom the government may have total confidence, at the same time as having the confidence and trust
        <break page="3077" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         of, and the ability to represent, all of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The former government accepted both the recommendations for amendment to the ATSIC Act at that time. Consequently, a 1993 amendment to the ATSIC Act provided for a reduction in the number of regional councils from 60 to 36. The reduction in the number of regional councils took effect for the round of regional council elections conducted on 4 December 1993.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The 1993 amendment to the ATSIC Act also included amendments which provided for a fully elected board of 17 ATSIC commissioners, with the members of that board to elect one of their number to be commission chairman. However, these amendments were expressed to be effective from 1 July 1996 and were therefore intended to affect arrangements for the next board of commissioners following the next round of regional council elections due to be held later this year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Following completion of the 1993 round of ATSIC regional council elections and the subsequent zone elections, an independent panel was convened under section 141 of the ATSIC Act to review ATSIC's boundaries and electoral systems. The review panel conducted consultation meetings in 20 locations throughout the country. Its report to the former minister on its review of electoral systems was completed in March 1995 and was tabled in the House of Representatives on 11 May 1995 and in the Senate on 30 May 1995. One of the recommendations of the review panel was that the size of regional councils be reduced.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Currently, the number of members on a regional council is dependent on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population of the region, and ranges from a low of 10 for regions with an estimated population of fewer than 1,000 people, to a high of 20 for regions with an estimated population of 10,000 or more. The review panel proposed that the act be amended to provide for regional councils to comprise eight members for regions of fewer than 1,000 people, increasing to a maximum of 12 members for regions with a population exceeding 10,000 people.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The initiative was seen as one which would facilitate more effective and efficient operations by regional councils. In essence, it was the view of the review panel that the larger a regional council is, beyond an optimum size, the more unwieldy it is and the less effective it is in the performance of its function.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The review panel's report included advice of concerns that: under current arrangements, decision making processes are unnecessarily protracted due to the size of the regional councils; in some cases, councillors, who are often elected with minimal community support, have little interest or make little contribution to regional council operations; and administrative expenditure associated with the operation of regional councils, including travelling allowances and fees for members, should be kept to the minimum level necessary so that the money available to address community needs can be maximised. The government accepts the recommendation of the review panel to reduce the size of regional councils and the basis for this recommendation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The proposed amendment will contribute to greater efficiency in regional council operations and reduced administrative costs associated with the operation of regional councils. It will also help to ensure that the membership on regional councils is gained on the basis of a more appropriate level of community support.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Regarding selection of a commission chairman, the government acknowledges the importance of democratic principles in assisting the achievement of greater self&amp;hyphen;management and independent decision making. However, the government maintains that it must retain an appropriate degree of control and accountability where large amounts of government funds are being administered. This is basically because we operate in a system of Westminster government and there is nothing like ATSIC anywhere else in the Westminster system. In the end, it is the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs who is accountable before the parliament. Selection of a commission chairman by government is central to the achievement of this objective.
        </para>
        <break page="3078" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Currently, the board of commissioners comprises 17 elected commissioners and two commissioners chosen by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. The minister is required to appoint one of the 19 commissioners to be commission chairman. The amendment proposed in this bill would have the effect of retaining the current arrangements so that, following the next round of zone elections, the 17 elected commissioners would not elect one of their number to be commission chairman. Rather, a further two commissioners would be appointed by the minister, who would then appoint one of the 19 commissioners to be commission chairman.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Another significant area addressed by the bill is the improvement of accountability arrangements for regional councils. In the interest of greater public accountability, the bill includes amendments to make regional council meetings open to the public and to give the public an entitlement to inspect a range of regional council documents.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Under the proposed amendments, regional council meetings will generally be open to the public but will be able to be closed in certain circumstances, similar to those in which local government meetings can be closed. Such circumstances include where commercial&amp;hyphen;in&amp;hyphen;confidence and personal privacy issues are being discussed, and where it is necessary to deal with disruptive conduct.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Additionally, the public will have an entitlement to inspect regional council codes of conduct, written procedures for meetings, management plans, written policy documents relating to the payment of expenses and provision of facilities to regional councillors, minutes of meetings—except where the meetings or the minutes are closed in relation to the exceptions I have mentioned—and other documents which would otherwise be accessible under freedom of information legislation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          This bill also allows for the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to appoint an administrator to ATSIC or to the Torres Strait Regional Authority in the event that the minister is satisfied that the administration of public money by ATSIC or
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           by the Torres Strait Regional Authority involves fraud or gross mismanagement by the board of ATSIC or the Torres Strait Regional Authority. The minister would also be able to appoint an administrator should ATSIC or the Torres Strait Regional Authority breach a direction given to it by the minister. In this regard, the minister recently issued directions to both ATSIC and the Torres Strait Regional Authority requiring that proposed grants and loans be subject to the scrutiny of a special auditor.
          </break>
         </para>

          This power will enable the government to oversee the administration of public money by ATSIC or the Torres Strait Regional Authority and to act quickly to stop any misuse of taxpayers' money. Of course, I would expect that the appointment of an administrator would be resorted to only in extreme circumstances. I hope an administrator will never be necessary.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Once appointed, the administrator would assume control of the organisation's property and affairs and perform the powers and functions normally undertaken by ATSIC or the Torres Strait Regional Authority as the case may be. The organisation would continue to operate with the administrator making decisions which would otherwise be made by the ATSIC Board of Commissioners or the Torres Strait Regional Authority members. In this way, the provision of services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would proceed with minimal disruption while whatever problems identified are examined.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The administrator will be able to conduct reviews and recommend changes to the structure and operations of ATSIC or the Torres Strait Regional Authority. This would ensure that the difficulties which led to appointment of the administrator can be remedied during the administrator's appointment and will not be repeated in the future. In this way, the elected representatives would be in the best possible position to resume control when the appointment of the administrator ends.

           In the end, this is necessary given, as I said before, that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is the person under the Westminster system who is respon sible to the parliament for the expenditure of public funds, even by a body such as ATSIC. I present the explanatory memorandum for the information of honourable members. I commend the bill to the House.

It has, from its inception, treated indigenous people with contempt and played politics with indigenous people's lives—low&amp;hyphen;grade politics. From the outset, we have had a government that has gone after indigenous groups; the most vulnerable groups in the community.

         program with a number of allegations. We had the Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), in their outraged state, conducting a press conference on 10 April 1996 and announcing measures that the cabinet were introducing, based on allegations from a

Yesterday, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs tabled in the Senate the five audited reports. And what do they do? A proper reading of those reports clears ATSIC. Thank God there was no death penalty, because they were hung, drawn and quartered by the coalition!

         The excuse of endemic corruption and accountability of public funds was used by this government to introduce these draconian measures which were to take away from ATSIC and indigenous people the right, for the first time, to elect the chair of ATSIC. They have never had that right before. In October and November 1993, the parliament debated that issue, and legislation was passed allowing for an elected chair at the next round
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          of elections. So they could not use the fact that there was an elected chair as an excuse for these measures as a result of endemic corruption or whatever. They used it as an excuse to appoint an administrator. This is a beat&amp;hyphen;up of monumental proportions.

         The story needs to be told that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs went to cabinet with a proposal in relation to the elected chair and the regional councillors. He was comprehensively mauled by the cabinet. The concept of a special auditor and the concept of an administrator was introduced by cabinet. They wanted to sack ATSIC there and then and were told they could not. What has happened since? No consultation. There was a committee hearing by Senate members last Friday, and it was embarrassing. The performance by the minister in relation to the efforts of consultation was embarrassing. The chair of ATSIC gets advised of a cabinet decision in relation to the administrator half an hour before the press conference.

         Yet we are told by this government that this is a government for all of us. They campaigned on the slogan `For all of us', and what has happened since they have been elected? `For all of us' has been modified. It does not include indigenous people—they were the first targets. It does not include migrants—they were the second targets. It does not include the unemployed—they were the third targets, followed by public servants and unionists. Why? This is an opinion poll&amp;hyphen;driven government. It has been driven by opinion polls since the current Prime Minister became the Leader of the Opposition. Remember the facts: in about February last year, before the budget, republic advertising went astray and ended up on my fax machine. This is all about opinion polls. Low&amp;hyphen;grade politics.

         This is what the proposal will do. You do not want an independent chairperson who is there fighting on behalf of indigenous people. You want to appoint your lackey. Janet Holmes a Court, a reputable businesswoman, was appointed prior to the calling of an election and tapped on the shoulder after the election. It is just not on. What kind of message does that send to the rest of the community?

         Is it any wonder that former senator Chris Puplick, head of the anti&amp;hyphen;discrimination board, went on radio in New South Wales shortly after these proposals were announced and pointed out in no uncertain terms that there has been an increase in racist behaviour, that indigenous people are being singled out and that racist taunts and attacks are on the increase? Why? Because we have a government that does not understand, that is absolutely insensitive when it comes to indigenous people. The way the government members have conducted themselves in relation to this bill shows it.

         We should have a look at the actions. We exempted this bill from the cut&amp;hyphen;off in the Senate. We were told, `This is an urgent bill because there are elections in October 1996 for ATSIC. Can we consider it in the current session of parliament?' We said, `Fine, we will look at the merit of the bill.' So this bill was not subjected to the normal cut-off. There are many aspects of this bill that passed through the Senate with opposition and minor party support. A number of things in this bill will improve the round of elections with regard to ATSIC and that will help improve accountability. We are not saying that the current bill and the current structure are perfect and do not require modification or amendment or cannot be improved, but let us have some consultation.

In a number of instances, it is ATSIC that has been criticised for trying to protect public moneys. ATSIC has been criticised in relation to the New South Wales legal services because they are only releasing moneys on a quarterly basis, not on an annual basis.

I do not blame the poor Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, who was censured in the Senate today; I blame the cabinet. This is a classic example of why you should not have policy on the run. The poor old minister who was given this portfolio unexpectedly—he did not expect to be a minister—has a reputation for decency. What has the cabinet done to him? They have put lead in his saddlebags. They have now given him a poisoned chalice.

When were they tabled? They were tabled on the day the bill went down in the Senate. There are matters in relation to these audit reports that will require the ATSIC Act to be amended. I say to the government, despite their ineptitude in the way they have handled this to date: the opposition will support measures in relation to accountability but it will not support measures that are aimed at taking away self-determination when there is no basis, no foundation for what the government is doing.

That is $750,000 less that will be spent on Aboriginal communities. It is the most audited department in the Commonwealth. There was a situation where National Rail overspent its

We are a decent society. I am not saying we do everything right.

         We will circulate some amendments that we believe will improve aspects of the bill. In relation to those people qualified to stand for regional councils and for the commission, I suggest the government consider the way in which the act is structured because at the moment it relates to penalty only. It talks about imprisonment of 12 months or more or, regarding embezzlement matters, imprisonment of three months or more.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The amendment we successfully moved in the Senate is similar to what is contained in the constitution. That is, it is based on the penalty for which the person has been convicted. So, if it is an offence that carries 12 months imprisonment or more, you are disqualified from holding office or from standing for office for the period of the sentence or for the period of the recognisance. I think the community would be concerned if someone were convicted of embezzlement and still occupied their position if they did not receive a sentence. Sadly, that is the situation at the moment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Our measure is to improve the qualifications of people's eligibility to stand. If you are convicted of an offence that carries 12 months or more, I happen to believe that, similar to members of parliament, you should be disqualified from holding office or standing for parliament. There is some misconception. I notice that the minister implied in the debate in the Senate that he thought we were breaking down that qualification—we
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          are not. If you were to be sentenced to three months imprisonment for embezzlement, I think there is every chance of that type of offence carrying a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more. It was for that reason we deleted those amendments in the Senate in relation to the three months imprisonment.

         I am happy to talk to government advisers in this regard because we are about doing this properly—we are not about doing it on the run. That is the last thing that decent people in the indigenous community, and indeed in the general community, want. That is my main criticism of this. As an opposition we have said all along that, if there is a case to be made out, let us sit down and take the politics out of this portfolio. You are not in opposition now. You won. You have a three-year term. You will be judged on your record. But, quite frankly, your record at the moment is one of insensitivity, and there is also despair.

        <para first-indent="16">
         We have had a situation where the minister, again, as I understand it, has had to say to the Senate that he has to amend the special auditor provisions because there are these unintended consequences resulting from the general direction of CDEP funding. That is why the minister ended up being censured in the Senate today. It is not because he has intentionally done these things. This is a complicated area; it is not as simple as it looks.

         We are not here just to take an oppositionist point of view. There are people who have longstanding experience here and I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it is in the interests of all of us—unless you are playing politics—to take this off the front page, to get it right. It is about service delivery. But the community would be concerned to find out that $750,000 for six months only is being spent on a special auditor, when these audit reports show that the Office of Evaluation and Audit has the necessary statutory authority under the ATSIC Act at the moment—and as for resources, that office could do with the resources. If amendments are required to chase the money trail, let us make them.

         In relation to the reduction of regional councils, I had a chart prepared for our caucus. I understand where that recommendation comes from—there was a review. There is a review after each round of ATSIC elections to see whether the system is working and to put forward recommendations on how it can be improved. You also need to understand that just because the ATSIC commissioners do a review does not necessarily mean that indigenous people on the ground or in regional councils support that view or have been consulted about it.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In 1990, when the first round of ATSIC elections occurred, there were 60 regional councils and 809 regional councillors. Then there was a review which said, `Too big, unworkable.' They cut the number of regional councils from 60 to 36, with the number of representatives going from 809 to 593. That is a big cut—a cut of 216, to be exact.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What has happened with this recommendation is that they have used a mathematical formula again, and I do not think people appreciate the unintended consequences of that. It has meant slashing and burning across all regional councils—urban regional councils and country regional councils. If the government's proposals are accepted, a further 196 regional councillors will go. That is a huge cut to make as the number will then go down to 397. So in 1990 they had 809. If these proposals are carried, they will end up with 397—a reduction of more than half.

         What we are concerned about is that in remote areas, large areas, some distinct communities will miss out. I have been having consultations in relation to this proposal.

         In this area our position was, `Look, let's have a look at the proposal on its merits.' And the reason we are opposing the reduction with the amendments we will move later this evening is that we think that because it is not a reduction in the number of regional councils and it is just mathematically based that the government needs to have a look, have a review. This was one of the amendments that were successfully moved in the Senate: to look at these remote communities. So we will back you on a reduction, but let us do it more sensitively.

Thirteen years of Labor have done nothing for the Aboriginal communities throughout the Northern Territory. It has been 13 years of neglect and some communities have gone backwards over that time. He has the passion here tonight to knock the bill that we said we wanted some urgency on.

Today in 1996 when you go through the communities, health services are lacking, and they blame the state and territory governments for not providing the services. But look at the budget of over $1 billion a year that ATSIC gets. Back in 1991&amp;hyphen;92 and the earlier days of the Depart ment of Aboriginal Affairs it was about $400 million.

Sometimes a skin group may have authority to handle money and a person within that group might be under some pressure from their own family to hand on some of those funds. Whilst that person is not embezzling the money on their own behalf, they are certainly misusing public funds. If the act is amended to three months and that person went before a magistrate, they might get the three&amp;hyphen;month penalty because they were under pressure to embezzle.

Within the first 24 hours, I was rung by two former ministers for Aboriginal affairs who were from the other side of politics, who not merely congratulated me upon my appointment but offered me the benefit of their knowledge and their experience. On at least several occasions I had occasion to call on that, and on several occasions they came to see me to draw my attention to matters which were within their knowledge and not mine.

        The reality is that, while the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) may speak on this legislation and give us the benefit of his knowledge, the problems in the Northern Territory are not the problems of Aboriginal communities in Fitzroy and Melbourne.

        This is what makes this portfolio so difficult to administrate. This is why, in my view, the government, with the best intentions in the world, should not be rushing this sort of legislation through the parliament. They should be giving the minister the time and opportunity to get across this portfolio and to meet more Aboriginal people and Aboriginal leaders in order to win their confidence; because there is no minister who has come into this portfolio who does not have a very difficult task.

        I spent the first two years in my portfolio, because money was being taken, making a very simple proposition in  every community I went to. It was to say very simply this: when money comes into the portfolio of Aboriginal affairs, it is not the government's money; it is your money. If for any reason you steal it, you are going to go to gaol. It is as simple as that. On several occasions that occurred.

        As a result of land rights and as a result of government programs, it is perfectly true that in some communities you have rich Aboriginals and you have poor ones. You have Aboriginal people who have hung onto the strength of their culture and their beliefs. You only have to go to certain parts of Australia and put your backside down in the dirt and it will take 20 minutes before a conversation starts. The first two people who will speak will not be the principal person, and then you will hear from the old man who is the acknowledged leader of that community. That is how it operates.

        It would be of great value to the minister to go and sit down under a tree with perhaps Bill Neidjie—a man learned in the law, one of the older men who has written and committed his law to paper because he was so concerned to preserve Aboriginal culture. He was the first Aboriginal person to actually sit down and write his story to try to reproduce his culture so that his grandchildren would have something to hang onto.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There are many great people in Aboriginal society, but they are like the rest of us. There is good and bad in every community. In my profession, I am sad to see it when colleagues rort their trust funds and go to gaol. But there has been no government in any state parliament saying, `Look, solicitors are stealing trust funds. Perhaps what we had better do is have the Attorney-General appoint the president of the law council or the law institute.' This view in many ways, unfortunately, has permeated the culture of this parliament when it comes to dealing with Aboriginal affairs. Unfortunately, I think it was perpetrated in a book recently published and launched by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, and I hope he did that on the basis that he had not read it but thought he was doing the right thing.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the things I have learned—and it was a hard learning course—is the whole concept of assimilation. Governments decided that the best thing you could do for Aboriginal people was that, if they were going to die
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         out, you could take their children, move them from their natural parents and put them in hospitals far away from home. They were not evil. They were not bad. They had a perception that everything would be all right if Aboriginal people would only be like us.

        That is one of the reasons that so often in this parliament the conversation turns on money, housing and health. That is not to say that those things are not important. They are important. But I suspect that what is behind that is the view that if we fix up the health and housing side of things and there is a school they can go to, they will be like us—and that is a fallacy.

        I wish that this minister could be given time to breathe, to move into the broader aspects of Aboriginal society. Perhaps he could visit the Northern Territory, where we have the finest rock art collection in the world. In France 200,000 tourists a year look at a rock art collection that does not compete. I wish the minister had time to walk through the bush with eight&amp;hyphen; and 10&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old kids; they see things that we do not see. We can meet Aboriginal people who have made for themselves a significant lifestyle, but who have not abandoned their culture.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It is important that we in this parliament realise that we are dealing with people who have the oldest existing culture in the world. Many Aboriginal people have moved into high positions in our society and have become very successful in the things that they have done. They have also gone through traditional ceremonies. Some of them have done that at a fairly late stage in life. At the end of that experience, they say that it was the most significant thing that has happened to them in their lifetime. Despite all the things that have happened to Aboriginal people, that is a legacy which, in a spirit of generosity, they are happy to share with us. The day that this community is strong enough, brave enough and morally courageous enough to lift up our hands and pick that up is the day that we will be well on the way towards not only solving their problems but also a lot of ours.

        Look at the various structures in our society that have made mistakes. There is no argument that ATSIC is less than perfect. But I do not know that it is any less perfect in its processes than this parliament or the state parliaments. But to move to a stage of saying, `This government is going to make the minister choose the chairman, whether he wants to or not' is to put Aboriginal groups around Australia in a position of saying, `They don't trust us. We're back to the old model. We're back to a situation where it is white fellas telling us which black fella is going to be our boss.' What will happen? There is bound to be some Aboriginal—a reasonable salary is attached to the position—who will face the problems. But that is wrapping around the neck of the minister concepts that he is going to have to live with in relation to every Aboriginal community in Australia. I do not believe that is fair to him. I do not even think it is fair to this government, to be candid. There are no quick fixes in this area.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Therefore, I believe that the government should pause—there is no great urgency to pass this legislation in the dying hours of this session of parliament—to give this minister time. It does not matter whether or not you dismiss what occurred in the Senate today as a political exercise. The real issue is what Aboriginal communities the length and breadth of Australia are going to think about that. Aboriginal communities are as politically divided as the rest of society. They are going to say, `We are dealing with a minister who wants to tell us what his solutions are instead of sitting down and listening to us and talking to us, addressing these problems together.'

        Would it have made any real difference if Lois O'Donoghue had been left in her position for another 12 months?

With the best intentions in the world, what the government has done here is

        There is a major learning curve that he has a right to be across. What you are doing is placing a burden on him which will haunt him for the rest of his period as a minister. If there is any sensitivity and if there is any commonsense, I would say to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and I would say to his cabinet colleagues: don't be in any hurry to pass this legislation. Give the minister time to establish the relationships he needs to have. Give the minister time to reach out and establish relationships not just with Aboriginal people but also with island people. They are also his responsibility.

        I choose to finish where I started. There is a real difference within states.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There was a time, when I first came into this parliament, when members from various parts of Australia had a knowledge of and a relationship with Aboriginal people, but unfortunately such has been the nature and the development of our parliament that that is no longer the case. There are no quick fix solutions. There is no one single piece of legislation that is going to change the way Aboriginal people relate to the government, relate to each other and relate to a dominant white society. Some are emerging through that society who still want to retain their Aboriginal culture and tradition.

        The Aboriginal people, whatever their shortcomings, whatever their problems, are worthy of a more sophisticated approach to their problems and to this issue than the one that is currently being displayed in this parliament. This approach of the government, in my view, will not do anything but put it in a situation that it does not have to be in. It will put the minister in a situation, if he has any background at all, if anyone can talk to him about it, which no minister should be in in the early days of his ministry.

        To that extent, I hope I have pointed out, in a bipartisan way, that this is not the way to go, this is not the way to proceed. It is about building new relationships. The government is entitled to produce new concepts and try to make them work. This minister will make his mistakes, as every minister has made his mistakes, but at the end of the day I believe that on all sides of the House there are members who have a genuine concern to deal with the problems of our Aboriginal people, our indigenous people. They have much to benefit from a positive response and we as a community have a great deal to gain from reaching out and understanding that culture, its relationship to this great land of ours and, more importantly, its relationship to our children and the future of this country.

I would have to say to the honourable gentleman that his side of the House is in no position to make comments about tactics in this place.

        I would suggest to the member for Banks that if many of those failures had been identified—and I am not singling out ATSIC; I am talking about any government bureaucracy—and were actually dealt with at that stage, we probably would not have found it necessary to be introducing this legislation today. It is the failure over a number of years to deal with known problems that has precipitated this sort of legislation.

The reality is that he was a member of the government. He was on the government's side. He had input into that government. Now he is the shadow minister.

It is time that we looked at some of those problems. It seems to me that we have had a situation where there have been large numbers of regional councils which have very small constituencies.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Yes, of course there is a need to make sure that different groups and remote communities are properly represented. You cannot always expect that you are going to have the sort of hierarchical representation in the Aboriginal culture that is often so much the case in the broader community. But the reality is that those regional councils often have been poorly staffed. The representatives have not been used to dealing with that format.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We found quite frequently that people had used their positions to their advantage in all sorts of ways. Unfortunately, the regional councils clearly have not been the sort of driving force at the grassroots level that they should have been. Therefore, it is appropriate that we look at restructuring them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Initially, there were 800 members of regional councils for populations of 260,000 to 270,000 people. That is totally disproportionate. It is too many. In this House we have 148 members to represent some 18 million people. The proportion that were present in regional councils, therefore, was totally inappropriate. It is appropriate that we reduce the numbers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let us also have a look at some of the other issues that are so important and which this government wants to try to address. The previous speaker, the gentleman from Melbourne Ports, with whom I have a degree of common ground, as I said before, said, `Don't blame the previous government. It wasn't their fault.' To a certain extent he was right from the point of view that you will not fix the problems in five minutes: it will take time. I think it is fair to say that we should have seen some improvement in conditions,

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let us look at the subject of housing. Only a couple of years ago a major housing report indicated that to bring Aboriginal housing standards in this country up to par with the rest of the community it would cost some $2 billion. I can remember going to remote communities right across the top end of this country, where you had anywhere from 20 to 25, or even 30-odd, people in a little three-bedroom house. The facts of life are that the previous government failed almost totally to deal with the problems of overcrowding and substandard and inappropriate housing in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. It is a record that in 13 years they should have been able to make some impact on.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let us look at the subject of health. The health of the indigenous population has been a perennial brickbat under the previous government. It was only last year that the previous government decided to transfer responsibility for health back to the former Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence)—the lady from Fremantle. She set up a great bureaucratic structure which, after three months, had not even been staffed, let alone done anything about health. The reality of life is that Aboriginal health standards have not improved in the last 13 years. If anything, they are getting worse.

        You know, Mr Deputy Speaker, because you and I have been away with a standing committee of this place on a number of occasions, that if you are born today, in 1996, as an Aboriginal male you have an 18-year less life expectancy than if you are born a non-Aboriginal person. Those sorts of statistics are unacceptable and the shadow minister at the table should understand that his government had 13 years not to fix the problem but to start to improve the problem. The reality is: you did not start to improve those figures.

        Let us look at the subject of education in indigenous communities. I challenge any Labor member in this chamber to produce a skerrick of evidence that the standards of Aboriginal education improved in the 13 years they were in government. Let's not talk about retention rates; let's talk about the basics. You can go into any remote Aboriginal community and the local primary school and you will find, because of health, that often 50 per cent of the class have got middle ear infections and they cannot hear. They have a health problem and that means they have an education problem.

        I see the honourable gentleman for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) is sitting in the chamber. I assume he is going to speak next. He knows what I am referring to because he has been with us and has seen some of these things. I do not think any of us are proud about that. We all should be ashamed of it. My point is that although you will not have fixed it in 13 years—the gentleman from Melbourne Ports is right—you should have made some improvements. I give you credit for having the concern for wanting to do something about it, but the reality is you were not successful. It was not for want of trying on the part of the honourable member for Charlton and his government; they were well motivated. They used plenty of money, and all the rest of it.

        Therefore, we are trying to do things in a slightly different way. We may even have some differences of view on this side about some of the things we might want to do, but the former government does not have the right to actually criticise what we are doing at this stage—three months down the track—because we were elected and we are going to try and do things differently to improve some of those standards.

        Let us look at jobs. As you go round the country, the figure of 80 per cent unemployment is the norm in indigenous Aboriginal communities.

        I have not talked about some of the more scandalous things concerning custody levels. The reality is that after all the royal commissions, after spending millions of dollars and having every federal government department and state government making annual reports about how they are going to implement the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody—I agreed with the findings of the royal commission, there is no question about that: both sides of the House did—those deaths in custody are not only continuing but also getting worse.

You are going to have time on your hands and you are going to do what anybody in those socioeconomic circumstances is going to do: you are going to get into crime and substance abuse.

        We will have some internal debates—that is the best way. I agree with many of the comments that the gentleman from Melbourne Ports made about having to acknowledge the cultural differences. We cannot come into this place and just say, `We're going to do it the way we would do it in my suburban seat in Melbourne.' The reality is that will not work. You can fly into my seat in Melbourne and you can call a particular group—the youth workers, the unemployed counsellors or whoever it is—and sit them down. You can have an agenda and you can go zonk, zonk, zonk down the agenda. You can talk about things and people will be up&amp;hyphen;front and argue their case. You can say, `Well, maybe I've got an understanding of the problem. I've got something to deal with.'

        The gentleman from Melbourne Ports was right. You go in there and the first people who talk to you will not necessarily be the ones who really know what it is all about or have the authority. You can have a big formal meeting—and you will get everybody from the community there—and talk about the issues. One or two will talk but, quite clearly, there are people who know better, because you can see the look of horror on their face sometimes when some of the more ridiculous comments are made. But the ones who know will not speak and you know damn well that you are not getting the right input. But, when you adjourn the formal meeting and go outside to sit under the tree or on the verandah and have a cup of tea or stay there for a meal or go back for your third or fourth visit over three or four months and people get to know you, then you start to find out what people really think.

         The indigenous way is not to have an up&amp;hyphen;front conversation. The indigenous way is to have consensus. The indigenous way is to say, `I don't send a representative down south to go and negotiate on my behalf. I send people down to find out what the other lot—the government, or whoever it is—want to say, and they come and talk to us. We have got to have time to talk about it.' It is a different way of doing things. I am not saying it is a better way, I am not saying it is a worse way; I am saying it is a different way. We, as a broader Australian community, have to understand that there are those cultural differences. If we are to fix the problems of health, housing, education, jobs, custody levels, welfare dependency and all those things, we have to acknowledge there are different ways of dealing with that community.

         I have to say to those on the other side of the House that, whilst on many occasions in this place I have taken a bipartisan view and whilst on many occasions I have publicly acknowledged the good intentions of many members on the other side when they were in government and publicly supported many of the programs, at the end of the day there is no evidence that the situation is improving. Therefore, we have to search for new ways of doing things. Whether I like every bit of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1996 or anybody else does, the reality is we are starting to turn over a new leaf. I urge the House to support the bill.

People have been critical of the fact that ATSIC has an annual budget of something like $1 billion. Federally, we have an annual budget of something approaching $150 billion. If we were to extract from that the amount of money which is applied by us to administer the processes of government and to administer government departments and the bureaucracy before we started to deliver actual dollars in services to those people to whom so much of those funds were to be applied, I think people might well come to the conclusion that we have not performed very well.

         It is suggested, for example, that the chairperson of ATSIC not be elected by those people whom the chairperson is intended to represent—as the Prime Minister of Australia is elected in a sense by the broader community—but be appointed by the minister. The minister will have the individual capacity, without even reference to the commission itself, to appoint an administrator to take over the responsibilities of ATSIC. If that is not tainted with paternalism, I do not know what types of measures that have been introduced in this parliament in the past are.

         To a very large extent, it reflects two things.

Secondly, it reflects the inadequacy of those people on the other side—and I will exclude from this the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), because he is one of those genuine people on the government benches and you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, are another, if I might be permitted to say so.

         Generally, as I say, there has been an inadequacy on the part of those people who have been appointed by the Liberal Party in particular to represent Aboriginal interests at the government level. For example, one of the major things that brought the present Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) undone when he was a former leader of the Liberal Party was a trip to the Northern Territory where he confused the emotional stress and trauma he said he experienced after seeing the

          Aboriginal women's corroboree and as a result of that made some blunders. The only thing is that the blunders were made before the corroboree.

         The previous spokesperson for the coalition parties, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), admitted that she learnt about Aboriginal questions from watching television of an evening. When we suggested that it might be advisable for her to get out into Aboriginal communities and talk to Aboriginal people, it came as a bit of a surprise to her. She did make some attempt after that to do so. But she had not initially. I sat in this chamber one evening with national leaders of the Aboriginal community sitting up in that gallery while this parliament considered some of these questions, and that spokesperson to whom I referred, the member for Hindmarsh, shouted abuse at those national Aboriginal leaders sitting up in the gallery.

I have no doubt that he is a very competent surgeon. I have no doubt that he is a nice chap. But, in understanding Aboriginal issues and in administering an Aboriginal department, he is a disaster. Apparently, a motion of censure was passed in the Senate this evening against Senator Herron. He has no understanding of some of the sensitivities and complexities of the portfolio with which he

After he was appointed as Aboriginal affairs minister, Senator Herron said:

         Of course, we could say that about the white community as well—we could also say it about the Asian community—but the very fact that it is expressed exclusively for the Aboriginal community reflects that paternalistic attitude people have towards Aboriginal people. In referring to the $1 billion in the ATSIC budget, he went on to say:

           —You are a good Deputy Speaker, Mr Deputy Speaker. One of the other things the good senator did in his capacity as Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs was to ask the police to investigate the behaviour of a certain person. In connection with these alleged criminal charges or claims—apart from the giving of their name, of course—this person was identified as being `closely linked to a commissioner of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission'. This person was closely linked to a commissioner from ATSIC.

          So what? All people who are charged with any types of offences are closely linked to someone. But why in this particular case should the person charged with the administration of the department of Aboriginal affairs choose to draw attention to the fact that criminal allegations had been made against someone—not someone who is a commissioner of ATSIC—who is closely related to or associated with a commissioner from ATSIC? That is very disturbing. As I say, it reflects, perhaps more than most other things, the way in which there is this presumption of corruption, dishonesty and inadequacy on the part of so many people in their attitude towards Aboriginal people and Aboriginal problems.

          I have found the reference to which I referred just a while ago. Two people in six years have been charged with misappropriation of ATSIC funds. I wish our record were as good among people who are occupying positions of responsibility and public trust—not so much in the parliament but in all those other organisations right through the national community where funds are being used and applied in different ways. For all of the people who have been involved in ATSIC over six years, only two people have been

          I would also emphasise that there have been quite a number of people—some of them with very close associations, formal associations, with the Liberal Party and the National Party—who have been aghast at some of the claims that have been made in connection with this whole question of ATSIC, these amendments and some of the arguments which have been used to justify them, to explain them and to excuse them. I refer to people like Ian Viner, a former Liberal minister. I refer to Fred Chaney, a former federal minister. I refer to Chris Puplick, a man of great distinction and integrity. I also refer to people from the Aboriginal community like Pat O'Shane and Lois O'Donoghue, who is the Chairman of ATSIC.

         <para first-indent="16">
          All of those people are people of substance and, I believe, people of honesty, integrity, judgment and clear perception. They have expressed concerns in one way or another. We have people like Mick Dodson, for example, who said—in reference to that comment by Senator Herron about someone having criminal accusations made against them when they were associated with someone from ATSIC—that Senator Herron had acted as judge and executioner in saying that he believed the criminal allegations against a person close to an ATSIC commission board member were true.

          We just do not do that kind of thing.

That is just appalling. I do not believe that anyone, any reasonable person in this chamber or in the wider community, could possibly endorse that type of approach. Yet that is the approach which has been taken by the federal minister.

        The only basic test that can be applied is whether the socioeconomic standing of Aboriginal communities since ATSIC was formed six years ago vis-a-vis the rest of Australia has improved, whether it has remained static or whether it has gone backwards.

        I was part of the New South Wales Greiner government, which came into government in 1988. I was asked by the then Premier to administer the Office of Aboriginal Affairs and to look at the whole issue of land rights

I had no interest in Aboriginal affairs, but the Premier thought that we should look at it from the point of view of management. As I owned a company prior to entering parliament and as I knew how to run a business, he thought I should look at it from a different point of view—from a business management point of view.

        I recall going out into the communities throughout New South Wales and visiting them, trying to understand how they live and trying to understand why there was that bitterness and hatred towards anyone who came from the government or anyone who was white or anyone who tried to tell them how to run their affairs. What I found most interesting of all is that after I had had the meetings, when all of the angst would come out from them towards me, they would pull me aside and say, `I didn't mean the things I said. We know you want to help us, but why is it that we are not getting the money through? Where is the money going?' That was an interesting thing that I found was being directed at me repeatedly. They were saying, `We understand there is money in the kitty. People tell us there is X amount of money coming to us.' In the case of New South Wales, it was 7&amp;half; per cent of the moneys collected through land tax.

They are saying something to us that obviously is not getting through to those opposite or that they choose to ignore for what I would not like to feel are political purposes.

I spoke to the Irish owner of the company who had agreed to stay with the company for 12 months to train the apprentices. I recall him saying to me, `We have four young Aborigines and they are the best young apprentices I have had in my 40 years in this trade.' They were given an opportuni ty; they grasped the opportunity, and they made a success of it. Additionally, with a committee that I was chairing at the time I visited Kakadu and Uluru.

If there are amendments or changes that those opposite feel need to be considered, then they have to demonstrate that to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and to those of us on this side of the House. I am certain that the minister will take that into consideration when a future occasion arises for amendments that will no doubt occur in ATSIC.

In speaking to the ATSIC Amendment Bill, one has to consider the history of ATSIC. ATSIC was the creation of Gerry Hand, the then Aboriginal affairs minister.

It is the same for any group in Australia—Lebanese or anyone else. The extended family makes economic sense.

But no. The thinking of the bureaucracy was for out-stations, so they got out-stations.

There are many reasons for having out&amp;hyphen;stations. One reason is that it is simply an escape from those who have the power. This was certainly a big reason in the Northern Territory.

I think it was very foolish of the minister to take this high&amp;hyphen;handed action when it had nothing to do with ATSIC funds. While I have had a lot of arguments with Guy Parker, I believe that Guy Parker was a man who encouraged his people to get out and do things for themselves and take responsibility for their own actions.

         Reconciliation is another cherished notion. Aboriginals say to me, `What is this reconciliation business; that's about the past, isn't it? The past has gone.' That is very profound. They say, `We have to think about the future. We have to get on together.' They see that as the only future, getting on together. They see reconciliation as dredging up the past and dredging up the whole guilt industry. The two great things holding back Aboriginal development in this country are the concept of white guilt and the concept of black shame. Until Aboriginal people can come to grips with those concepts and until the wider community can come to grips with the concept of guilt, I think that Aboriginal progress will be very slow indeed.

         I support this bill, although not because it is a good bill. It is not; it is a very pedestrian bill. It has no real vision, but it seems to me that it will be very hard to do anything with this monstrosity in ATSIC that we have created. There is, in my view, however, a function for a body such as ATSIC. It should be a very small, specialised department, making sure that Aboriginals receive services in the mainstream. I believe that most of these services will come from the mainstream. It is not happening.

         In the central reserve—that area that lies between Kalgoorlie and Alice Springs—where there is a large concentration of Aboriginal people, many of the most tribal people have left. We have been providing education out there for 40 years. It would be cheaper to send every Aboriginal child to the most expensive boarding schools in Perth. We are out there pouring in the infrastructure and putting in the teachers. These are first&amp;hyphen;rate facilities. We have not got one Aboriginal kid to year 12 in 40 years.

         An Aboriginal woman recently approached me and said, `Our kids aren't getting education because they don't go to school and you don't care. If they were white kids, you'd make them go to school.' I explained to her that we made the white kids go to school because we did not care. We said, `That is the law and you are going to school.' We were so frightened of their culture that we dared not do it to them. She said, `Well, that's a lot of nonsense. It's our kids that need the education.' But if you were to mention putting in a hostel in these areas, shock horror, back to the mission days! How paternalistic! The fact that that is what they are seeking does not seem to interest anyone. In those areas we have allowed football matches to become cultural events. Football matches in some of these areas take a week—two days to get there, two days to get back and two days to play the game and get over it.

         If any Aboriginal wants a job with a mining company in Kalgoorlie, I will get him or her a job with a mining company. But the mining company legally cannot employ them unless they speak and read English. That is a breach of the mining act. It cannot employ them if they are not prepared to do shift work. It cannot employ them if they don't turn up to work and it cannot employ them if they do not turn up to work neat and tidy. They cannot meet those conditions because in most cases there is no accommodation for them. But the potential is there if we can put in the necessary infrastructure to bridge that. I believe that we can make some progress. I am actually having talks with some Aboriginal people.

         I often ask myself what the Aboriginal affairs policy is for. Is it to advance the cause of Aboriginal people? If it is, it has been very expensive and certainly not very successful. Is it, on the other hand, to placate affluent urban white middle-class guilt? In that case, it has been enormously successful. We are now at the backlash stage. People are saying, `After all we've done, nothing is happening.' I put it to members that that is not the fault of the Aboriginal people; it is the fault of the Aboriginal industry. I can tell you now there are black bureaucrats every bit as bureaucratic as white bureaucrats.

At a meeting today, I was told by ATSIC that they had been aware of this problem for over a year. They acted on it yesterday. In the meantime, there are many good communities that would not buckle to the KLC, that had been intimidated, had their funds withdrawn and were generally harassed. They are good communities, communities who have been out there trying to do something for themselves.

         Noonkanbah is a classic case. Noonkanbah is a community I know well. They had an Aboriginal bookkeeper who did a very good job. Unfortunately, his wife got sick and he went down to Perth to be with his wife. A substitute was put in who did not really know the ropes, but there was no ATSIC attempt to help. No-one said, `Look, let's give you some assistance here.' He did make a mess of the books. There was no stealing of funds at all; there was just inadequate capacity for book work. Harry came back to Noonkanbah and rectified the problem.

         So the problem is at least a year old now, but ATSIC have felt compelled to put in a grant controller and they will not release any money from Noonkanbah unless they accept the grant controller—something which the community feels is demeaning and unnecessary as they have sorted out their problem. But ATSIC explained to me they are bound by the rules and, although they recognise that the problem is actually very minor, the full draconian weight of accountability falls upon this community.

         You also see this situation in Aboriginal stations. ATSIC money is given very late in the year—often too late to be acquitted. Aboriginal communities often then get in white contractors because they know they cannot do the work in time. Our reaction is, `Those lazy so-and-sos, look, they get the gudia to do the work for them.' That is because it is a necessity. If they do not, the money has to go back or it is simply rolled over, and the money churns around and around.

I represent a very special electorate. It is intelligent, resourceful and a long way from any of the problems that the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) represents, but I can assure you that within my own electorate there is a considerable degree of concern for the welfare of indigenous Australians.

I remember the first meeting I had with the late Fred Hollows in March 1992. He said to me, `You'll probably be the next President of the AMA.' I said, `What? Are you doing my numbers?' He said, `If you get there, there are two things that you have got to do.' I said, `What's that?' He said, `The first is that you have to liberalise the AMA's attitudes to Medicare.' I said, `You had better give me the second. I hope it's easier than the first.'

        I remember my first trip to the Northern Territory. I had been there about a week and I took a team of doctors, leaders of various medical groups, out there. I must have met and spoken to over 500 Aboriginal people in the space of a week. I recall returning and speaking to the then Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the Hon. Robert Tickner, a man whose ability never matched his sincerity. I said, `I think there's a problem with ATSIC. I have just spoken to, I think, some 500 Aboriginal people. I haven't met a single person who could say anything positive about ATSIC.' In fact, even ATSIC regional councillors were criticising ATSIC. Whilst there will always be critics of any organisation, particularly a semi-government body, you know you have a problem when that happens. The minister's response to me was, `Look, Brendan, this is what self-determination is all about. I am not responsible. It's ATSIC's responsibility.' Therein lies the problem.

        This bill changes the nature of regional councils; it reduces their size; it makes open to public scrutiny meetings and documents. It empowers the Australian Electoral Commission to have more authority over the way in which elections are held. It also provides for the power to appoint an administrator. But in order for that to be done the minister has to be satisfied that the administration of the commission and of its money have involved fraud or gross mismanagement.

        Speakers on the other side of the chamber are no less or more well intentioned than those on this side. But what they have failed to recognise—and what I think the previous minister failed to recognise—is that there has been a change in mood in the Australian community generally. There is now finally—perhaps, in some small way, due to the efforts of Graham Richardson and others—a higher political priority placed on both the problems and the progress. With these rising expectations has come a significant degree of frustration. The worst thing that any government—whether it be our government or the Keating government, had it won the election—could have done for indigenous Australians would have been to have allowed it to continue.

         —I am very pleased to speak on this bill and I welcome all the members of the public who have gathered here this morning to hear my contribution on this bill. I want to say at the outset that, if the former government had introduced a bill with the purposes of this bill, that is, having first attempted to remove a board, introducing a bill to increase the number of board members, we would have been subject to a great deal of criticism, if not outrage, about our tactics. But this is precisely what the bill proposes to do.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have suggested that there is a degree of double standards in this bill, but the opposition is not going to oppose it, Mr Deputy Speaker. You might ask why not. Basically, the issue of air safety is such a serious one that no party, whether in government or in opposition, would wish to be held accountable for the obstruction of a change process, which at some point or another may lead to a calamity. So, in a sense, as is usual in government, it is on the head of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, to accept responsibility for these changes.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the amendment moved by my colleague the shadow minister, the member for Melbourne, Lindsay Tanner, we specifically say that no person should be appointed to the board who has engaged recently in political lobbying or public advocacy on aviation safety issues on behalf of any company or interest group involved in the aviation industry. Frankly, that section of the amendment could be described as the `get Dick Smith amendment'. I do not believe this is moved by personal animus but rather that someone who has taken such a high profile and partisan approach to air safety should not be part of the minister's endeavours to increase the board.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I know of a couple of the members of the existing board. Bill Fisher is the head of the Industrial Relations Commission in New South Wales. I have had the pleasure of meeting Gabi Hollows in my electorate and I think she is a first&amp;hyphen;class person to be a consumer advocate. I think it is important that we have a consumer representative. Of course, we have two other
        <break page="3111" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         members with specific expertise on the board in relation to air safety. Claire Pollock is a systems safety expert and Geoff Molloy is an ex&amp;hyphen;pilot.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In my own electorate, issues of civil aviation and air safety are of some concern to my constituents. You may recall that the former government split the old civil aviation body into two. It structurally separated Airservices Australia, which, if you like, is the operating arm, from CASA, the safety arm. I think that that was a very good move, probably long overdue. We tend in government to set up boards and statutory authorities and sometimes corporations which we invest with a great deal of independence. We believe that they should get on and do their job impartially and that there should be some distance between those bodies and the minister.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But I have to say that politics these days, or society, does not allow us that luxury. Because no matter how much the particular organisation is independent, inevitably it is the minister who ends up wearing any untoward experiences. I could use a more colourful word. But I have observed, Mr Deputy Speaker—and I know other members have observed—your very strict standards and I will resist any temptation to use such a word in conjunction with fans! So what I am saying about this bill is that Minister Sharp firstly sought to get the resignations of board members and failed, and now is introducing this bill to increase the number of board members. I do not know that we approve of the approach he is adopting, but we are certainly not going to oppose it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I mentioned that my constituents are very interested in matters of civil aviation. For example, during the last election there was quite some concern that Airservices Australia had failed to deliver the possible flight paths for Badgerys Creek airport. I think that failure, and other issues associated with Badgerys Creek, cost me and some of my colleagues dearly in the last election. I must say that whilst I am supporting the minister in relation to this bill—as the opposition is—I cannot say that I am supporting him in relation to other matters in his portfolio area having to do with civil aviation in my electorate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For example, I find it really regrettable that, more than 100 days after the election, with more than 10 per cent of the government's time having expired before the next election is due, my constituents are no better informed about Badgerys Creek than they were before the election. We have yet to see any draft guidelines for the environmental impact statement, even though we extended the date for public submissions for those guidelines from 1 March to 1 April and they were due to be released in May. Here we are at the end of June and the draft guidelines have not been produced. We do not know what the public process of comment on those draft guidelines will be. We do not know the locations of public consultation about those draft guidelines.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Furthermore, in relation to civil aviation matters in my electorate, during the last election the then government had given a commitment to set up an advising committee—one comprised of experts, but also of locals—to sit between the EIS process and the ministers. We have had no announcement of a commitment by the new government to such a body, much less the names of the people who might serve on such a committee. As I reminded the minister on my way to the House, in a way the new government has the same problem as the old government. That is, the public have to have confidence in the EIS for Badgerys Creek.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We must have a rigorous EIS process so that whatever the outcome, whether it is in favour of the airport or opposed to it, people will accept the EIS verdict. I certainly want to be in that position. I am certainly interested in any suggestions that strengthen that process and
        <break page="3112" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         would give greater credibility to the outcome of that process. But as I said to the minister, `The delay is costing you.' As each day slips by and people are no better informed, it diminishes the chances that that process will be believed.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have to say a couple of other things. It is true to say that almost every portfolio minister has reported in some way on the prospects of cuts in his portfolio area. In relation to transport and the environment, if we are to have a credible EIS process the government is going to have to invest some money in public consultation, informing people and allowing people to be satisfied that the process is fair and reasonable, and—even more than that—allowing them direct input into the process.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Public consultation delays things. Public consultation involves extra expenditure. I sincerely hope that, in relation to the EIS process, there will be no trying to save expenditure here. In saving money, the minister could very well be penny&amp;hyphen;wise and pound&amp;hyphen;foolish, as they say. On behalf of my constituents who, as I have said, are exhibiting a great deal of interest in civil aviation matters, I sincerely hope that the government will stop stonewalling on the EIS process, that it will commit to releasing the draft EIS, release the schedule of public consultation about the draft EIS and the rest of the EIS process, and also nominate the locations and the timings at which ordinary people in my electorate and in others affected by Badgerys Creek will be allowed to inform themselves and, in turn, have input into the process.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I said, to a degree there are double standards about this bill. If we had tried to sack a board or get a board to resign when we were in government, we would be have been lampooned by the press and the public. If we had attempted to introduce legislation like this to expand the board and had specifically tried to target one member of the public who was a partisan to be a new member of that board—or, indeed, to be deputy chairman of that board—again, we would have been lampooned. As I mentioned earlier, civil aviation is a very serious issue. I do not believe that any party, particularly the Labor Party as the opposition, wishes to accept responsibility in any way for any adverse outcome that may, down the track, devolve as a result of this bill and the transport minister's decision.

         —I support the amendment to the second reading motion on the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 1996 which was moved by Mr Tanner, and I will say a few things on that matter. I will also speak about some general matters on the administration of civil aviation in this country, particularly as it relates to Sydney.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I join with the member for Chifley (Mr Price) in what he has just said about the probity of the government in introducing this legislation. The absolutely outrageous pressure that the government has put on Mr Justice Fisher, who is the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, to resign has been unconscionable, in my view. The government seems to have taken the view that it should just politicise all these things. Mr Justice Fisher is a person of eminent standing and is the chief judge of the labour court in New South Wales. Before that, he was a very successful Queen's Counsel in Sydney. He is a man whose judgment is respected by all those who know him, and he is a person who is not engaged in partisan political activities, which are particularly precluded by his job as a judge.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This legislation is about the government wanting to sack Mr Justice Fisher and put one of their political stooges into this job: a fellow who spent a fortune putting out ads for the government in the last election campaign, and who is the discredited former chairman of the old board that ran civil aviation in this country for some years. He is the man who came forward with the discredited proposition of `affordable safety': Dick Smith. Dick Smith, whom
        <break page="3113" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         this bill is all about, is a fellow who has no credibility in this. He is a fellow who has spent a lot of time talking about how he is the voice of aviation.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          He is the voice of people who want to fly helicopters around the suburbs, and he is the voice of small aircraft operators, but he is certainly not the voice of the travelling public. Indeed, the travelling public in Australia does not at all like the idea of affordable safety.
         </tab>
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am sure members of this parliament, along with the business community of Australia, probably spend the greatest proportion of time travelling in aeroplanes, and the thought that there is a concept such as affordable safety is a pretty terrifying one. But that is what Mr Smith's idea was: that we should let all these things rip. While Mr Smith was able to say that there were very few airline crashes when he was the chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, I think the difficulties we have had with air safety, with commuter operators, is a direct outgrowth of Mr Smith's discredited policy of affordable safety.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Smith's argument was that we ought to let it rip; let small operators get out there and run their businesses. That ethos that filtered down in the civil aviation area and allowed for some of these more tragic occurrences in the commuter area is a direct result of the attitude that Dick Smith had when he was the supremo of the civil aviation area.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Members on the other side might say that he was an appointment of ours. Yes, he was an appointment of ours. We put him on the board and then we made him chairman. If you speak to Senator Collins, who was the minister at the time, he will tell you that it took him about 15 minutes after that to work out that Dick Smith was probably the worst chairman that we ever had. He made a number of entreaties to Mr Smith that he ought to resign and it is quite well known that the government of the day was not all that happy with Mr Smith as the chairman of that body. We did not bring in a bill to undermine him. We let him run his course and we never reappointed him. We did not bring in a bill to rearrange the board, to put someone in to look over Mr Smith's shoulder. If the government wants to do that to Justice Fisher, that is its prerogative, but it should not come in here with this sleazy tactic of expanding the board.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government talks about jobs for the boys, for goodness sake! Dick Smith is a corporate member of the Liberal Party. This is a fellow who spent a lot of his own money in the last elections putting ads in the paper for the Liberal Party. You do not get much more commitment to a party than that, where someone actually shells out their own money for big ads in the paper. But the government says, `Dick Smith? Don't think we've heard of him. We've seen a bit of him in the paper; knows a lot about aviation.' Dick Smith knows far more about the Liberal Party than he knows about aviation. The government wants to go and corrupt this body by expanding it to put its political mates on it.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I think the second reading amendment being put forward by Mr Tanner is the one that ought to be followed if the government is serious in what it says it wants to do about the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Mr Tanner's amendment states:

       <para>
        Indeed, that is the way the board is constructed now. There are people who represent the travelling public, who probably ought to have a bit of a say in what happens with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. There is a very eminent judge in Justice Fisher. There is a person
        <break page="3114" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         who has very significant experience in large jets as well as the small weekenders that Mr Smith has some expertise in. We think the board at present is a fairly well constituted board.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The important thing which is raised in the second paragraph of Mr Tanner's amendment is:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        no person should be appointed to the Board who has engaged recently in political lobbying or public advocacy on aviation safety issues on behalf of any company or interest group involved in the aviation industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suppose Mr Tanner is being quite generous there in not suggesting Mr Smith's other interest, which is the Liberal Party of Australia. I think the parliament should think very carefully about whether we want to have the discredited Dick Smith back on the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and whether we want the discredited Dick Smith running his old discredited line again of affordable safety.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is no such thing as affordable safety. In Australia we have been very lucky in this area. There have been few significant aviation disasters. Some people would tell you that that is a function of the weather here and the lack of congestion in the airways as much as it is the work of the civil aviation bureaucracy. I think that what we want in that bureaucracy are people who are going to put safety to the forefront.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I also wish to say a few things about the way civil aviation has degenerated in the Sydney basin since the government came to office. We saw the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in the election campaign, for blatant political purposes, decide that they were going to let not 1,000 flowers bloom but 1,000 planes fly anywhere and everywhere that they wanted to over the Sydney basin. Then, the week after the election, we had revealed this deal that seems to have been done with some obscure group that wishes to promote an airport at Holsworthy. In all the competitions or considerations that have been held over the previous years as to where a second airport for Sydney should be built, Holsworthy had always come in second or third last. Now we have the government promoting it to being second best.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It raises interesting questions about what this airport might be like because Holsworthy is an area that has great amounts of unexploded ordnance on the site and it is also an area that has very deep ravines and river valleys. One of the reasons that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) gave as to why he thought Holsworthy should be given consideration and why he thought Badgerys Creek was not terrific was that there were rolling hills at Badgerys Creek.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have gone from a situation where an airport site is given a downgrading in the minister's eyes because it has a rolling hills topography to one where a site that is full of ravines becomes popular all of a sudden. It just boggles the mind. I do not know; maybe the government has some new technology that will enable it to develop a machine that will explode all the unexploded bombs on the firing range there and which will blow all the dirt into the ravines so that with one big bang it will have flattened out the Holsworthy area. Unless the government has something like that in mind, then just the engineering task for turning Holsworthy into an airport is daunting, to say the least.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is also the difficulty that it will cause to the residents who live around that Holsworthy area. They all went to the election reading about the big aircraft noise debate in Sydney and thinking, `Well, with all these maps that have been drawn, we are pretty safe. No&amp;hyphen;one is talking about putting an airport in my backyard.' They then got rid of Bob Tickner because they were feeling pretty safe out there in those nice little new suburbs like Wattle Grove. Then the week
        <break page="3115" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         after the election they found there was a confidence trick—that the Prime Minister was not thinking about putting an airport out at Badgerys Creek; but there was this proposal for Holsworthy.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It turns out that these people had been to see the Prime Minister before the election. This is the Prime Minister who was going to bring honesty and probity back into the political system. But did we get one whisper of this during the election campaign? Not on your nelly, because they did not want the truth to get in the way of beating Bob Tickner in Hughes. We never heard the new member for Hughes, Danna Vale, saying anything about this during the election campaign—not a word. The people who bought houses out in Wattle Grove have just lost tens of thousands of dollars from the value of their houses. No&amp;hyphen;one in their right mind would buy a house there now. The government has tainted that area for quite some time because of its proposals to allow those real estate sharks who are behind the Lawrence Hargraves project to come out there, hoping to build an airport at Holsworthy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Also during the election campaign, we heard a few other mistruths told around the place. I remember reading in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Sydney Morning Herald
        </emphasis>
        that the Prime Minister was never going to let planes fly over the Lowe electorate. The people of Lowe had a choice: if they wanted no more aircraft noise, the simple choice was to vote for Mr Zammit; if they wanted aircraft noise, they should keep voting for Mrs Easson. If they wanted their property values to go up, they should vote for Zammit; if they wanted aircraft noise, they should vote for Easson. Unfortunately, the people of Lowe did vote for Mr Zammit. A great number of those people voted for Mr Zammit because they believed the Prime Minister when he said that there would not be planes flying over the electorate of Lowe under a Liberal Party government. They voted for him for that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But what has happened since then? We have let the thousand aircraft fly. On Saturday last, the Federal Airports Corporation's inquiry unit received nearly 400 complaints about aircraft noise in Sydney. Most of those were complaints about northerly and westerly departures. On Sunday of last week, before 5 p.m. it had received nearly 300 complaints. There are new noise hot spots occurring around Sydney now. Suburbs such as Dulwich Hill, Summer Hill, Ashfield, Concord, Petersham, Lewisham, Earlwood, Arncliffe, Haberfield and Bexley never used to experience aircraft noise, but they are now getting it on a daily basis. Currently around Sydney there are no designated flight paths. Planes taking off to the north have only to fly four nautical miles before they can turn and fly wherever they like.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have to tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not think many of those pilots or the people in the control tower heard what the Prime Minister said. I really do not think they did, because you have got a lot of planes flying over Haberfield, Croydon, Burwood and Strathfield in the electorate of Lowe. There are a lot of people complaining. I know, because my electorate is next&amp;hyphen;door, and I get the complaints from them when they have rung Mr Zammit and he has given them a mealy&amp;hyphen;mouthed explanation about not knowing that this was going to happen because John Howard said it would not happen. They ring my office and complain about these things.
       </para>

        So much for the promise made to the people of Lowe that there would be no more planes flying over Lowe, and so much for the lack of information given to the people of Wattle Grove when they concealed this idea to build an airport next to where they live. The government does not have very clean hands on this aircraft business in the Sydney basin. What we really need to see is the government, rather than just letting these planes fly everywhere, starting to give

        The great worry that I have now is that we are going to see the EIS for Badgerys Creek fall over. There is no doubt in any way, shape or form that an EIS for Holsworthy will fall over. And, in six or eight months time, we will find ourselves with no alternative site for an airport in Sydney—no site. The government will think that is pretty good, because they will tip back into the general revenue fund the money that we allocated in the budget for work at Badgerys Creek and say, `We've taken $600 million off the bottom line—and it wasn't really our fault because the EIS fell down.' But, after 10 or 15 years of planning, we will not have a site.

        We will be back to where Malcolm Fraser was when he got the report of the study on the major airport needs of Sydney. We will be back to Sydney airport, no other site, and absolute chaos for the people who live south of Sydney Harbour. The reality is that if you do not have an alternate site constructed shortly, Sydney airport will meet its capacity and you will have to do away with the curfew, you will have to do away with the cap of 80 movements an hour that the Labor government put on this airport, and you will also ensure that commuters who come from country New South Wales will not have any service into Sydney airport at all. They will have none because the government will sell these slots at the airport for landings and the pressure for the use of the airport from the major operators will keep country commuters out. What we will have in a few years time will be an impossible situation at Sydney airport.

        So the government really needs to start to think about this seriously and not get themselves caught up in the politics of: `We think the Labor Party hurt us, so we are now going to hurt Labor voters.' They probably ought, in the first instance, to stop hurting the people who voted for them—the people in Lowe and out in Hughes. And they certainly should not put a discredited person such as Dick Smith on this board. They should leave the people on the board alone so that they can do the job they were appointed to do.

         —The Civil Aviation Amendment Bill is a very small bill, with few words, but it is a bill of great significance. I have to say that, with all of my experience in relation to aviation matters and aviation safety matters, I am deeply concerned at what I see happening in aviation safety since the change in government. I fear for the minister, with whom I have a very good relationship and with whom I have worked very closely over a number of years. I will go through it as quickly as I can in the time I have available to me to set out the grounds for my fears at the course I see being undertaken.

        The bill itself, as introduced by the minister, simply expands the membership of the board. That is not a problem. A board can be any size you want it to be. I do not see any problem with that. The board could have been six, seven, nine, or whatever—that is not a problem. What concerns me is the manner in which it is being done. And what concerns me more than anything else is what is behind all of this.

        I know that when we looked at the legislation last year that set up the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, the now minister was asking questions and—I did not realise it at the time—he was pressing for more information on the powers of the minister to sack members of the board. Page 43 of the

        How can it be made more accountable to him if, at the end of the day, the minister may be able to dismiss people for noncompliance? I think it is a basic failure. If it is to be accountable, the minister must have the power to do what he ultimately feels is important, yet you are telling me he cannot quite do that.

        . It worries me that this legislation is before us now and that those thoughts were in the minister's head at that time. It is very clear that, regardless of who the members of the board who were subsequently appointed were to be, he had in mind that, were there to be a change in government, he wanted to have the power to sack the board. That is not Morris's opinion; it is simply there in the transcript where  it is set out.

        What experience? In the industry, the last person you want to put in to manage an airline operation is a pilot. Pilots are highly trained, highly specialised individuals operating a public conveyance—a piece of transport equipment.

        What you need on a board is a group of dispassionate people who are skilled in particular fields and who are able to assess the information brought forward from specialists in the field—and this is a highly technical field. You need people who are able to dispassionately look at the facts and information. Behind all this is not somebody's indulgence: this is about public safety, the most important area of public safety in this country. That is why I am so gravely concerned at what I see happening, and it is why I am concerned for the minister.

        What kind of experience will there be? It is not detailed. The minister says that aviation is a complex and detailed industry that requires people to administer it who have `appropriate qualifications'. What qualifications? I refer to the words of the Chief Opposition Whip, the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), who has just left us. I will leave them unspoken. Go back and think about his words, `What qualifications?' The qualifications are unspoken, not spoken of in the

        We have here the most critical area of public safety. We want people, as I said, who are dispassionate and skilled. Bill Fisher has to make judgments on all industrial relations matters in the state of New South Wales. He is not a plumber; he is not an electrician; he is not a clerk. He is a man skilled in his professional field. He chairs the Industrial Relations Commission in New South Wales. Yet it is said that he is unfit for this task and that he ought to go. By what principle? By what standard? By what qualification?

        If you follow through on the idea that you only have those people making decisions about aviation who can fly aeroplanes, we should not have a Prime Minister, the government should not make any decisions, and no&amp;hyphen;one in the cabinet should be dealing with aviation matters, because they are not pilots. The ludicrousness of that kind of argument! I want to see on the board decent, honest people who have good commonsense and are skilled in making decisions and are accountable: not mates.

        It is fortunate that Mr Boyd Munro is here. I am going to turn to his editorial in the AOPA magazine of April 1996. On page 3 it says:

        that won't be true. A year from now any problem in CASA will be the Minister's responsibility and his alone.

        On page 18, in another article, which is like an editorial but is not by&amp;hyphen;lined, he refers to the minister and says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        His Government have also said they will appoint members to the boards of both CASA and Airservices Australia who have real aviation experience.

        I refer you back to his words `never have a better opportunity than to do it now'. But let me go on. At page 24 of this organisation's policy—which they are entitled to have, and it is good to see they have put their minds to it—they refer to industry partnership between the bureaucracy as one of their objectives. They say:
       </para>

        Industry Partnership between the bureaucracy and operators rather than mistrust and mis&amp;hyphen;communication.

       <para>
        In a matter like this, it is not a question of partnership. A safety regulator is there to protect the travelling public, not to be in partnership with those who are to be checked or those who are to be regulated. That is not their role, but that is the policy of this organisation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What worries me even more is the tone of this. We come to page 88. The article is headed `From the desk of the CEO Bart Beech', and I am just plucking out one small bit of it in the time that is available. `Today's aviation environment' is one of the subheadings. It goes on to say:

        Those comments are very serious comments. I have made them in this place, they are in a public document, but from this moment on the minister is at risk. This organisation has compromised him. He, by his own comments on other occasions, has linked up with that, and I fear for the future of aviation safety in this country. You cannot conduct that responsibility with those kinds of relationships. All of those parties who are involved are accountable to this parliament and to the Australian public.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We go on then to Mr Smith. Firstly, you have to know where Mr Smith comes from. This is the Civil Aviation Authority annual report of 1990&amp;hyphen;91 and the chairman's comment. In this chairman's comment he refers to restructuring. He says that it will be completed in 1991&amp;hyphen;92 with progressively improved services and cost savings. In that document is a table for the reduction of staff from 727 in January 1991 down to 434 in January 1992, which is a month prior to the departure of chairman Dick Smith. But, if you look at the composition of the board
        <break page="3119" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         of which Mr Smith was the chairman and you read their background, it makes a farce of the comments of the minister and of Mr Smith and of everybody else who peddled this line about, `Put me on the board. Let me run the show because I fly an aeroplane or I used to fly an aeroplane. I know all.' I do not have time to pull that together; I will do it at a later stage.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The great mass of the people who use aeroplanes in this country are the people who use the major airlines, the regional airlines and the charter airlines, not the recreation fliers or the hobby fliers. We do not want the tail wagging the dog or the tip of the tail wagging the dog. The responsibility is to the people of this country, the major users of aviation services. If you go through and read who the members of that board were at that time when Mr Smith was chairman, as I said, it makes a farce of the comments that the minister is now making and that have been made by Mr Smith and other people.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But let me turn now to the coroner's report about Mr Smith. This is the coroner's report on the air crash of the Monarch Airlines aircraft at Young on 11 June 1993. It says on page 8:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A former Chairman of the CAA had advocated a policy of `affordable safety' which favoured a very lenient approach to policing the regulations. `Affordable safety' does not necessarily equate to `necessary safety'; in effect, it was up to each airline to decide if it was affordable to fly safely. If a plane crashes the airline is up for the cost of the plane; if the passengers and pilots are killed or injured and the airline has no assets or insurance to cover that contingency then the risk is `affordable' to the airline.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is not a Morris document; this is the coroner's report and I have quoted faithfully from it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Smith responded to that on the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         7.30 Report
        </emphasis>
        on Monday, 10 June when asked a question about whether the skies over Australia were safer before or since his time as chairman. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        For example, the first full year I was there, there was only one commercial passenger fatality. The year that I left there was zero, and that was because of hard work. We grounded aeroplanes. I read that coroner's report and it gets me mad because it's full of lies.
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, it is not a politician's statement; it is the coroner's report into a grave tragedy. The responses of the former chairman, and he who would be chairman, and of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, and any other organisation under the purview of this government, have been, `That report is full of lies.' The lawyers will sort that out. If the report is full of lies, that will be disclosed by the lawyers in the litigation that obviously will flow from it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But I keep coming back to the point that I am greatly worried by what I see and what I hear. There are influences at work—some are seen and some are unseen—and there are obviously nods and winks involved in all of this. Then I turn to our report and Mr Smith's claim that safety was best in his year of office. That is a nonsense. We dealt with this in the report. The current minister was a party to this unanimous report and the working committee that prepared the report. He knows, as I know, what Mr Smith did, and the words that we wrote about that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Smith removed crew members who died in the crash and the reason given for this fatal accident was crew foolishness. A government decision was that regulations should protect third party and property, not people. In other words, if a crew member died, he did not count that because a crew member should not have conducted himself or herself in a way that led to his or her death.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Then he wanted to include balloon passengers. I do not know of any regular public transport service that transports people by balloon. You can have joy rides in them. But he included
        <break page="3120" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         balloons in one year and excluded crew deaths in another year. The committee's words which start in paragraph 3.30 were:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This is an arbitrary and absurd way of compiling and interpreting statistics. Similarly, it is very doubtful whether ballooning accidents qualify for inclusion in official statistics because ballooning is not a recognised mode of transport . . . There are very broad and general reasons for causal connections. If Smith had been able to show, for example, that outputs had increased (eg increased number of ramp checks)—

        that is, that more work had been done

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Then I go on further to the matter, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I mentioned to you the other day in your capacity as chairman of the communications, transport and micro&amp;hyphen;economic reform committee, and that is the advice to you by the minister in his letter of 20 June. It says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As you are aware, I recently publicly foreshadowed a review of Australia's aviation safety regulations—

       <para>
        and so on. He continues:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I envisage that the issues identified in the Plane Safe Report of December 1995 . . . will be among the matters considered as part of this review. Accordingly, I consider that any further consideration of such aviation safety matters by the Committee should await completion of the foreshadowed regulatory review. I will ensure that the Committee is kept fully briefed on the work of the review.
       </para>
       <para>
        That adds to my worry. In this letter the minister said: `Aviation safety inquiry examination is out of bounds for this committee. The unanimous report to the parliament adopted in full by the previous minister and in process of being implemented, we are looking at again. There are several revisions yet to come, but that committee is out of bounds for them.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I do not know whether the minister, with the best will in the world, is fully aware of the implications of this, and I am putting my comments to him in this way: I do not know whether he really realises what he has created and the situation in which he has been placed. I suspect in a way that he is being manipulated. It is a bit like the artificially inseminated cow: she knows that something is happening, but she is not quite sure how it is happening.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If it were something of a trivial nature, I would not be so concerned; we could laugh about it. But, in this case, this is the most important safety matter in this nation, next to some medical matter or a plague, or something of that nature. The millions of Australians that travel by air are entitled to expect that aviation safety regulation matters will be administered properly. When they are on a plane up there, those safety regulations should be inviolate. They should not be influenced by personal grudges, financial interests, briefs, or anything else. What worries me greatly is that comment in AOPA's magazine about Leroy Keith.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I read through the minister's statement a few days ago on the review of regulations that is going to be announced tomorrow. Again, he has put himself in the position where, on the one hand, he is attacking staff members of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. I do not know who is writing this stuff for him. I do not know who is providing this advice. But whoever it is obviously does not understand the ramifications of what they have done to their minister. They have sat him up there nicely; he is sitting on the point of the spear. He is not going to be able to move one millimetre—forwards, backwards or sideways—because you cannot, as a minister, be accountable to the parliament, be responsible for aviation safety in this country and, at the same time, be hammering the people that are responsible for carrying out that policy.

         So in this legislation, simple as it is, the board membership does not matter. It does not matter whether it is three, whether it is nine, or whether it is 10. It is what is behind it, Minister. It is what advice you are being given, and I do not think you are being given the benefit of the best advice that is available or impartial advice. But the position has now changed. As Boyd Munro says, in six months—come 2 September—you will be responsible for everything. Today is 27 June. There is not long to go. That is why I would have been much happier if I had seen in what you were doing, what you were saying in respect of our report and what you were saying in respect of this matter, something that much more closely adhered to the views you had and the utterances you made as a member of the committee, in the valuable work that you carried out in the preparation of the

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, the purpose of the amendments that I have circulated is to give the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) the power to dismiss the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and to appoint a new board made up of members with aviation experience. As a member for an area with strong commercial and private aviation activity, I am most concerned for the safety of regional aviation in particular. When he was in opposition, the minister was recognised around Australia as one of CASA's outspoken critics. He has been an outspoken and authoritative spokesman for air safety and has done much to elevate this issue to national debate, particularly after the Seaview and Monarch crashes.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So, I believe the minister has a mandate to honour his pre&amp;hyphen;election commitment to appoint to the board people with appropriate aviation experience, not simply to dilute a board appointed by a former minister by adding two new members. It is completely at odds with the coalition's pre&amp;hyphen;election promise to reduce the size of government. Only one member of the existing board has any previous aviation experience. Appointing two new members with experience will not ensure that the board that oversees aviation safety in this country will still have a majority of members with aviation experience. I accept that the government may be forced to pay out fees for those directors it would remove, but I believe that would be a small price to pay to reassure public confidence in our aviation industry.

        Mr Deputy Speaker, Australians once took pride in having the world's safest aviation industry. The Seaview and Monarch crashes have critically undermined that confidence. We are talking about a board specifically charged with aviation safety—not the ABC or a public service board—and that places special onus on the government and the minister. The recent findings of the Monarch inquest display the serious shortcomings in overseeing the safety standards in our industry. While the current board certainly cannot be blamed for the Monarch disaster, the fact remains that the people who let those operators continue to fly are still doing

        However, these people, who are now giving advice to the new board, were in place when a plane carrying two young men crashed in the Blue Mountains en route to Forbes on 3 October 1993. But for a mobile ELT—emergency locator transmitter—Scott Grezl and Hamish Wallace could well be alive today. They died slow and lingering deaths, over many hours in one case, and perhaps 15 days in another; their plane, and its fixed ELT, burnt beyond any use. The ELT was in fact inoperative, out of sight, out of mind and not hand&amp;hyphen;held. As a news editor covering this protracted case, I spoke with relatives and investigators and was horrified at the waste of these lives and in fact the entire search process.

        The current board of CASA still refuses, as I understand it, to approve portable ELTs, although they are in use in jumbos. I do not believe the current board has the expertise to make a sound judgment on this or on any other air safety issue nor will it have majority expertise under the government's proposals. It is essential that public confidence in our aviation industry is restored. It is essential that the federal parliament shows leadership on this issue and does not just take the easy way out. The Civil Aviation Amendment Bill, as it stands, is a Clayton's bill: the one you have when you don't have a bill. My amendments give this bill the clout it needs, and it effectively precludes any spill over of the legislation into other areas so it will not impact on other statutory bodies.

        I have reason to believe many aircraft operators, including major operators, are strongly opposed to what they see as a weak response by the minister to a serious problem. Max Hazelton, the founder of Hazelton Airlines, a regional operator in my electorate with an enviable safety record, also sees an urgent need for real change and that can only come from an experienced board. These amendments are designed to allow the minister to address what the industry and the flying public require—that is, the need for the government to control the efficiency and, most importantly, the safety of the airline industry.

        I have had indications that the government will not support my amendments even though it favours them. It has been suggested to me that my delaying the bill's passage is cementing in place the board that does not have the minister's additions to it. The minister's amendment on the structure of the board is a Clayton's amendment. Any delay is not my problem. My problem is the safety of the air travelling public and the need for a minister to have full confidence in the board, and through them, the organisation charged with air safety. The minister's problem can be easily solved. Support my amendments. I will be seeking a detailed discussion and that this bill go back to the House with an unresolved question.

        Keeping an eye on what has been said earlier today, I would like to pass a few comments in relation to previous speakers. Firstly, I refer to some comments made by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) and thank him for his contribution. I note his comments in regard to the EIS guidelines. They are the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), who will be drawing those up. It is my hope that that will be done as quickly as possible because this process needs to be set in place as quickly as we can to alleviate concerns in Sydney about the site for a second airport.

        The honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) was up to his usual game of politics, as ever, and made a number of comments, one of which related to the campaign of the honourable member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) in the recent election. The honourable member for Watson somewhat changed some of the promises made by the now member for Lowe by claiming that Mr Zammit had promised there would be no aeroplanes over the seat of Lowe if you voted for him but that there would be aeroplanes over the seat of Lowe if you voted for Mary Easson, the then sitting member for the Labor Party.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is not a true and accurate account of the promises made by the now member for Lowe in his election campaign. The commitments at that time were that there would be no new flight

         paths. The reference there to `new' was in relation to flight paths that existed prior to November 1994. Prior to the opening of the third runway there were a number of well-established flight paths that existed in the electorate of Lowe and the commitment was that there would be no new flight paths. Certainly, to our knowledge to date, that commitment has not been broken. So it is inaccurate and unfair of the member for Watson to try to interpret the words of the member for Lowe during the election campaign and try, therefore, to paint him as not having lived up to the promises he made in that campaign.

        He also said that our decision to introduce slots for Sydney airport was a ruse to raise revenue, as I think he put it, and that we would sell these slots off to the highest bidder. That is not our intention. We are negotiating with industry at the present time as to the best mechanism we can use. We are setting up two committees in industry to assist us in coming to a proper and fair mechanism for the allocation of slots.

        One of the things I want to assure the House about, and this would be of particular interest to the member for Calare (Mr Andren), being a representative of a regional area, particularly one that is so noted for its aviation services, is that there will be dedicated slots for Sydney airport for regional airline operations. We can guarantee through this process that regional airline operations will still have access to Mascot airport.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is something that I know regional representatives from the New South Wales area would be particularly interested in. And I, of course, representing a regional part of New South Wales with a number of aviation services currently flying into Mascot Airport, would also view it as important that, in establishing a slot process for Sydney's airport operations, regional airlines are given their fair share of those slots. That is part of the process. We are going to guarantee that. Indeed, if we did not do it this way, the possibilities of regional airline operations being squeezed out of Mascot would be much greater if we did not have a proper slot management process. That is what the slot allocation process is all about.

        I will also talk about the comments made by the honourable member for Watson in regard to affordable safety. He belittled the terminology and the philosophy behind it. Whilst affordable safety is not a term I would necessarily use myself, I think you cannot argue the logic of affordable safety. Everything that we do in life in relation to safety is measured by our ability to afford it. We only have limited resources to allocate to safety and we have to allocate them to the best of our ability.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If we did not do that, everybody would own a Mercedes motorcar, because we know Mercedes motorcars are safer in car crashes than driving around in a Volkswagen. Yet Mercedes motorcars are more expensive than Volkswagens, therefore people in their normal daily lives have to make a judgment about safety based upon their ability to afford it. So the logic of affordable safety is just a fact of life; it is something we cannot deny. I do not know whether I would have necessarily used the terminology. At any rate, it has been used. But the honourable member for Watson should not be mischievous in trying to denigrate the philosophy behind that.

        That is why this legislation is before the House today. It is important for us to have people who have relevant expertise and experience in aviation administering aviation safety regulation on a day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day basis for us. Unfortunately, of the four non&amp;hyphen;executive directors of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board, only one has any relevant experience; the others do not—hence the principle behind the Civil Aviation Safety Act amendment that we have put before the parliament at this time.

        I go to the particular amendments to the bill. I thank the member for Calare for his proposed amendments and for the sentiments behind them. However, the intent of the amendments go well beyond what the government would propose, which is simply to ensure that the board has members with appropriate aviation experience. They touch on broader policy issues which relate to statutory authorities generally, and the coalition government will address those issues separately.

        I thank the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), for his amendment to the motion for the second reading. I consider his first point inappropriate, as the bill before the House does not preclude appointment of people with the types of experience suggested. On his second point, I would have to question the intent of the provision, and I do not consider that the House can provide such a broad test to this, or any other, board. It seems, therefore, that the opposition may have a vendetta against an individual or individuals.

        It is extraordinarily hypocritical on the part of the opposition that, when in government, it made appointments such as that of Bill Kelty to the Board of the Reserve Bank, yet would now require the House to limit this government with regard to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The government does not therefore support the amendment to the motion for the second reading.

        I conclude by saying that this is a very important issue. I know everybody has their personal views about particular people and particular processes, and that they have some loyalties to those people and processes. But I say to the House that this is a very important issue. I know the people who have spoken on this bill treat it as such. We have seen a number of accidents in recent years which can be attributed in part to the failure of the Civil Aviation Authority of old. Indeed, it could well be that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority at this time is still not sufficiently reformed to ensure that we have an authority that is going to deliver the safest aviation regime for Australia. It is a very serious matter. We should not treat it lightly.

        I thank members who have contributed to this debate. The thing that we take as an overriding principle in all of this is that, in an area that is so important to the safety of millions of Australians every year, we have people on the board governing the safety regulator who have appropriate experience and qualifications and understand the technical aspects of aviation and its language, history and culture, and who therefore are in a position to make sensible, proper and appropriate judgments without delay, thus ensuring that people who use our air services around Australia have an organisation regulating aviation safety that is driven by the best possible available expertise.

          —In my haste to get up here, I actually left some notes of mine behind. But I have had time to carefully go through the government response, and I would like to say a few things, including some that I said when the report was tabled.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This was a bipartisan committee. The report reflected the good work of all committee members. I am a little disappointed that some of those members, for one reason or another, were not returned to the parliament.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I guess that when you table reports you do not expect that all of the recommendations will be embraced. I think that is true of this report. As I said when I tabled this report, I felt that it was not so much that the recommendations would be tested as that, rather, the government's response would be tested against how many of the recommendations were adopted. Whilst I understood that some might provide difficulty, I was really surprised at how many were rejected.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Perhaps the most controversial proposal was the abolition of the undergraduate program at ADFA, and its replacement with a scholarship scheme. I think it is fair to say that committee opinion varied; there were a range of views, from strongly endorsing it to thinking it should at least be considered. Therefore, I find the minister's response—and the government's response—to the recommendation particularly poor. I think it is a little mendacious and somewhat cavalier, if not irresponsible.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I will just go through the arguments again, because I have been attacked in the paper over this. We spend $200 million on the professional development of some 11,000 officers. There are about 1,000 officer cadets at ADFA. They consume $100 million. The scholarship scheme would save $60 million. If you paid for the 1,000 university places from the defence budget and put in additional places in the 37 other universities, the saving would be $50 million. That is not an inconsiderable saving. Defence applies a number of methodologies to its approach to all aspects of its work. One is `value for money'—those are not my words. ADFA does not, I believe, survive that first and most basic test: providing value for money.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Secondly, the previous government introduced a commercial support program which really suggested that defence needed to stick to its defence kitty for core activities, and that individuals or private enterprises could provide services: that there ought to be a competitive
         <break page="3129" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          regime, and the most successful tenderer should win. They have been doing this for some years.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Is it argued that the training of undergraduates is a core activity of the Defence Department? I do not believe it. Indeed, there are 37 other universities who graduate 132,000 students. ADFA graduates 300 a year. I think it is absolutely preposterous to suggest that developing undergraduates is a core activity of the Defence Department.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There has been some light&amp;hyphen;hearted reference, if you like, to this idea that there is value in the future officer corps of Australia understanding their cohorts' values and beliefs, as they would if they were going to other universities. That is, given that the ADF seeks to serve the community, the community is important to the ADF and you cannot start this too early. I passionately believe that. But it is suggested that, if some of the female cadets play netball and the men put their bums in a scrum, somehow they have these wonderful discussions about belief systems, values and attitudes where this is all picked up on their sporting activities. This is just absolute nonsense.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But, most importantly of all the arguments, the particular one I wish to advance has received too little attention. That is that when young people have determined upon a career, have narrowed it down and have signed up for that career, they want to get into the action as quickly as possible. What ADFA does is incarcerate them straight out of high school, and it can be up to six years after signing on to be an infantryman, or to drive a ship or to pilot a plane, before they actually do it. I suspect this large gap has an impact on separation rates and I challenge the minister, in his cavalier rejection of the recommendation, to look at the separation rates. Just start watching those separation rates, because I suspect there is every chance that ADFA graduates may have higher separation rates than the rest.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are some other arguments I want to advance as well. It is said that this provides a unique environment to inculcate the military ethos and the profession of arms. If it is so unique, if it is so beneficial, why don't all officers go through it? Why don't we scrap direct entry and why don't we put all other rank officer candidates through ADFA? Of course, there is a simple reason: we cannot afford it. That is the first thing. Let me propose something you may find faintly ridiculous. If this is so important, if this is so essential and everything that follows after ADFA has so little impact on military ethos and the profession of arms, why don't we start incarceration at age 13? Why don't we have a sister high school, or several high schools, located in and around ADFA and we will start this incarceration process at that age? It is a ridiculous argument. But then I think the opposition has been ridiculous as well.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I also want to completely reject the argument that it is too early to judge. I do not care what the institution is that we establish, it is always appropriate that there be reviews and finetuning and that people have an opportunity to revisit the issue. There is the suggestion that it is only when we get a CDF who has graduated from ADFA that we will know for certain whether the institution has served us well or not served us well. Certainly, in relation to ADFA, within the committee the range of opinions was from `strongly for' to `at least ought to be considered'. I am the first one to acknowledge it. But I must say I am particularly disappointed in the response.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to cover a few other issues and one of them is jointery. I believe jointery was pioneered in a very good way at ADFA. But I do not believe that the ADF can continue with the farce of saying that one of the best features of ADFA is jointery—and I accept that—but we are going to preclude people from jointery until they get up to the Command and Staff
         <break page="3130" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          College. You cannot be half in and half out. If jointery is worthwhile, we need to maintain it. That is why I still stand by the committee's recommendation about looking at the feasibility of a tri&amp;hyphen;service pre&amp;hyphen;commissioning college.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government's rejection of co&amp;hyphen;locating the separate colleges—that is, the WRAN Staff College, the Army Command and Staff College and the RAAF Command and Staff College, all integrated into a tri&amp;hyphen;service ADF Command and Staff College located in Canberra, with the common military curriculum and tri&amp;hyphen;service elements in it—I find appalling. It was one of the things that really surprised me. I note in the government response that they are going to do a further review.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         They propose, at best, the co&amp;hyphen;locating of the three colleges; all in one location but with no common military core training and no integration of the colleges. We will have three colleges smack&amp;hyphen;bang in the one location. What an absolute farce. There may be some savings in that, but they would be minuscule. It will not be jointery. It goes completely against the thrust of that. I would be surprised if this approach attracted the support of the Public Works Committee, whom they will inevitably have to consult. I am absolutely convinced that one day we will see tri&amp;hyphen;service pre&amp;hyphen;commissioning and we will see a single command and staff college with common subjects and single&amp;hyphen;service elements in it as well.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One issue in the committee's report which I had thought was understood—in fact, I thought it was quite reasonable—was, again, rejected. It was that there are two elements to officer training. The first is the officers' professional development and education, which we were privileged to review and which the nine separate colleges all administer, at a cost of $200 million. The second element is the war fighting skills that are inevitably associated with the profession of arms. This was outside the terms of reference of the committee—and, in fact, having reviewed it, I do not know that any committee of the parliament would feel too comfortable about it—but, having made what I think were fairly fundamental and significant recommendations for change on the one side, if you were going to change any of that, you really needed to have looked at the other side and made sure that it all fitted into a continuum. That particular recommendation has been really misunderstood, as far as I can tell, in the government's response.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would like to return to a couple of things about the scholarship scheme. What incredibly bad timing it was to table this report on the day of national protest, when every university campus was up in arms about possible loss of staff, loss of funding or increases in HECS! The most pampered, gold plated institution in Australia will not lose one staff member, and we will not be saving one dollar of expenditure. Under the scholarship proposal recommended in the committee's report, it is nonsense to say that the ADF cannot be guaranteed a supply of university graduates. This is the only way, as the government's response tries to argue.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me refer to the number of students previously. In 1993, in science, engineering, humanities and arts, which are the faculties that ADFA draws from, a total of 132,860 students graduated. To say that offering a scholarship for these people would not guarantee a supply is rubbish. The ready reserve scheme puts people with a university degree into the officer corp, it puts people into the reserve and also into the other ranks. I happen to think that is a good thing.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In conclusion, I think there are a couple of things that will be of absolute and fundamental significance to Defence. The first is the Glenn review, which has been published, and the second is Army 21. I also want to acknowledge, as I did previously, the contributions of the

In saying that to you, I also extend to the government the fact that I think it is important, when there is a response from the government on a committee's recommendations, that there is an opportunity to debate them either here or, preferably, in the other place.

I am one of those who thinks we were far better when we sat for three weeks and had one week off. It gave continuity to debate, allowed for reasonable consideration of issues and we got far more out of parliament. I know this Main Committee is an adjunct, and that we are all given a chance to say our tuppence worth, but I still feel that it does not equate with the capacity to debate issues in parliament. I see it as an excuse rather than anything else. I think it is very important that we do not just set aside forever the nature and character of discussions regarding the function of this Main Committee and the House. I hope that, at some stage, we can revert back to having more debate within the parliament itself, particularly on issues such as this.

I am delighted to see Gillian here. Gillian put a lot of effort into her Defence commitment and indeed is one of the few who went to the Joint Services Staff College. For those of you who are cadets, it is down near the sewerage farm, down that end of town! I can assure you that those who come out of the college are far different from that that goes into the adjacent works. It is a very worthwhile facility and one which is part of the area that we examine in this report.

         I now turn to a few issues in the report itself. If governments are going to respond to a committee's report, I do not think that they should present a response which is as inadequate as this.

         . At the moment, we are dealing with the government's response. It is a very thin document. The report is quite a worthwhile tome, and

        <para first-indent="16">
         Because I have only a few minutes, I want to talk about some of the detail. There are three areas, in particular, which I want to address. The first is staff colleges. The response by the government on staff colleges was, to say the least, totally inadequate. We all recognise that it is very hard for members of parliament to actually produce a report with sufficient analysis, detail and background for all of its recommendations to be implemented. But one area of officer education which stands out as needing reform is that of staff colleges.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For the audience, I will say that there are different levels of officer education, and staff colleges are the colleges to which officers go when they are at the captain or major level. They have been platoon commanders; in other words, they have had junior responsibilities and have looked after platoons. At the stage at which they move to becoming more administrative and embracing wider responsibilities, they go to staff colleges.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Demonstrably, the navy, the army and the air force each have different requirements. We may not have adequately addressed those in the report, but we certainly attempted to ensure that we looked at the requirements for each service and then looked at the combined requirements for tri&amp;hyphen;service education. We felt that it was obvious that there needed to be some rebuilding of the facilities. The government has acknowledged that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The government has also said it might look at collocating staff college facilities. But we went beyond that; we said that it would be a very good idea if the three staff colleges were collocated in Canberra and, within that combined staff college, you provided a combination that provided, in some part, for common education across the three services. Although you may be wearing an army uniform, there will quite often be a requirement for you to work with members of the other two armed forces. I think it is particularly important that that tri&amp;hyphen;service education at the staff colleges be promoted.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Frankly, I do not accept the government's response to this. I feel that the integration of the three staff colleges is not only desirable but essential. I believe that, in addition to tri&amp;hyphen;service training, you can provide  supplementary individual training to meet the differing requirements of the three services. For example, the naval course is much shorter than the army course, but I do not accept that you cannot overcome that by giving each service whatever that service wants, in its particular form, after meeting what I see as an essential tri&amp;hyphen;service obligation. So I certainly reject that part of this report.
         </tab>

        <para first-indent="16">
         The next part of the report that concerns me is the half&amp;hyphen;baked response to our suggestion that distance education is a way by which you can supplement military education. One of the real problems is that many senior appointments in the services are made from among people who have had no opportunity to go to staff college. It is true that many of you may well go on to some form of tertiary education. Some of you might go to the services, some of you might go to university and some of you might go to TAFE. It does not matter where you go; in whatever career you follow, you will ultimately come to the position where that career is helped by the education you had before you got there. Where you have not had the opportunity to go to university or to do a particular course at a TAFE college, there are other opportunities, if you are in the civilian stream. Many of them are achieved through distance education.

          It cannot replace all of them, but you can provide some opportunity to have people in a staff college for a relatively short period of time, if you cannot send them there for 12 months. One of my worries with the staff college course is that 12 months is a long period to take out of a middle level officer's life, but there is no reason that you cannot take him in for occasional two&amp;hyphen;week intensive periods and let him do some of the academic work by distance education. I thought that response was inadequate.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is necessary that the services have more flexibility in the way in which they provide advanced training for their officers, and distance education is a very good way by which it can be achieved. Indeed, I have been interested to see, as I have moved around service facilities around Australia—and I commend them for it—how many senior officers have taken university degrees. A former senior officer is sitting alongside me at the moment: the member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who is a former Commodore in the Royal Australian Navy. He took several university degrees while he was a serving officer in the services.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The point is that there are ways by which you can combine intensive in&amp;hyphen;service training by going to particular facilities. I see no reason why you cannot go to the tri&amp;hyphen;service staff college, as we envisage, for whatever the period might be. It might be a fortnight or it might be a few weeks; but you could do it in such a way as to supplement that distance learning. I certainly think the services need to pursue that concept further.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Because the most fundamental of the recommendations related to ADFA, the Australian Defence Force Academy, and it was one of the prime recommendations of the committee—although not one that was universally endorsed—I wanted to say a few things before I close on that subject. There are three aspects to officer training that we need to consider. The first is the state of our economy. At the moment, because there is high unemployment, the nature of people entering at different levels of the Defence Force is different from that at a time of full employment.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Indeed, in the recruiting to the ready reserves, the number of young men and women who have joined the ready reserves, not just because they would like the opportunity, the discipline and the training but also because it is a vehicle by which they can get a tertiary education, has been remarkable. My worry about the employment market is that, as we move into full employment—and they are already having difficulties in recruiting sufficiently in each of the three services at ADFA—that position could get worse.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The second aspect, of course, is the security situation. As I began by saying, everyone hopes that peace will continue and, therefore, there is not a suggestion of having to recruit people for some urgent military confrontation. The third aspect is just as important, and that is to try to look at a phrase which I notice several people have criticised because they did not like it and which came from an academic from New Zealand. It has always appealed to me, and it is the term `the military after next'. Sure, it is a jargon phrase. It is like `multiculturalism'—a word which I do not particularly like but which covers something that we all understand.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          When we talk about `the military after next', we are talking about the officers who are going to command the Australian Defence Force in the 21st century, and we try to look beyond those who are now serving to the character and nature of the force after the present one. We were trying to see whether we could augment present training opportunities. Again, we did not come down with a final, definitive recommendation; we looked at a number of flexible options.
         </para>
         <break page="3134" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          <para first-indent="16">
           My worry with the rejection of the committee's report is not that perhaps, after consideration, it may be too early for the change, but that to say that the report lacks substantive and sufficiently detailed reasoning to justify such a proposal—when the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) is now, properly, looking at university education right across Australia—seems to me to be saying, `It does not matter what is happening in every other tertiary institution in Australia, we are not going to look at what is happening at ADFA.'
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           That might be going too far but, frankly, there is justifiable reason for us to make sure that taxpayers get value for their dollar and that those who are students get the best possible education, and not just an education for education's sake. Really, education is what you remember when you have forgotten what you have learnt. When you leave school, those things which you remember are going to be the reason that you went to school. The learning that you do in order to pass exams or to become non&amp;hyphen;commissioned or commissioned officers in the cadet corps or wherever is all the product of particular subjects. But education is something that lasts well beyond what you may forget in the day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day rigours of the subjects you take, either in the Defence Force or at school.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           As far as ADFA is concerned, I think it is an excellent training opportunity, but I think it is too restricted. I do not believe that it necessarily provides the only way by which you can train future officers. I grant you that there are other ways of admission. Of all the evidence given to us, what struck me was the advice from the then commander of Duntroon, who told us that, six months after he had had ADFA cadets in Duntroon, he could not tell the difference between ADFA cadets and those who had come in as direct entry. I know that, certainly in the air force, where I have had some experience, often those who are very good officer material are not necessarily good pilots.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           So, I am concerned at the response on ADFA. I think that it is too narrowly based. I think there is reason in looking at ways by which the initial entry of officer cadets can be modified and changed. I am disappointed that the government perhaps has not given more time and attention to what I see as fundamental in shaping the nature and character of the `military after next'.

It was not tailored the way it happened this morning; it just happened that they were coming, and we thought that, rather than do the program that they were going to do, they should come and listen to something which was relevant to the future careers of a lot of them. So, I welcome them here this morning. I hope that what we have to say is of value to them.

         In particular, I would like to pay tribute to one of their number, who is sitting right behind me over here—Major Bryce Rogers, who has just retired. Earlier in the week I did acknowledge in writing to Bryce the very substantial contribution that he has made to the cadet movement in southern Queensland, in the Toowoomba area, over many years—far more than perhaps he wants to remember. Nevertheless, he has made a very large contribution. These students here this morning, members of 13 RCU, are drawn from both public and private
         <break page="3135" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          schools in the Toowoomba area. I welcome them once again to listen to this debate—albeit a very abbreviated debate—on what is a very major subject.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Can I say first of all, Mr Deputy Speaker, that of course the cadet movement is important to the future of our nation and to the Australian Defence Force. I hope that, in the context of the 20 August budget, we will see some of the rhetoric of the coalition in opposition converted into substance. We did give an undertaking in the policy document, in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the election, that we would do something substantive in the area of cadets. I hope that that will, in fact, be carried through in the context of that budgetary setting.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So, with that said, it is a pleasure for me once again to stand in this Main Committee room and to talk briefly about this very important report and, in so doing, to follow two very eminent people—on the other side, and now in opposition, the former Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price); and, alongside me, a longstanding member, in fact the father of the House, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who is also, as I have said to the young people who are here today, a former and very eminent Minister for Defence.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am sure that, if they take on board what Mr Sinclair has had to say briefly here today, it will stand them in good stead this afternoon when they go to the Australian Defence Force Academy. I thought it appropriate that they should come in and listen to some comments about a report which is very important to where a lot of them are heading.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I just want to mention three recommendations in this report. There are 23 recommendations in the report, and I agree with the right honourable member for New England in his criticism of the brevity of the government's response. I think it is perhaps a little too brief. But I have to say that I agree in general terms with what it has said. It goes back to the substance of what was in this very substantial document. As the right honourable member will recall, I did have some reservations, within the privacy of the joint standing committee. When the report was actually tabled, the wording was used so that people like me could stand up and, while not wanting to oppose what was being recommended, at least indicate that I had some strong reservations about some aspects of what it was recommending.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is not to say that, as a former long&amp;hyphen;serving naval officer, I was predisposed to a certain position in relation to the development of the officer corps, but that I thought that what was being proposed, particularly in relation to the Defence Force Academy, was premature, bearing in mind one or two points that I will come to in a moment. What I would like to do briefly is go through three particular recommendations—bearing in mind that, of the 23 recommendations, 13 have been accepted by the government either in principle or in part, or are under review. So it has been substantially agreed to by the government in a lot of areas. But, as in some of the points made by the right honourable member for New England, some of the areas where the committee recommended a major change have not been followed through.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The three areas that I would like to briefly address are, first, pre&amp;hyphen;commissioning colleges; secondly, staff colleges; and, thirdly, the Defence Force Academy. In relation to the pre&amp;hyphen;commissioning colleges, which are in recommendation 11 of the report, I think in hindsight—although I did make this point in the context of the committee hearings and in the development of the report—that too much emphasis was put on the need for jointery. For the benefit of 13 RCU, what we mean by that is the degree to which the army, navy and air force are working together in a very disciplined and formalised sense. I felt—and it has been the feeling of the
         <break page="3136" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          government response—that perhaps it is too early to do that, although I have to say that the response also indicates that it is an open door and they will continue to review that.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The existing single service colleges—whether they be at Point Cook, Duntroon or Jervis Bay—are making a major contribution in terms of the non&amp;hyphen;degree stream. Perhaps we should not move as quickly as the report was indicating should be done in the very short term. So I tend to agree with the government response on recommendation 11. But, at the same time, I also agree with the right honourable gentleman that the response is somewhat brief—some would say too brief. But the door is open and it will continue to be reviewed within the Department of Defence and within the three services. That is the first point on recommendation 11 on pre&amp;hyphen;commissioning colleges and the need to perhaps continue with those single service colleges without injecting into the military equation the need for too much jointery too early in the career of officer trainees. That is basically what that report is all about—bringing into a joint environment the three single service colleges much earlier than is the present situation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second point I would like to discuss briefly is in relation to staff colleges. As the right honourable gentleman has said—and I think I agree—the response from the department, certainly in the response document, was somewhat inadequate. In fact, a lot could be done in terms of the staff colleges. At the moment, the staff colleges—again for the benefit of 13 RCU—are: at HMAS
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Penguin
         </emphasis>
         at Balmoral, Sydney, for the navy; at Queenscliff, Victoria, for the army; and at RAAF Fairbairn, Canberra, for the air force.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think we all agreed in the committee that there was room to manoeuvre in terms of a core curriculum for those three colleges, to bring them together much more than they are at the moment, and then to have some sort of single&amp;hyphen;service training in conjunction with this core approach.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That has not been agreed by the government. It is one of the recommendations that did have a lot of validity and could have been done in the short term. I just hope that the two ministers for defence, in conjunction with the defence department bureaucracy, the commander of the defence force and the three chiefs of staff, are going to look more carefully at the situation of the staff colleges. I agree with Mr Sinclair that that particular one is disappointing. A lot could have been done in the short to medium term, albeit that there would have been budgetary implications. Those budgetary implications could have been programmed into what is a very extensive budget indeed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would like to talk briefly about the Australian Defence Force Academy. The report says that the present arrangements should be terminated and that we should go back to an undergraduate scheme utilising all the universities around Australia which, of course, was the previous course of action.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I disagree with that; it is not a fundamental disagreement, because the government's response also says that it will be kept under review. The reason that I say it is inappropriate at this point in time is that nobody who has graduated from the Defence Force Academy, to my knowledge, has yet achieved the rank of major. It is probably a little too early to do it. So whilst I do not oppose totally what is in the report in terms of a review of it, I do oppose the specifics of recommendation 14 that the Defence Force Academy arrangements should be terminated. I think that that will be reviewed in the coming years. I agree with Mr Sinclair that we should have an open mind about it, and that really is reflected in the government's response.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One specific point in relation to the cadet movement: I think all of us and the Australian nation need to understand the very parlous conditions and the very ad hoc arrangements under
         <break page="3137" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          which young men and women like this have to operate. It is very difficult for them to get basic uniforms and equipment, and whilst we do not want to get involved here this morning in the mechanics of the present rather vociferous public debate on firearm reform proposals, it is difficult for a lot of groups like 13 RCU to really feel that they are part of something leading up to a meaningful career if they do not have some of the basics. I want to take the opportunity to place on the

         Those are important points to make in the context of a debate which is not only related to the officer corps. I agree with the right honourable gentleman that the `military after next' is a very catchy phrase; it is appropriate under the circumstances. It is important also to make mention of some of these points in a wider portfolio, a wider strategic viewpoint, because young people like those we have here today need to understand some of these things.
