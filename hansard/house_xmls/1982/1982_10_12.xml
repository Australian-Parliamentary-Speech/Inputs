       When I gave notice of that motion in this House on 23 September I did so in good faith and on the basis of the information which was then available to me. Since then I have had no reason to change my mind about the justification for moving that motion. Indeed, investigations which have been carried out on my behalf and by me during the fortnight's recess since I gave notice of that motion confirm to me the need for this matter to be debated. An opportunity should be given to me to present what I regard as substantial evidence which, at least prima facie, establishes the need for a more thorough analysis of this matter than that which has been extended to it by the Government through the Taxation Commissioner to this point.
      </para>
      <para>
       The letter of the Taxation Commissioner is unexceptionable as far as I am concerned. The Commissioner says that in relation to six companies Mr Reid has, and they have, no unsatisfied tax liabilities. That is the general tenor of the letter which was presented on 24 September by the Taxation Commissioner. That is unexceptionable. I remind the House of the terms of the notice of motion which I gave. I referred to tax evasion practices and I also referred to tax avoidance. We must make this distinction immediately: Tax evasion is illegal, although not terribly sedulously pursued by this Government; tax avoidance is the abuse of the spirit of the tax laws by using defects or weaknesses in the law to avoid tax which morally is payable, is liable.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are certain practices which one would describe as blatant, contrived, artificial and beyond the bounds of reasonableness which, although legal, are tax avoidance and should be acted against. The terms 'blatant', 'contrived', ' artificial' and 'beyond the bounds of reasonableness' are terms that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has used in this Parliament in relation to what can be described as a dry Slutzkin scheme. A dry Slutzkin scheme, very simply, is an arrangement whereby the accumulated profits which are liable to tax in the hands of the recipients, once they are distributed, cease to be liable to tax when they are capitalised by virtue of a sale, through whatever process, to a promoter who is aiming at tax avoidance and/or evasion practices. It usually involves a result whereby the person, persons or organisation disposing of such a company with accumulated profits but not current profits, I declare, are associated with a sale price in excess of what could be reasonably expected as the maximum market price. All these things are associated with transactions related to the companies that I spoke about.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think we ought to get something on the record straight off: I do not know Mr Reid and I make no personal assessment of the man. But in relation to the matter of taxation his care and application, his punctiliousness in relation to his moral responsibility-I stress the words 'moral responsibility'-to pay tax according to the spirit of the law I think were summed up very nicely on 23 June 1978 in the Australian Financial Review. It stated:

       not only of lawyer and BHP director John Reid, stockbroker and Sydney Stock Exchange chairman Brian France and trade union official Mr B. J. Smith but came very close to the sentiments of Federal Treasurer John Howard.
      </para>
      <para>
       John Reid showed that, irrespective of rights and wrongs, stockbrokers, doctors and lawyers have been engulfed in an avalanche of criticism because they have all lost touch with the community.

       John Reid departed from his prepared address to suggest that the accountant's duty was to the person paying the bill and that it was the government's duty to remedy taxation ills and not to 'lumber' a branch of the community with the task , the reaction was predictable.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are several newspaper comments of that ilk. Simply what Mr Reid was saying is that if one pays the piper one should be able to command the tune one wants and to blazes with ethics or morality in this sort of matter.
      </para>
      <para>
       I go on to trace very quickly the historical movement of the companies that I will be referring to. They are: Printing Associates, Exeat, Ace Drive Yourself, Paravane, All Cars Drive Yourself and Kenny's Drive Yourself. These companies were disposed of on 28 June 1977 to a series of people whom I mentioned in the motion which I moved. On 9 June 1978 they were then disposed of to Lloyd Faint and Guide Securities, both named in the McCabe-Lafranchi report for their association with Mr Maher, and R. Southern. I understand that Mr Southern also has a close association with Mr Maher. On 23 June 1978 the companies went to Henry Kawalczuk, an unemployed labourer who is in the business of taking over expensive companies, Pocita Lisa Pty Ltd and David Rayner. The former two were mentioned in the McCabe-Lafranchi report. Thereafter, we have been able to establish that a number of the companies eventually went to the bottom of the harbour in the colloquialism-that is, all papers, records and returns suddenly disappeared. To establish that there is a consistent pattern I seek leave to table the documents related to those companies and the transactions which I have briefly outlined.

        —That in itself is interesting enough, but there is another aspect. There is an extraordinarily curious development in the process of all of this. These companies, I repeat, just before the end of the fiscal year, which is the usual practice adopted by Mr Brian Maher and people engaged in the sort of industry he is engaged in, were sold, eventually fitting into this Maher-type operation. But-this is important-only a few months earlier in February-March, at about the time of the Slutzkin decision by the High Court, all of those companies were the subject of a declaraton of solvency prior to winding up. The significance of that is very simply this: If they become insolvent, if there are solvency proceedings, the accumulated profits are distributed into the hands of certain recipients, whether companies or individuals, and are liable to taxation . That was the process in train. Suddenly, somewhere along the line, with a snap of the fingers the whole process was changed and this transaction was embarked upon which, by its result, guaranteed that that tax liability would not have to be met and that that which would otherwise have been regarded as and therefore treated by the Commissioner of Taxation as taxable income would become tax free as a capital gain. That is the nature of these transactions. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the table in relation to that matter and seek leave to table the documents in relation to it.

        —I move on to the next salient point, that is, the capitalisation process.

       What the financial statements show is simply this: The total value of the several companies at 30 June 1977 was $470,576. The price paid by Laro Traders- that is the Maher group- was $467,337. But there was a tax liability of $43,827 as a result of accumulated profits held within that company. I will put that in another way: The market value-the market price-after appropriate allowance was made for tax liability and for promoters fees in this was $423,510, to round off the figure; the sale price was $467,338. One would have to believe in Father Christmas walking around in the money markets of this country to accept that because what that means is that, as a result of the transactions, Laro Traders- Brian Maher's group-paid more for this block of companies than could have been reasonably expected to have been realised in the market-place if liabilities had been properly met. I seek leave to have that table incorporated in Hansard and to table the relevant documents on this matter.

        —I will not go into any more detail on the table because it speaks for itself. One cannot walk into the market-place and expect that there is going to be a mug around every minute who will pay more than the market would sensibly pay. Whatever one might think of Mr Brian Maher, he is not a mug when it comes to handling finances. He has made himself very wealthy at the expense of the taxpaying community. If honourable members are not too happy with that view, I will quote what the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) declared as a principle and a standard of ethics in relation to this matter. He spoke to the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures on 27 September, only a few days after I gave notice of my motion to the House. I would like to draw the attention of honourable members of the Government to this matter because it goes right to the heart of what I am saying about this matter. It may be that the Commissioner for Taxation can say there is no tax liability at law because there has been no tax evasion but, as a matter of morality, there is a moral responsibility to tax. That is exactly what the Prime Minister was saying in this speech and on a number of other occasions which I will quote from in a few seconds. The Prime Minister said:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I am told there are circumstances in which the vendor-shareholder did not know that the purchaser was going to pay tax and that therefore he did not know that the tax was not going to be paid. I might at times find it difficult that he did not know because of the test-
      </para>
      <para>
       There should be a 'sic' somewhere in parenthesis there; the Prime Minister must have written this speech. The Prime Minister continued:
      </para>
      <para>
       this is part of the test of the legislation, is that on the basis on the price he gets for the shares, which is of course a capital price, there is not enough money left in the company to pay the tax. If you add the fee of the promoter together with the price of the vendor-shareholders, there was generally nothing left and so how was the tax going to be paid. Obviously in many cases it was not .
      </para>
      <para>
       He is talking about bottom-of-the-harbour schemes; he is talking about wet Slutzkins. The principle in respect of what he was saying there applies equally to the dry Slutzkin cases that I have been talking about. The Prime Minister goes on to confirm the case I am making. He said:
      </para>
      <para>
       It is the law together with an ethical attitude of society to the people with whom one does business, that makes this country and if we have to legislate for every wrongful act that people might have in mind, then we will be so subsumed in legislation of every kind Sir Lawrence Street and every judge in the land will have to work overtime and never get a Sunday off because so much would have to go to the courts.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prime Minister is saying exactly what I am saying: One cannot credibly argue that, if someone gives more than one could reasonably and properly expect in the market-place, one will not ask questions and be suspicious that there is something crooked going on and if it relates to one's tax liability one would know what it is. Secondly, it does not just require a declaration of the law to establish that one is doing wrong. In the words of the Prime Minister there is a matter of ethical conduct about wrongful acts which go beyond the law and we cannot pass laws on every matter.
      </para>
      <para>
       So I have the Prime Minister completely endorsing the concern that I have raised on these matters. There we have it in a number of instances which I have mentioned to the House already. We have the historical movement of these companies down in most cases to the bottom of the harbour, as far as we can trace them. We have a process of liquidation suddenly and inexplicably halted in circumstances which resulted in the avoidance of tax liable being paid. We have financial statements which confirm this. We have financial statements which show that more was paid for the company than could have been realised reasonably in the market place.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is another puzzling aspect of all this. All six companies were owned by Shellbank Holdings. Shellbank was owned by Monty Holdings. Mr Reid was a director at all relevant times. From March 1982-bear this in mind as substantial circumstantial evidence which one must associate with all this-the media in this country were increasingly and more expansively reporting that the McCabe- Lafranchi report was going to be released and that it would foreshadow the stripping of hundreds and hundreds of companies. More than that, it was increasingly clear that it would be tabled in the Victorian Parliament by the incoming Labor Government. The Labor Government came in on 3 April. Curiously enough, according to documents in relation to Shellbank Holdings lodged at the Australian Capital Territory Companies office on 20 May 1982, a general meeting of Shellbank was called on 20 April. According to the documents lodged in the Australian Capital Territory Companies Office on that date the general meeting convened on 20 April 1982 authorised an increase in the company's share capital from $50,000 to $6m by the creation of 2,975,000 new shares. On 24 May 1982, three days before the McCabe-Lafranchi report was tabled in the Victorian Parliament, a declaration of solvency, which precedes liquidation of a company, was lodged. According to the document the liquidation commenced on 27 May 1982, the very day on which the McCabe-Lafranchi report was tabled. There is also a document which is the minutes of an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders on 26 May 1982 signed by Mr Reid-the said Mr Reid. Mr Speaker, I seek an extension of time.

But in all the circumstances as I unfold the evidence associated with this matter do not honourable members agree, if they are in a reasonable frame of mind, that there is more than a prima facie case to be investigated? Put the Commissioner of Taxation to one side. We are talking about tax avoidance as well as tax evasion whenever we debate these matters. I mentioned both in the notice of motion that I gave in this Parliament . I knew that my information was reliable, was sound. I am proving it step by step. It is substantial. In July this year Mr Lafranchi circulated to all governments, both conservative and non-conservative, a list giving details of over 2,000 companies which Mr Lafranchi said were part of the Maher group of companies he had investigated but which were outside Victorian jurisdiction. The list included the six companies of which Mr Reid was a director and which were sold on 28 June 1977.
      </para>
      <para>
       What are some of the defences which might be put up? Mr Reid, according to the record, has said that he is only a director. He has also claimed that he had a non-beneficial interest. It does not matter. At law a director has certain responsibilities to discharge. That is incontestable. Under section 229 (2) of the Companies Act he has to:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . at all times exercise a reasonable degree of care and diligence in the exercise of his powers and the discharge of his duties.
      </para>
      <para>
       It does not matter if as a company director he is in that position in a non- beneficial sense. He is party to the decisions which proceed among the board of directors and he is therefore at law responsible for them. It might be argued, as I have heard suggested, that these companies were revenue reserve companies. Of course they were. They were dormant companies. We have only to go back to the letter that the Prime Minister wrote in 1977-I will come back to it directly- through his principal private secretary, Mr Budd, to the Treasurer in which he outlined these sorts of companies-dormant companies, accumulated profit companies-which were being used to dividend strip to avoid tax liability. The Government is on record, a voluminous record, declaring its objection to these companies. I must say that action has not supported the declaration of concern.
      </para>
      <para>
       It might be said that there were some intermediaries between the Brian Maher operation and the disposal of these companies by the people with whom Mr Reid was associated. Let us explore that proposition. It is rather curious that a few of the people to whom these companies were disposed of in the first instance remained company directors for less than a day. Some of their names are identifiable in ways which are quite interesting in relation to these sorts of practices. I get back to one simple fact: It does not matter who has been put between the Maher operation and the companies with which Mr Reid has been associated. In one or two instances, or several, or all of them, as the Prime Minister has said, one cannot sensibly or cogently argue that there should not have been any questions asked, especially if one is an experienced company director as is Mr Reid, according to his record, when one is paid more than a market would sensibly pay for these companies.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has been calmly accommodating dry Slutzkin operations and has been doing so for a very long time. In that respect the Government must shoulder the major share of the blame for the fact that these practices flourish so extensively and expensively in the community. On 12 July 1977 the Prime Minister was alarmed enough about dry Slutzkin operations, tax avoidance operations costing many millions of dollars to taxpayers in the community, that he wrote a letter to the Treasurer in which he outlined the practices which were used in these respects. That letter is in that large folio of documentation released by the Treasurer which damns the Treasurer and the Government and upholds the propriety and efficiency of the Australian Taxation Office. But the interesting thing is that right up until 1981 there was no effective action by the Government to stop dry Slutzkin operations. In 1978 legislation was passed and within a few days Mr O'Reilly, the Commissioner of Taxation, was writing to the Treasurer declaring that the dry Slutzkins were going on as ever; advertisements were proliferating in the newspapers in spite of the legislation. It was, in a nutshell, ineffective. It was on the part of the market a Bronx cheer, a crude raspberry to the Government as to what is was about. It was also evidence of how faint hearted the Government is in these matters. If anyone, however, tries to derogate in any way at all the significance of tax avoidance practices where dividend stripping is involved, let me remind him of what the Treasurer said in this Parliament on 7 April 1978. He said:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . it is particularly unfair when, in many cases, the persons involved in these schemes are the ones best able financially to accept their tax liabilities .
      </para>
      <para>
       He went on:
      </para>
      <para>
       It has long been recognised that it is reasonable for taxpayers to so organise their affairs as to minimise liability for taxation. However, the Government believes that some techniques of tax avoidance are so blatant, contrived and artificial as to go beyond the bounds of reasonableness.
      </para>
      <para>
       I agree with that view. A dry Slutzkin operation comes within the definition that the Treasurer has given in this matter. In those circumstances my concern is that these matters ought to be investigated. I produce only the evidence. The conclusions seem quite overwhelming at this point. I produce the evidence and I say: On the basis of that evidence, on the basis of the principles declared by the Government and the concern it has enunciated many times firmly, and frequently fiercely, this matter must be investigated thoroughly and put beyond any doubt. The inquiry carried out by the Taxation Commissioner does not fulfil that requirement. The McCabe-Lafranchi report referred to numerous instances of tax evasion and avoidance associated with Brian Maher. The Treasurer said that over half of them were dry Slutzkin-type operations. If that is so the enormity of what we are considering looms very large because Mr Reid has been appointed by the Government to and continues to serve on a number of public authority bodies. That is why I believe, if the Government stands by the principle it has enunciated, these matters should be properly investigated. Costigan, in his fourth report, on pages 71 and 72, under the heading 'Misfeasance' said in relation to dry Slutzkins:
      </para>
      <para>
       The target company was, as is frequently the case, a trading company conducting a legitimate business.
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . the following steps were taken to allow that to occur:
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) the assets and liabilities of the target company were then transferred to the new corporate entity, leaving, at the end of the day, a target company with only cash in the bank. The amount of cash in the bank was equal to the accumulated profits, plus the current year profits (if any).
      </para>
      <para>
       I stress the words 'if any'. So Costigan was talking about dry Slutzkins as much as wet Slutzkins when he was talking about bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. Costigan continues:
      </para>
      <para>
       The cash in the bank reflected that question, and it was on that amount that the percentage constituting the promoter's commission was calculated.
      </para>
      <para>
       At a Liberal Party breakfast in Brisbane a few weeks ago the Prime Minister said this, with which I wholeheartedly agree:
      </para>
      <para>
       If you have got something that is worth $1,000 and somebody comes along and says I can pay you $1,300 for that, aren't you going to wonder whether something is a bit odd? You might just say well it is your good furtune, but I would have thought most people would ask some questions.
      </para>
      <para>
       So would I, and I am asking them. I am asking the Prime Minister to ask them. I am asking the Government to stand by the declarations it has made in this matter . It may well be that there is a reasonable explanation in this matter but that has yet to be established. It has to be established on the balance of the facts which are presented by a proper, thorough public investigation into this matter.

        —The Leader of the Opposition has shown that he cannot accept the letter of the Commissioner of Taxation in which he makes it perfectly plain that there was no tax liability, and no tax liability under the recoupment legislation currently before this Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition issued a statement saying that he was thoroughly dissatisfied with the letter on the day, or the day after, it was published. He sought to introduce other and different issues. He sought to confuse this House with his wet Slutzkins and dry Slutzkins. Let me try to explain why there is a very substantial difference between these practices. Bottom-of-the-harbour taxation schemes involve companies with current tax liabilities, which remained unpaid and which remain unpaid to this day, and which will be collected when the current legislation which is before the Parliament is passed by the Parliament. In addition, bottom- of-the-harbour schemes are fraudulent in nature on the part of at least one person taking part in the operations. In relation to the so-called dry Slutzkin schemes which the Leader of the Opposition has spoken about today, company tax was paid and no tax liability remains. The High Court of Australia in a judgment has quite specifically approved the dry Slutzkin schemes.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Quite plainly, the Leader of the Opposition is trying to introduce into this Parliament a quite impossible proposition; namely, that any person who had at any time participated in any tax minimisation proposal which was subsequently outlawed by this Parliament and by legislation passed through this Parliament, or which was caught by section 4A of the general anti-avoidance provisions, would, therefore, not be a fit and proper person to hold public office. I suggest that that is an impossible proposition because practices change. This Government, and only this Government, has legislated time and again to outlaw improper taxation practices. If the Leader of the Opposition proposes to legislate at some point retrospectively or believes there ought to be retrospective legislation to collect alleged back tax in relation to all those schemes which have since been outlawed, obviously that is a total and absolute impossibility.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Leader of the Opposition ought to be pressed to define what he means when he says that the Government's legislation does not go far enough, that he wants it to go further, and that he would collect additional sums from other tax minimisation proposals which have since been outlawed. The dry Slutzkin scheme was one in which company tax had been paid and no liability remained. The High Court has upheld that such schemes are in fact lawful. The Leader of the Opposition sought to impute in his motion that Mr John Reid had been involved in bottom-of-the-harbour operations; that was the clear implication. It was just as clear as the implication that he made when he wanted certain names to be put together as a result of comments he made in relation to the Costigan Royal Commission report on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. There is only one reason that Mr Reid's name has been used in this Parliament. There is only one reason that this smear has been introduced into the Parliament. It is because Mr John Reid agreed to serve on a review in relation to the Commonwealth Public Service.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is worth noting the response to the charge which was made in the Parliament. Mr Reid immediately stood aside. He wrote to the Commissioner of Taxation giving authority for full information to be made available. He strongly denied the imputation that had been made under cover of the Parliament as an unfair and unfounded attack which was bitterly resented. Indeed, it was unfair and is unfounded. Mr O'Reilly's reply was very clear. He said that there were no unsatisfied income tax liabilities, there was no bottom-of-the-harbour operation and the company would not be caught by the recoupment legislation. There was a total clearance with respect to existing and new legislation.

        —Since Mr O'Reilly's letter became public, the Leader of the Opposition has continued to make allegations. He has continued to do so outside and inside the Parliament. He has continued to try to establish guilt by association. The important point for this Parliament to note is the state the company was in when it was sold. If all tax liabilities had been paid when the company was sold how could anyone try to impute guilt on a person on the basis of the nature of the purchaser of the company? Do the Leader of the Opposition or the members of the Labor Party look to the character of anyone if that person is selling a house or selling a mob of sheep at an auction? It is the state that the article is in when it is sold that counts. In this case the companies in which Mr John Reid was involved were in proper order. In addition to that, Mr John Reid had no beneficial interest in the companies. He, with two other people who were nowhere mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition, were appointed as trustees to Mr McIllree in January or February of, I think, 1973-six or seven months before Mr McIllree died of cancer but after he knew that he was going to die of cancer.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       There were other trustees. There were other directors. Why is Mr Reid singled out? Is it only because he has been given a job by this Government? Is it only because he is working for this Government? The documents that have been tabled by the Leader of the Opposition indicate the names of the other directors, the names of other persons involved. Honourable members may be interested to look to those names to see what positions those people hold, what offices they are in, what positions they have been given by other governments of other political complexions. One of them at least is in a position now of some significance. If there is any guilt-which we very strongly deny-in relation to Mr Reid, there is guilt also in relation to other trustees. But there is no guilt in relation to any of them. The singling out of one name in relation to this matter emphasises the nature of the smear and what the Leader of the Opposition seems to be best at.

        —I am asked: Who are they? But I am not going to use this Parliament in the way that the Leader of the Opposition has used this Parliament . The Leader of the Opposition by tabling documents has published the names of the other trustees. Honourable members sitting behind the Leader of the Opposition will be more than a little interested to know the particular offices that one of those trustees has and continues to have at this stage in a certain State. He also signed the sale documents. His name appears in the documents. It, admittedly, does not appear in the summaries that had been prepared for the convenience of the media and of the Parliament, I suppose, but it does appear in the background documents. It does appear in sale documents. He was part of the company organisation, part of the company management. The Leader of the Opposition, if he wants to smear, should smear the whole class and not just one person out of the class.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       This is what the Leader of the Opposition is, of course, best at. It is the work that he enjoys most. It is the work that he seems best capable of. There are many examples of the Leader of the Opposition's smearing. We remember what he said about Nugan Hand Ltd. Earlier this year, he said in this House:
      </para>
      <para>
       That this House-
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) views with the greatest alarm public allegations today that a senior Minister of the Government has been responsible for preventing any action being proceeded with against Nugan Hand . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       He also said:
      </para>
      <para>
       I also understand that the affidavit will declare that the Deputy Prime Minister is the Minister concerned.
      </para>
      <para>
       Later on, the Leader of the Opposition had to admit that the allegations were totally without foundation. He was asked this question on television:
      </para>
      <para>
       Do you still believe that a senior Minister may have been involved in that cover-up?
      </para>
      <para>
       He said:
      </para>
      <para>
       I have never had any evidence of that.
      </para>
      <para>
       There was no affidavit. That was a smear by the Leader of the Opposition.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Leader of the Opposition smeared the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) before reading the Finnane report. Within an hour of the report being tabled in the New South Wales Parliament he said in this Parliament :
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, I have not read a 700 page report.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, he could not wait to accuse the right honourable member of what the Leader of the Opposition said, on the findings of that report tabled in the New South Wales Parliament that day, but which the Leader of the Opposition had not read, could only be described, apparently, as a succession of swindles. Of course, the right honourable member for New England stood down. He was charged. All charges fraudulently put against him by the New South Wales Attorney-General and the Corporate Affairs Commissioner of New South Wales were struck out. That was a politically motivated prosecution, probably motivated by the same people who gave the initial information to the Leader of the Opposition in relation to Mr John Reid. The only problem is that they did not tell him that in trying to capture John Reid they were also going to be capturing one of their own.
      </para>
      <para>
       We can look at the confidential documents in relation to Mr Costigan. Mr Costigan has said on more than one occasion that even though he was pressed to allow us to publish the documents those two confidential documents should not be published.
      </para>
      <para>
       I believe that the Leader of the Opposition wanted certain people to put two names together as a result of certain things that were said and certain implications that were drawn about categories of people mentioned in those reports. Somebody was foolish enough and stupid enough to do just that. But it was the Leader of the Opposition who turned the key that opened the door.

        —The Leader of the Opposition might think it is a funny matter because he does think that smearing is humorous. But there are one or two people sitting behind him right at this moment, if he looks at them, who do not regard the matter as quite so funny because, as the Leader of the Opposition knows, it was a deliberate act. In addition to that, in spite of the fact that Mr Costigan has said it would be inaccurate to draw any specific conclusions from those reports as to who is or is not involved and in spite of the fact that other people who have read those reports have said quite plainly that one cannot draw any implications about relationships with people from any political party, the Leader of the Opposition continues to do so and did so as recently as three or four days ago in Brisbane when speaking on a television channel. He was smearing again. In relation to that matter the Leader of the Opposition said:

       He said that on Channel 9 on 1 October. He added:

       . . . but really I think we, are just about on the border or slightly over what I can talk about.
      </para>
      <para>
       He said 'slightly over'. He was so far over the border of what he could talk about that he obviously cannot be trusted with confidential reports of that kind . What did this great, gentle advocate of justice say when one of our colleagues in this Parliament suffered from a heart attack? There was no sense of decency or comradeship. He said:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . the product of worry, some might say conscience.
      </para>
      <para>
       That must be about the worst, most despicable and most contemptible thing any person has ever said in the Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition thinks it is a humorous and funny matter. He thinks it is humorous and funny but now he cannot take it. He just dishes it out and he does not like it when he gets his own medicine back.

        —The attack on Mr John Reid was just as disgraceful, especially its continuation after the Taxation Commissioner's full and total clearance in relation to any tax liability for those companies. As there were no tax liabilities for those companies when they were sold it does not matter to whom they were sold any more than it matters in relation to the selling of a mob of sheep, herd of cattle, a house, a holiday home or any other article. The companies were sold in good order. That was the responsibility of Mr Reid and his co-trustees. There was an implied attack on the Taxation Commissioner. ( Extension of time granted). The Leader of the Opposition has made it plain that his attack is not only on Mr Reid but also on the Taxation Commissioner. The clear implication of what he has said is that that letter is inadequate, that the examination was too quick and that the letter was not a proper letter for him to write. I suggest that if the honourable gentleman wants any further confirmation of that he should read the Senate Estimates Committee Hansard of last night in which Mr O'Reilly was questioned-as I am advised-in detail on that matter.

      <para>
       The Leader of the Opposition is a past master at smearing in this Parliament. Is that because he is trying to be tough or is it just that he is mean and nasty himself? He admits, as he did recently, that he uses the Parliament for theatrical dramatics. I should have thought that it would be of more use to use this Parliament to discuss matters of concern to the people of Australia. But if it is a matter of theatrical dramatics-to use his own term-he is a fourth rate actor and a fourth rate politician who will always be unacceptable to the public . More and more people now are saying very plainly that a few weeks ago the Labor Party made the wrong choice. Is the Leader of the Opposition really trying to strengthen his position in the Labor Party? Does he really think that he will attract people who supported Mr Hawke by this kind of tactic? He repels the Labor Party, he repels Australia and, having thrown dirt, he seeks to rub his hands in it. The Leader of the Opposition fails to understand that that letter from Mr O'Reilly, coupled with the other letters which I have tabled in relation to Shellbank Holdings Pty Ltd, because nothing had been said about that before, indicate quite plainly that Mr John Reid discharged his duties to the Australian Taxation Office and the Tax Commissioner and there the matter should rest.

        —The Prime Minister has been cornered and he is now digging in behind tax dodgers and tax dodging. That is very much more characteristic for the Prime Minister who has always been partial to a tax dodge, it being his Government which has introduced more tax rorts of one kind or another mainly to seek to advance its own favoured friends. Many of the particular tax rorts which have been introduced have ended up blowing up in his face. It has subsequently had to fix them up as their manifest inadequacies have been revealed. But what the Prime Minister is in fact seeking to do, and the only thing which he did do in the 20 minutes which was available to him, was to say that there is rarely some tax dodging which is okay and other forms of tax dodging which are not okay. What we want to know from the Prime Minister is simply this: The Leader of the Opposition has indicated he has tabled papers which indicate Mr Reid was associated with certain companies. The Leader of the Opposition has indicated, and I will again, that those companies were organised in such a way, or appear to have been organised in such a way, as to bestow certain tax advantages on either the companies, the shareholders or the people the directors are representing. What we want to know from the Prime Minister is: Were any of those six companies, of which Mr Reid was the director, involved in any kind of tax dodging against which this Government has already acted? Were those companies involved in any schemes which this Government has now outlawed? Is he prepared to answer that question? If he does answer it and if the answer is in the affirmative he seems to be saying that certain schemes, such as the dry Slutzkin scheme, are okay as long as they were carried out prior to the time the Government legislated. That is not what the Government has been ranting and raving about. It is certainly not what the Prime Minister has been ranting and raving about in recent times. I refer the Prime Minister to the 1 October edition of the Sydney Morning Herald in which he is quoted as saying:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       But are we governed only by law? Is there not a question of ethics? Is there not a question of honour in the way in which people do their business? If every wrongful act has to be proscribed by law, then we're really going to be so circumscribed by laws, that you'll need a couple of solicitors behind you at every step and I don't particularly want to live in that kind of society.
      </para>
      <para>
       In this instance the Prime Minister is not simply talking about what is strictly within the law at a particular time; he is talking about what is ethical and what is moral. Let us take this debate back to the circumstances in which it arose. The Prime Minister, in order to distract attention from the very glaring criticism of the Government in relation to its procrastination on tax dodging, said he was setting up an inquiry into the Public Service, as if the Public Service had something to do with the Government's procrastination when it was quite clear that the Commisisoner of Taxation had increasingly been going spare about the fact that the Government would not act on any of his advice in relation to tax avoidance schemes. On that occasion the Prime Minister said:
      </para>
      <para>
       The third challenge, I regret to say, arises from a deterioration in what I might call the 'business ethics' of a minority. There was a time when the administration, in its relationships with business, could assume that a high degree of trust was appropriate. The Service did not have to be geared to handle cheating on a large scale . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       He then referred to the Service's inability to respond speedily and adequately to the challenges posed by those who seek to behave unethically or even illegally. He said:
      </para>
      <para>
       Those in the community who cheat on their obligations to others or attempt dishonestly to evade the law, whether by evading taxation . . . not only bring dishonour to themselves but also impose real strains on the Public Service . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prime Minister wants to set up an inquiry which can ensure that the Public Service, as a result, can be in better shape to deal with these tax cheats. Therefore, I would have thought that it was beyond argument that the people involved in that inquiry, particularly the person who was to lead it, should be entirely above reproach on any of those matters.
      </para>
      <para>
       We are not talking about some strict definition of law breaking. The Prime Minister has not sought to use that on other occasions. We are talking about morality, business ethics and cheating. What has the Prime Minister been saying about some of those things? He went to Kingston recently. I am sure that he will not be invited back by the current honourable member for Kingston (Mr Chapman). He certainly will not be around when the next member for Kingston is in this House. What the Prime Minister said to the rapt audience of businessmen at Kingston was that he was talking about people who were trying to get rid of companies that had a tax liability to the Commonwealth to the benefit of the shareholders. There is no question about there being some strict distinction between company tax and money in the hands of the shareholders which would otherwise have been destined for the Federal Treasury. He was talking about schemes which avoid the tax liability of companies to the benefit of shareholders. He said:
      </para>
      <para>
       In a real sense, the recipients of those funds have in their hands stolen funds , whether you want to say stolen from the Commonwealth or stolen from other taxpayers . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       He was not saying that only the money that has been ripped off the Treasury in relation to company taxes is stolen money; he was talking about all of it as being stolen money and those people who have it as being the recipients of stolen money. He continued:
      </para>
      <para>
       In relation to tax avoidance, I have said on other occasions and other places that people who pursue and generally people of wealth who pursue practices which only result in the cheating of the Commonwealth or the cheating of the generality of the Australian public in a highly sophisticated way in which wealthy people often become wealthier, is something totally unAustralian--
      </para>
      <para>
       In recent times we have seen the Prime Minister in great form thundering denunciation of tax avoidance of any kind. Now he is seeking to justify that certain activities and certain kinds of theft which are involved in denying the Treasury money which was due to it are okay as far as he is concerned. That is not the view of the Treasurer (Mr Howard). It will be remembered that these six companies had already embarked on the process of liquidation. If that liquidation had pursued its full course the shareholders who received the distributed assets of those companies would have been taxed, in their own hands, that part of the distributed assets of the company which represented profits from former years. That is the process on which these companies have embarked-to liquidate and to distribute their assets, and then the shareholders would have been liable for tax in their own hands.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mysteriously, in February of 1977, that course of action was changed. It was perhaps changed for the reason that in February 1977 the Barwick High Court, which has accurately been described at that time as the tax avoiders temple, had given a decision in relation to the Slutzkin case. What the High Court had said was that to engage in certain artificial practices in order to avoid tax was okay. At the same time as that judgment was brought down these six companies altered their course and pursued an entirely different course which resulted in shareholders avoiding a substantial part of the tax liability which they would have incurred had those companies been liquidated in the normal way. In 1978 the Treasurer clamped down on some of these aspects which had been revealed by the Slutzkin scheme and particularly by the High Court decision of the time. At that time the Treasurer said of these schemes which we are now talking about:
      </para>
      <para>
       However the Government believes that some techniques of tax avoidance--
      </para>
      <para>
       Tax avoidance not tax evasion-
      </para>
      <para>
       are so blatant and contrived and artificial as to go beyond the bounds of reasonableness.
      </para>
      <para>
       What the Treasurer was talking about, and he was absolutely right at the time, was that any scheme which involved the artificial avoidance of a tax liability was unacceptable to the Government. Regrettably it took the Government until 1981 to move on the particular aspect of these schemes which allowed shareholders to receive the benefits of those companies and not pay tax on them. The Government cannot have it both ways. The Prime Minister cannot continue to claim that this Government has an unparalleled record in relation to clamping down on tax avoidance schemes and at the same time say that the people who were involved in the schemes were really not doing anything wrong.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government simply cannot have it both ways. We have identified and had tabled in this Parliament details of 22 schemes which this Government has outlawed during the last few years. Those 22 schemes are in the blatantly artificial and contrived category of which the Treasurer was so critical in 1978 . This is the kind of scheme in which Mr Reid was involved. I have indicated that had the process of liquidation continued the shareholders would have been liable for tax. Apparently as a result of resorting to different procedures in relation to getting rid of these companies the amount of tax which was saved in 1977 dollars was over $43,000, which in current day terms is $76,000. We are not suggesting that Reid is in Horgan's category. We are not suggesting that Reid is the worst tax dodger in the country. What we are saying is that, quite clearly, the companies with which Mr Reid was associated were involved in avoiding tax to the tune of $43,000 for their shareholders at the time. He is not on that evidence a fit person to lead this inquiry.

        —There are two aspects of this motion that I would like to canvass. Firstly, there is the central issue; and it was only in the dying moments of his remarks that the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) decided that he would make the claim that Mr Reid was not a fit person to hold certain offices. His leader was a little shy about making that claim. All that his leader was prepared to do was to say that these matters required some further investigation. But the bold man from the west was prepared to go a little further and to say that he was not a fit and proper person to hold these offices. Before I move to that, I would like to canvass another matter which is relevant to this issue. We have now spent something like an hour debating some allegations about the fitness of a person to serve on a public body. It is but the latest example of the way in which over the past two months the privilege of this Parliament, the privilege of the New South Wales Parliament and, dare I say , the privilege of other parliaments have been used and abused to smear and denigrate the reputations of people around the country.

        —In case in their contrived, blatant and artificial anger honourable members opposite believe that I am being selective in what I am saying about the abuse of parliamentary privilege, I remind them that, when the friend of the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), the honourable member for Cronulla in the New South Wales Parliament, Mr Egan, made his ill-fated attack in the New South Wales Parliament, I said that it gave me no pleasure that once again the parliamentary privilege of an institution in this country was being used to denigrate, perhaps in an unsubstantiated way, the reputations of people. There was a time when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) even argued that a partnership between a husband and a wife for a corner store represented a form of tax avoidance. He said that during the 1977 election campaign. Whatever our views about the relative blameworthiness of different tax minimisation and tax avoidance arrangements, that gives but one illustration of how very subjective and very varied judgments on this issue can be.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       In respect of Mr Reid, in many of the comments made in another place and here about Mr Horgan and in the remarks made by Mr Egan in the New South Wales Parliament, we have witnessed one of the worst abuses of parliamentary privilege that we have seen in this country for many years. The result of that has been twofold. First, it has really diverted us from a rational debate upon our taxation system and the right way of going about stamping out tax avoidance and evasion in this country. It has converted the debate into a slanging match about personalities and it has diverted the debate entirely from a proper examinaton of the issues. So I say firstly to the Leader of the Opposition and to the honourable member for Fremantle, confused though they may be as to precisely what they think about Mr Reid, that I believe today is yet another example of the extent to which parliamentary privilege has been abused in this debate. Are we to have introduced into the House a motion saying that somebody publicly known 10 years ago took a cash payment for laying a carpet and that, therefore, that person ought to be thrown off some body that he is on? There will be no end to this kind of process unless we get a far more rational approach to it. If, person by person, individual by individual, that kind of approach is adopted, I suggest that the time of this Parliament between now and the bicentenary will be spent in debating those kinds of issues.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let me move to the second point. It is really the core of this argument. When the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) gave notice of his motion in the dying hours of the last sitting of the Parliament, the purpose of that motion-let us be honest about it; I am sure that he will be honest about it-was to create the impression that John Reid was a tax evader. That was the purpose. It was not some kind of innocent--

That was the impression. It was not a gentle searching from the heart inquiry as to facts; it was a deliberate attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to create that impression. I think he failed to do that and I think the most effective demonstration of that failure is for me to quote from the letter of the Commissioner of Taxation. It is worth repetition.

        —He does not like it. The Commissioner of Taxation, in his letter of 24 September, said:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I am able to advise you that the six companies have no unsatisfied income tax liabilities in relation to the period up to the time at which you ceased to have any connection with them . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       I repeat that the Commissioner said:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . no unsatisfied income tax liabilities . . . . up to the time at which you ceased to have any connection with them . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       He continued:
      </para>
      <para>
       and it follows from that you will have no responsibilities under the special recoupment tax legislation introduced into the Parliament last night.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commissioner then went on to say:
      </para>
      <para>
       There are no unsatisfied income tax liabilities in relation to the sale of the shares in the companies.
      </para>
      <para>
       I will repeat that:
      </para>
      <para>
       There are no unsatisfied income tax liabilities in relation to the sale of the shares in the companies.
      </para>
      <para>
       In both respects there is a very critical difference between what exists in relation to those companies and what exists in relation to the schemes and arrangements that are struck at by our special legislation. The Commissioner then went on to say:
      </para>
      <para>
       As requested in your letter, I have also checked your personal situation. I am able to state the information available to me shows that you have discharged all your responsibilities in respect of your own taxation affairs.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is the testimony about the taxation record of a person whom the Leader of the Opposition, whatever he may say today, sought by implication to paint as a tax evader when he brought that motion before the House. I say what I said at the outset of my speech: We have witnessed over the past few weeks-of which this is but one of a number of examples-an extreme abuse of parliamentary privilege by the Australian Labor Party in this place and by the Labor Party in the New South Wales Parliament. As a consequence and as a result parliamentary time has been wasted. The Commissioner of Taxation's letter regarding Mr Reid is very clear and unambiguous. I and the Government believe that that ought to be the end of the matter. We believe that the Leader of the Opposition stands condemned for having introduced this motion to the Parliament. I move:
      </para>
      <para>
       That the question be now put.
      </para>
      <para>
       Question resolved in the affirmative.
      </para>
      <para>
       Question put:
      </para>
      <para>
       That the motion (Mr Hayden's) be agreed to.

      <para>
       (a) The Program has been in existence in the former Department of Employment and Youth Affairs since April, 1980.
      </para>
      <para>
       The former Department of Industrial Relations including the Offices of the Industrial Registrar, was relatively small with approximately 460 employees located in all States, NT and ACT. The Department was created in December 1978 and assumed responsibility for its own management functions in July 1979. Since that time it has supported equal employment opportunity principles for all Departmental staff.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The aim of the program is to ensure that the most suitable person occupies each position within the organisation and that each individual within the organisation has equality of opportunity in his or her employment.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The program has met the stated aims. With the creation of the new Department of Employment and Industrial Relations a new program is now being developed which will further encourage full participation in Departmental operations and activities.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) The aims of the program were met by first identifying those categories of staff who may have been disadvantaged in their employment opportunities and then by raising awareness to the requirement to ensure that there is equal employment opportunity.
      </para>
      <para>
       (e) The program is aimed primarily at Central Office staff and through them the Regional Staff and the Commonwealth Employment Service.

      <para>
       (1) Did he inform the House on 20 February 1979 that it was his intention to introduce an 'early warning system' designed to indicate to the Insurance Commissioner in advance the possibility that an insurance company might default in meeting policy holder's claims; if so, can he provide details of the proposed legislation, its effect and proposed date of introduction.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the Business Review Weekly for March 6-12, 1982 warning policy holders that they should check their insurance companies because of the high probability of a number of liquidations in the general insurance area; if so, have (a) increased costs and (b) decline of investment income of insurers, increased the possibility that insurers may be unable to meet claims of policy holders.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Is it the attitude of the Government that policy holders should have access to the greatest possible range of information to enable them to be informed as to which insurers are able to meet claims; if so, does he intend to introduce amending legislation to ensure that the Insurance Commissioner and the Life Insurance Commissioner are given powers to publish full information required by statute to be provided by insurers; if not, why not.

       (4) Does he intend, as a result of the recommendations of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry, to sponsor consequential amendments to the provisions covering life assurance and, in particular, to strengthen the provisions of this legislation relating to solvency and the permitted investment of life insurers to ensure that such insurers will be, and will be known to be, in a position to meet claims; if not, why not.
      </para>

       (5) Is there a real and clearly perceived danger that both general and life insurers may be unable to meet claims from premium and investment income; if so what (a) steps does he intend to take to overcome this gap and (b) consideration has been given to (i) the present need for increased powers of the Insurance Commissioners over the permitted investment of life and general insurers and (ii ) strengthening requirements of existing legislation to provide more information relating to the solvency of insurers.

       <para in-line="1">
        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) I assume that the honourable member is referring to the answer which I provided on 20 February 1979 in response to the twelfth part of a previous question by the honourable member. In that answer I indicated that the Insurance Commissioner was introducing new procedural arrangements which would provide an Early Warning System somewhat similar to that used in North America but substantially adjusted to suit Australian requirements. The Insurance Commissioner reported on the implementation of the system on page 9 of his Fifth Annual Report, that is, for the year ended 30 June 1979. The introduction of the system was not dependent upon any legislative changes; however, improvements to the system have been sought by the Commissioner and provisions of relevance to this matter are contained in Clause 23 of the Insurance Amendment Bill 1982 which was introduced into the House of Representatives on 29 April 1982.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) I am aware of an article on the insurance industry contained in the Business Review Weekly for March 6-12, 1982. The ability of an insurer to meet claims can be dependent upon other factors besides those mentioned by the honourable member. Other important considerations include the level of paid-up capital and reserves held by the insurer, its reinsurance arrangements, and the overall quality of management of the insurer.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Government recognises the importance to policy owners of adequate access to financial information in assessing and comparing the financial strength of insurers. In this respect it is, of course, open to those insured to seek information from companies additional to that available from published sources. In considering statutory requirements for the disclosure of information , there are other considerations to be taken into account, including the need to maintain an appropriate degree of commercial confidentiality (an aspect recognised in the secrecy provisions to be found in both Acts), the costs associated with such disclosure and the intelligibility of such information to the general public. In this context many of the existing forms for collecting information from insurers under the Acts were not designed for public disclosure . However, while some amendments to the Life Insurance Act 1945 effected last year (see Schedule 1 of the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1981) and the amendments in Clause 37 of the Bill referred to in (1) above have some relevance to this matter, the Government will be giving consideration to the issues in this area as part of the process of assessment of the Report of the Campbell Committee. In this context I have in mind particularly certain relevant conclusions in Chapter 20 of the Report.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The Government will be giving careful consideration to the conclusions and recommendations of the Campbell Committee including those of particular relevance to both life and general insurance industries. In respect of the latter, the honourable member's attention is drawn to those provisions in the Bill referred to in (1) above concerned with increasing the solvency requirements reflected in the Insurance Act 1973.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) See (2), (3) and (4) above.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) See (3) above.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) and (8) The Insurance Commissioner and the Life Insurance Commissioner are, respectively, in continuing contact with authorised general insurance companies and registered life insurance companies. The purposes for which contact is made are numerous and varied and relate to the entire range of their respective responsibilities for the administration of the Insurance Act 1973 and the Life Insurance Act 1945. Consequently, it is not possible to provide information of this kind.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) and (10) The information that can appropriately be made available in this area is limited in view of the potential harm that could be done to a company and, in turn, to its policyholders. In this regard, the secrecy provisions of the Insurance Act 1973 and the Life Insurance Act 1945 are relevant. It might be mentioned, however, that, where inspections of general insurers have led to the issue of directions by the Treasurer under paragraphs 62 (1) (a), (b), (c) or (d ) of the Insurance Act, details are published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette and related information is published in the Insurance Commissioner's Annual Reports. Equally, it is not appropriate to make a prediction whether appointments of inspectors will be made within the next 6 months. These appointments are dependent upon many future contingencies and are subject to provisions in the Insurance Act and Life Insurance Act under which a company is entitled to an opportunity to show cause why an inspector should not be appointed.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) and (12) In my answer of 1 May 1979 to a question asked by the honourable member, I referred to the normal process of monitoring and review of domestic and overseas insurance legislation. This function is a continuing one and involves a wide range of material received concerning developments in various countries including the United Kingdom. Relevant developments in the various States of Australia are also monitored. Certain conclusions in the Report of the Campbell Committee are relevant to the United Kingdom Policy Holders Protection Act; in particular, it might be noted that the Committee came to the conclusion that there is no need for government involvement in any arrangements along the lines of those provided for in this Act. This conclusion will, of course, receive consideration by the Government along with any relevant recommendations which the Law Reform Commission might put forward as a result of its inquiries into the law of insurance contracts. I understand the Commission's Report is expected to be available within the next few months.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (a) All supervisors and operators of screen based equipment are being individually provided with copies of Public Service Board Memorandum 81/418. New operators will be provided with a copy as part of their induction process.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) (i) and (ii) There are four categories of staff who use screen based terminal equipment within my Department and statutory authorities.
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) Word Processing Operators
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) Operators of data processing equipment in State Offices
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) Computer Programmers preparing program suites
      </para>
      <para>
       (iv) Clerical and Librarian staff.
      </para>
      <para>
       The first three categories use screen based equipment extensively during the working day. In State offices operators of data processing equipment may also perform word processing in addition to the capture of data from student assistance application forms. The work load of these staff exhibits a high peak during February through to May, but is significantly less at other times of the year and consequently some of these officers may be transferred to other clerical tasks during that part of the year.
      </para>
      <para>
       While it is difficult to generalise, it is expected that operators falling in category (i) will spend 90 per cent of their working day operating screen based equipment, with the remainder of the time spent in preparing work for processing and checking printouts of completed work. In practice most operators do conform to the expected work pattern. However they are encouraged to take rest breaks as they feel these are necessary in order to avoid fatigue.
      </para>
      <para>
       Officers falling in category (ii) will usually spend 75 per cent of their working day operating screen based equipment and the remainder of the day on related clerical tasks. In most State offices a deliberate policy of rotating those staff to other duties is practised.
      </para>
      <para>
       Staff falling in category (iii) may also spend 90 per cent of their working day operating screen based equipment, but their use of such equipment is less regular than that of officers falling in categories (i) and (ii). Staff in this category spend their working day in preparing programs, diagnosing program faults, and in system testing. This involves desk work as well as the use of terminals. As the nature of the work varies throughout the system development and maintenance cycle it is not possible to be specific with respect to the daily or weekly pattern of terminal usage. Officers falling within category (iv) use screen based equipment on a casual or ad hoc basis for enquiries or report generation in support of their normal duties.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) (i) and (ii) In the word processing areas operators are expected to perform at keystroke rates laid down by the Public Service Board for typist classifications. Statistics have been kept in the Central Office of the Department since January 1982 with relation to the number of pages produced per operator per hour. Actual key strokes per hour are not calculated, nor are operators continually assessed on the basis of their keystroke rate. The nature of a word processing operators task within the Department is such that an assessment based purely upon a keystroke rate would be an invalid indicator of work performance.
      </para>
      <para>
       In State offices, figures are kept on the number of student assistance applications processed by operators, but keystroke rates are not determined, nor are the operators continually assessed on this basis.
      </para>
      <para>
       No figures are available on the keystroke rates of staff engaged in programming duties or those staff who use the equipment on a casual basis.

      <para>
       (4) There has been no mandatory action by the Security Council to restrict trade with South Africa, and the decisions of the General Assembly have only recommendatory force. In these circumstances the Australian Government allows normal economic relations with South Africa, but without avoidable official assistance. In accordance with this policy, all governmental promotion of trade and investment in South Africa has ceased and Trade Commissioner activities at the Johannesburg post are limited to providing basic market information and assistance to Australian exporters. In addition, EFIC investment insurance, export insurance under national interest provisions and finance on concessational terms are not available.

The legal aid application referred to in the letter was made a number of years ago to the Australian Legal Aid Office in Victoria. That office has now been absorbed by the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria, an independent, statutory body established under State legislation. The Commission has inquired into the allegation and has advised that in 1977 the Australian Legal Aid Office refused legal aid to the applicant because the legal proceedings for which aid had been sought were considered not to have reasonable prospects of success. That decision was taken in light of an opinion to this effect provided to the Office by counsel.

The amounts provided between 1974-75 and 1977-78 were $28.1m for the Macarthur Growth Centre and $17m for the Land Commission of New South Wales.
