                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:01</span>):  This bill, the Ending Native Forest Logging Bill 2023, seeks to put an end to the outdated practice of destroying biodiversity by the industrial logging of our native forests, which also, of course, contributes massively to the breakdown of the planet's climate, which is happening as we speak here today. This bill seeks to put an end to the practice of logging public forests in Australia by repealing the Regional Forest Agreements Act 2002, closing a massive loophole in our environment laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How do we find ourselves here today, in 2024, still debating whether industrial native forest logging, a mendicant and massive loss-making industry that only survives because of the rivers of gold that flow into it from Commonwealth and state coffers, should continue? How do we find ourselves in the middle of the twin crises of climate breakdown and ecological and biodiversity collapse debating whether industrial native forest logging should be allowed to continue to massively contribute to both of those travesties? How do we find ourselves here today having to defend magnificent, carbon-rich, biodiverse old-growth forests? How do we find ourselves here today having to debate whether trees that were already ancient when Europeans arrived to colonise this country over 200 years ago should be clear felled and fed into the woodchip machines? How do we find ourselves here today debating whether we should keep logging the swift parrot into extinction—that beautiful little bird? How do we find ourselves here today having to debate whether the Leadbeater's possum habitat should continue to be logged or whether masked owl habitat should continue to be destroyed?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll tell you how we find ourselves here today, colleagues. It's because the establishment parties in this country—those parties that are becoming harder and harder to tell apart—still support all of those practices: the destruction of nature, the breakdown of our climate and the destruction of the Aboriginal cultural heritage that exists in the very lands and forests that are being logged. They still support the ongoing public subsidies to a mendicant industry for base political purposes and because they are captured by the logging corporations in the same way that they are captured by the big fossil fuel, supermarket and banking corporations—and the list goes on. The agents of corporate profiteering in this place continue to refuse to take action to defend our forests, protect our climate and look after the Australian people and, in fact, people right around the world. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">RFAs had a stated threefold purpose. That purported purpose was to protect biodiversity, secure employment and provide resource security, but RFAs have comprehensively failed to deliver on all three of those purported purposes. Firstly, on resource security—an epic fail. They sought to provide resource security by logging in guaranteed volumes of sawlogs and woodchips, but markets have moved on. People now want ethically sourced wood. They want their wood to be from plantations or from recycled timbers and, at the very least, they want their timbers certified by acceptable certification schemes. What they don't want are timbers sourced from destroying native forests. We are in the early stages of a climate catastrophe, and we continue to fell at an industrial scale. We continue to devastate our carbon-rich native forests for low-value products that very quickly release their carbon back into the atmosphere—all made possible by government subsidies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of employment, again, this is a mendicant industry. In my home state of Tasmania there are more newsagents than there are people who work in the native forest logging industry. This industry can only survive because of taxpayer largesse delivered and facilitated by the establishment parties in this place. In Tasmania, the Liberal state government is trying to open up 40,000 hectares of high conservation value native forests that were actually protected under the Tasmanian forest agreement, an agreement that was ripped up by that very same Liberal government. In Tasmania, we currently see truckloads of unprocessed native forest timber being transported to mainland Australia, again with subsidies from the taxpayer, via the Freight Equalisation Scheme—yet another government subsidy for an industry that is financially unviable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the greatest failure of RFAs is their failure and inability to protect biodiversity. RFAs enable a carve-out from our environment laws. Let's be very clear about that. If a forest is being logged under an RFA, it is not protected by the already very weak environment laws that exist in this country. Labor made a promise to the Australian people in the lead-up to the latest election. That promise was that they would fix our broken environment laws. What have they done? They have broken that promise. Never trust Labor on the environment. They've broken that promise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only have they broken that promise, but you've got the Prime Minister floating the prospect of a dirty deal with the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Dutton, to further weaken our already broken environment laws, which even in their current form exist not to protect our environment but to facilitate the destruction of nature. It is absolutely unacceptable for Labor to break a solemn commitment they gave to the Australian people to fix our broken environment laws. Worse than that, they've started engaging in a backsliding way with the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Dutton, to facilitate further weakening of our environment laws for the benefit of climate- and nature-destroying corporations. That is what is going on at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a pathway to passing stronger environment laws through this parliament if Labor would get on board and engage in a good-faith way with the Greens and the crossbench. There is a pathway to fixing our broken environment laws so that they actually do the job that most people think they exist to do, and that is to protect nature and our climate. The pathway is for Labor to engage in good faith with the Australian Greens and the crossbench in this place and to actually sit down and work through a proposal that will strengthen environment laws, protect nature and protect us from contributing to the breakdown of the climate. That is what Labor needs to do.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the reason we know that our environment laws need to be improved is an independent review of the EPBC Act led by Professor Graeme Samuel. I do note that the Samuel review recommended repealing the RFA exemptions—that is, bringing logging back within the ambit of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Of course, if it were back within the ambit, at least consideration would need to be given to the fact that, for example, swift parrot habitat in Tasmania is being destroyed—absolutely flattened—and that beautiful little parrot is being logged into extinction. But at the moment, because of the carve-out for RFAs, those matters aren't even considered under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we Australian Greens want to see is an end to native forest logging in Australia. It is an outdated practice, it should be condemned to the last century, and it should end. It should end to protect the cultural heritage that exists over all of this country. We still have significant unfinished business in terms of the treaty or treaties with First Nations people and making sure their cultural heritage is adequately protected and respected in this country. Native forest logging should end because it is a massive contributor to the climate crisis. Native forest logging should end because it is destroying biodiversity in the middle of a biodiversity crisis. Native forest logging should end because it is a crime against nature.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What a travesty it is that environmentalists here in Australia are currently being arrested, prosecuted and in some cases jailed for defending our forests. Meanwhile, the people who should be prosecuted—the people who are facilitating the logging of these forests by the ongoing public subsidies into a loss-making industry and by the political protection that the industry enjoys—are not being prosecuted. They're going scot-free and making an absolute motza from the destruction of nature and the destruction of our forests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Native forest logging should end because it is condemning multiple species to a slide into extinction. Native forest logging should end because it is a mendicant industry that cannot survive without massive public subsidies. Native forest logging should end because it's a carbon bomb. What happens after the utter swathe of destruction is cut through beautiful, magnificent forests is that helicopters fly over them and drop napalm-like substances into the forest and it goes up in smoke and flames—a massive carbon belch into the atmosphere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People are dying around the world because of climate change at the moment. The United Nations is warning that the planet is losing its capacity to sustain human life, and yet somehow the establishment parties in this place still think it's okay to publicly subsidise the destruction of our native forest, the destruction of nature and the breakdown of our climate in the year 2024, when the science is settled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know what we're doing. No-one in here can claim that you don't know what you're doing. You all know exactly what you're doing. You're behaving in a psychopathic way, where you are prioritising profit over the potential future survival of these species. That's what you're doing. These are beautiful forests—our magnificent forests. There are the amazing, complex, beautiful creatures that live in them—the complex web of life that is the ecosystem of these forests, much of which is unseen because it is giant fungal networks underground. There are giant populations of things like earthworms and beetles right through to beautiful, precious birds like the swift parrot and the masked owl. This complex, awesome web of life is being destroyed because the Labor and Liberal parties are captured by profit. They are captured by the big forestry corporations, just like they're captured by the big fossil fuel corporations.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator URQUHART</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:16</span>):  The Australian government does not support the repeal of the RFA Act. The government has committed to supporting the ongoing operation of RFAs while also strengthening environmental protections. This will be achieved by applying new national environmental standards to RFAs. The Australian government is committed to providing a framework that allows sustainable native forestry to occur. The government is committed to continuing to work with stakeholders towards applying new national environment standards to regional forest agreements. This will support the ongoing operation of RFAs whilst strengthening environmental protections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our forest product industries are vital to our regional communities. They directly employ 51,000 people, and tens of thousands more jobs are indirectly supported by this sector, which contributes nearly $24 billion to the national economy each year. The benefits of a competitive, sustainable and renewable forestry industry in our regional communities should not be underestimated. It delivers positive economic, social and environmental outcomes. In addition to employment and income throughout the supply chain, it also underpins the social networks and the fabric of many of our regional towns and communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's native forest management is sustainable and does not lead to deforestation. Our native forests are regenerated after harvesting. Repealing the RFA Act and terminating RFAs will not end native forestry, as these are state government decisions. Rather, terminating RFAs will mean forest operations will be subject to EPBC Act assessments, potentially at the coupe level. This may undermine the landscape-scale approach taken to forestry approvals under RFAs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Repealing the RFA Act will result in industry uncertainty that could lead to job losses and mill closures in regional areas. This, in turn, could compromise the future of many of our regional towns and constrain our ability to prevent and respond to bushfire effects through the reduction of the skilled workforce and machinery required for quick responses to fires and fire mitigation operations. Repealing the RFA Act will lead to increased administrative costs for forestry operators and for governments, and that will result in backlogs and possible delays in forestry approvals and in assessing applications for wood exports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government is expanding Australia's plantation forest estate, but plantation wood is not able to replace the high-quality wood sourced from native forests. Because of the choice of species and site and short rotations, most Australian hardwood plantations do not develop the same size, strength and appearance properties as wood sourced from native forests. It would place further pressure on domestic supply chains for products that are able to be sourced only from native forests and create an increased dependence on substitutes—imports—for native hardwoods from places where forest management standards may not be as high and where wood production may be associated with deforestation and illegal logging. These are some of the many reasons the Australian government does not support the repeal of the RFA Act.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:20</span>):  It is a pleasure to rise and speak in defence of a very proud and sustainable industry in our country, one that has been the political whipping boy for many a decade, sadly, and, frankly, for no reason other than arguments based on emotion in pursuit of votes in inner-city suburbs where falsehoods are peddled at the expense of science and livelihoods in communities where people are doing the best they can to earn an honest living. These are the people who are in the firing line. These are the people who work in an industry that, as I say—based on science, based on fact—is doing the right thing and should not be targeted in the way that it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The net effect, as Senator Urquhart rightly points out, of what the Greens propose to do with the Ending Native Forest Logging Bill 2023 is worse for our environment than they claim. They think that ending native forest logging in this country, repealing the RFA Act and ensuring that every coupe that is ever harvested in a native forest in a sustainable and science-based way is assessed by the EPBC Act is somehow going to protect the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we saw in Victoria that when a certain retail chain in Australia decided not to stock Victorian native timbers as a result of a court case, a legal question before the courts that had not yet been decided upon, they of course didn't lose demand for the product. They had to continue to stock products that were equivalent to the native forest hardwoods. The only difference was that they weren't coming from Victoria; they were coming from somewhere else, in many cases from overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the problem with this argument. When you look around this chamber and the houses we live in and you look at the beautiful staircases, benchtops, coffee tables, window frames and the like, they don't come out of plantation forests, as Senator Urquhart has said. They come out of sustainably managed, science-based management approaches to these coupes—native forests, because of their strength and appearance characteristics. They're not coming out of Australian forests, as we go around the countryside shutting them down based on emotion and not science. They come out of forests overseas, where jurisdictions managing these forests don't care about the environmental outcomes. If we're supposed to be global leaders when it comes to looking after our planet as a developed nation, should we not be guiding others to support science-based best practice management of our resources, including forestry? Should we not be ensuring that we lead the way? And we do lead the way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the net effect of this bill before us now is that we stop doing what we do to world's best standard here because we don't care what happens over the horizon, what happens in the Congo basin, where they rip trees out of the ground, never to be replanted. Industries in that part of the world of course have the smell of modern slavery attached to them—but hey, we're okay with that, because it's not our forests that are being harvested; it doesn't matter what happens outside our backyard! This is the net effect of emotion driven, divisive Greens politics, which is what this bill is all about. That is the worst part about it. We can feel good because we haven't cut down our forests, because they look terrible when they're cut down. This inflammatory language around what happens in our forests as a result of sustainable science-based native forest management makes people think that it is a bad thing. I have sympathy for those who over time have fallen for these silly arguments that are not based on science. Bad decisions have been made time after time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator McKim, in his contribution, talked about deals. He talked about dirty deals being done. I gather that's with reference to a bill that's coming before the Senate soon enough. I'll tell you a thing or two about deals. I'm a Tasmanian, and I remember some deals that have been done over time in my home state of Tasmania. They were deals that have been very bad for our environment, very bad for our economy and very bad for our state as a whole. These are deals that are often done, sadly, between the Greens and the Labor Party. I know there are people here who lament those decisions and others who, terribly, celebrate them. The point is: these are the deals that are done based on emotion, based on a political whim and based on the pursuit of votes in inner-city areas, not in the regions, where the people who know how to manage the land are doing the best they can to earn an honest living. That is the point I make.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, the challenge laid down every time we have this debate in this place and in other parliaments around Australia is: tell us where they do it better and tell us where they cut down trees and use them for productive purposes. Trees, of course, are a great carbon sink, especially when harvested sustainably. There is carbon locked up in all of the timber in this chamber, would you believe? It's never going to escape, unless we burn the place down—and there may be some, sadly, who would like to do that. The point is that every time you harvest timber the carbon that has been sequestered by that tree is stored in that felled tree in perpetuity. You plant another tree; it continues to absorb carbon. That is the point of our industry, the forestry industry, being the ultimate renewable and the best 'carbon sequesterer' of all primary industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Claims are being made about it being destructive when it comes to the carbon challenge that this world faces. On that, I think it is important for us to focus on the fact that Australia contributes, I think, 1.1 per cent of global emissions. So shutting down the forestry industry, which only, in their arguments, contributes to a portion of that global 1.1 per cent, is not going to turn the dial on what places like the Congo basin do when it comes to ripping trees out of the ground, burning the life out of the ground behind them and never replacing them with a single stick anywhere, at any point in time. That is deforestation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't participate in the act of deforestation here, contrary to the claims that are being made. That is bad for the environment, that is bad for climate change—not the Australian approach to this—and that's why these facts are so critically important. If we were contributing to 70 per cent of global emissions then, sure, maybe I'd listen to what Senator McKim has to say. But the reality is it's 1.1 per cent of global emissions, a small portion of that relating to forestry, yet suddenly we now need to shut down the industry and push it off over the horizon to countries where it will be far worse for carbon emissions, climate change and the environment and far worse when it comes to the economy—in fact, bad all round.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go back to the point around custodians of the land. Foresters are excellent custodians of our land. They know a thing or two about forest management. They don't just run around the countryside and our forests wielding chainsaws, not caring about what they cut down and what they leave. They actually do care about having a sustainable industry, where forests produce the timber they need to have a sustainable industry into the future. They are not in any way reckless or careless about it. They are governed by, at a state level—for example, in the state of Tasmania—some of the most rigid rules around the management of forests, through the Forest Practices Authority. They have to get a forest practices plan before they go into a coupe. It takes into account every bit of cultural heritage, every area of environmental sensitivity and any presence of a threatened species, like the wedge-tailed eagle or similar—a swift parrot habitat might also be identified. Those things are taken into account, and foresters in Tasmania, like they do in other parts of the country, observe those rules. That is why they know how best to manage our forests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to contrast that with something. I was taken down to some very deep dark parts of the Huon Valley in recent times to visit a coupe near the Arve River. This swathe of forest is now under World Heritage wilderness protection. It is protected under the highest level of protection that could ever be afforded a forest on our planet, and we respect that. It is a testament to our native forestry industry doing its best based on science to manage our forests that these forests, harvested once if not twice over modern times, are now protected as part of a World Heritage wilderness area. They're not virgin, pristine rainforests that have never been touched by man. They are former production forests. In fact, mining operations exist in there. There are timber tramways and a range of human objects and interactions that exist in these areas which are now World Heritage. All or a good portion of it has been logged and regenerated by these evil foresters the Greens talk about!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one patch, however, that you can see from Google Earth that hasn't been managed in the same way, right in the middle of this beautiful swathe of forest in the south-west of Tasmania. You can see from Google Earth that it's a gravel patch. You might have thought it was a former quarry. In fact, no; this was the same as everything else in that part of Tasmania. It was a beautiful forest that had been managed sustainably for productive purposes over more than 100 years. There's an environmental group in Tasmania—Environment Tasmania—that were given a grant by the former Labor government and the then Minister for the Environment, Minister Tony Burke, to go and do what they thought was best for the environment. That gravel pit, part of a World Heritage wilderness area that stands out on Google Earth for all to see as a testament to how inner-city environmentalists would approach forest management, shows you that their denial of forest science doesn't work. Foresters fell the trees. They do a regeneration burn so that the seeds of those particular species can germinate and grow into what now has become a World Heritage wilderness area. This environmental group refused to do that. When they let this coupe sit there for a number of years with this grant of taxpayers' money, the rains came, as they do in south-western Tasmania, and washed away what saplings there were and the topsoil with them. Because they refused to follow the science—science based on the traditional techniques of Indigenous Australians—all that remains today is a gravel pit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the environmentalists' answer for forest management in this country. They say, 'We've got to ban native forestry, because it's bad for the environment, but we will lock up swathes of land managed by native forest loggers for World Heritage purposes.' Those are in contrast with the patch of land that environmentalists manage, which is nothing more than a gravel pit. It does rather point to the fact that everything you heard before from the proponents of this bill is not based on fact. It is not based on science. It is pure ideology and will have bad outcomes not only for our environment, as demonstrated by what I've just said, but for the global environment. We should be global leaders when it comes to that. Of course, shutting down an industry has economic effects. I have before me the packaging of copy paper that we have available to us in this House. Would you believe we don't actually produce copy paper in this country anymore—which is a crime! There are many workers who have worked in mills over many years, proudly using Australian-sourced material to make Australian copy paper. We don't do that here. This package is produced in Indonesia. Would the Greens say that Indonesia does forestry and downstream processing better than here in Australia? Do they look after their workers over there better than we do? No, they don't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Offshoring forestry and downstream processing is the by-product of supporting bills like this. They don't care. They really don't care where we get our paper and timber from or what happens to the environment over the horizon, as long as their political games are played to the best advantage possible. That's the problem. This is the same party whose leader famously spoke back in 1981 in opposition to renewable energy. Dams in Tasmania produce 100 per cent green energy which is now the envy of the nation as we transition out of coal and gas. Bob Brown, former senator and head of the Bob Brown Foundation, said that coal-fired power was the best option. He doesn't believe that anymore, but it does rather prove the point around the arguments that Mr Brown and others in the green movement use. They deploy at a point in time something they think is part of the zeitgeist—popular. They tap into an emotive stream in the community to get a political outcome. That political outcome, can I tell you, Acting Deputy President Sterle, is immensely destructive. It's bad for the environment, as we've just demonstrated clearly. It's bad for the economy. It's bad for climate change. There is no common sense, there is no human decency and there is no scientific basis to what they're proposing here. I implore all senators to vote against this disastrous bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:35</span>):  And what do the Greens do? After finally showing their true colours as the party of Hamas, as the party of left-wing union thuggery, donations and bribes, as the party of communism and as the party of environmental destruction in the name of net zero energy, they have a problem. Their traditional base of decent Australians concerned about the natural environment is turning away from the watermelon Greens. So here's the Greens' answer: resurrect a bill which was already defeated because it's a stupid bill and use this to pretend the Greens still care about our precious natural environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The intention of this bill is in the name: ending native forest logging. Regional forest agreements will be made subservient to environmental regulations which will tie logging down in the courts and bring logging to an end. End logging and all those workers, many of them fine union members, will be out of a job. It is logging that produces timber for, amongst other things, the very seats the Greens are sitting in today, right now, which were made from logged native timber—Western Australian jarrah and Tasmanian myrtle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Putting aside their hypocrisy, it's clear the Greens think their supporters can be gullibly convinced by a superficial virtue-signalling stunt. After all, who would oppose protecting native forests? Actually, the Greens oppose protecting native forests. Greens' energy policies are blasting the tops off mountains in old-growth forests to erect 300-metre-high wind turbines. They're clear-felling thousands of kilometres of forest for access roads and the power transmission lines to get the power hundreds of kilometres back to the city—thousands of kilometres, in fact, back to the city. Thousands of hectares of native forest are being permanently destroyed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Blasting has released arsenic previously locked in sandstone into our waterways and aquifers. In the case of the Atherton Tableland in pristine North Queensland, aquifers contaminated with arsenic will eventually come to the surface in the middle of the Great Barrier Reef, through underground basins. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike forest taken for logging, forest damage from net zero energy is not regrown. The access roads are required for maintenance for the life of the turbine. The transmission lines are permanent. Unlike coalmines that are remediated at the end of the mine, there's no remediation bond on industrial wind, solar and transmission lines, so these things will be a rusting blight on the landscape for a hundred years, for the community to pay for, for taxpayers to pay to rehabilitate and for farmers to rehabilitate. The Greens are environmental vandals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I tell you who does support protecting native forests: One Nation. We would end the environmental destruction from net zero energy measures and would restrict solar panels to built-up areas where the energy is needed. We would end any new wind turbine subsidies and instead promote vertical wind technology. One Nation will prevent logging in old-growth forests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional forest agreements are an accord between the federal, state and local governments to supervise the timber industry. This means the Greens believe they know better than the state governments—all six of them—who have been managing their forests for 200 years. Aboriginals have been managing Australia's forests for tens of thousands of years, including through the use of burning off. Each state government consults with Aboriginal communities in the development of regional forest agreements. Aboriginal voices only matter, though, to the Greens when they can be exploited to advance Greens technology and lock Aboriginals into victimhood and dependency. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Generations of ongoing development of forestry agreements, planning out supply and demand, protecting sensitive habitats and protecting old-growth forests—all that great work involving communities, industry and government—is torn up and thrown away because the Greens think they know better. They are playing God, playing tsar. What an ego—and to what benefit?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are proclaiming their love of housing and promising to build more houses than anyone else. The question arises: out of what are they going to build those houses? The Greens want to shut down the Australian forestry industry, the conventional steel industry, the gas industry, the diesel industry and the cement industry. The Greens are proposing to build houses without timber, steel or concrete. Well, the last time I looked, pixie dust was not a building material. Does the CFMEU know they're hopping into bed with a political party that would remove from the market all the materials tradies need to build a new home and build new apartment towers while also removing diesel for tradies' generators and utes, which they now propose to tax out of existence?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want to confuse the feelings coming from my left with facts, yet that's what I do. I deal in facts. At last mapping, there were 131½ million hectares of native forest in Australia, which is 17 per cent of Australia's land area, and there were 1.8 million hectares of commercial plantations, including pines and eucalypts. This is where most logging occurs, yet it's not enough to sustain Australia's demand for timber. There are 30 million hectares of land, most of that privately owned, which can be logged under the careful management of regional forest agreements. Last year, two per cent of those 30 million hectares were logged, meaning Australia is logging 600,000 hectares out of the 133 million hectares available, less than one half of one per cent of our native forests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What happens when a forest is logged? Is it clear-felled, never to grow anything again? Of course not. Forestry is about renewal. That's the whole point of regional forestry agreements. The logging industry is allowed to go in and take the productive timber, remove the stunted and useless timber and then leave that forest to regenerate for 10 years or so before returning to repeat the cycle. Habitat is not destroyed; it's enhanced. Forests are not destroyed; they're enhanced. Rather than helping our forests, this Greens bill will harm them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Logging removes the fuel from the forest. It thins the trees and protects native forest from bushfires. There are huge areas of this country that have never fully recovered from the bushfires during the drought, because some native forests contain so much fuel they burned like hell. What happened to the wildlife the Greens profess to care so much about? They were incinerated—agonisingly, cruelly incinerated. The damage to native flora and fauna caused in those bushfires resulted directly from restrictions on burn-offs, something sensible forest management would have mediated. They tried to, but the Greens stopped it. This is the problem with communists. They think imperious proclamations are a substitute for good government facts and data. They are wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear: it has been illegal to log old-growth forests for the entirety of this century. I know there has been some intrusion into old-growth forests. This bill from the Greens won't deal with that problem, though, because the intrusion is mostly coming from the construction of wind turbines, access roads, solar panels and transmission lines, which the Greens adore and love and drive. Illegal logging, logging that damages old-growth forests, must be prosecuted, and One Nation will prosecute offenders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation opposes this bill, because we are the party of the environment and we know the current system is best for the environment. As someone who has personally planted thousands of trees, rehabilitated land and protected coastlines, I know One Nation is now the party of the natural environment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:44</span>):  I actually agree with a lot of what Senator Roberts has said. Hypocrisy, thy name is Greens. Yet again, we see the Greens trying to absolve their guilt by exporting our problems. What we see time and time again is the Greens trying to shut down industry in Australia and trying to shut down productivity in Australia, but they're not actually doing anything to sort out the demand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are supply-and-demand scenarios across the board. We shouldn't grow rice in Australia but we can eat rice because it's a healthy food—it's not red meat. So, to lower emissions, we've got to have a vegetarian diet, but we can't grow our own rice, so we'll take rice from countries that have lesser environmental records, worse workplace practices and worse chemical usage rather than have a very sustainable rice industry here in Australia. We shouldn't grow cotton in Australia because, apparently, cotton is a very evil crop, despite the fact that it is an annual crop and can be turned off and on depending on the weather conditions for the season. It is sustainable. Australia grows the most water-efficient cotton in the world and it is a natural fibre, but we shouldn't grow it here in Australia because the Greens don't like it. The Greens don't want to see us use our water on growing a cotton crop, but they're happy to take cotton from other nations with lesser environmental standards, worse chemical usage standards and worse workplace practices, because it makes them feel good. And now, today, we see the Greens, again, trying to absolve their guilt, saying we need to end our native forest logging here in Australia so they can feel good about themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we're not going to stop needing hardwood timber products—so what is the solution? How do we meet the Greens' demands to fix the housing crisis if we can't access hardwood timber for the housing frames? The only solution is that we import the timber. And where do we import it from? Guess what? From countries that do not have the same environmental standards, workplace standards or human rights standards. They want to shut down one of the world's most sustainable logging industries that is highly regulated, is actually good for the environment and contributes to Australia's carbon capture and storage targets so that they can import timber products from countries that see trees ripped out of the ground, with no requirements to replant them, and native habitats in countries overseas absolutely destroyed. But it's okay because the Greens can sit back within this place with halos on, telling the government they've got to fix everything from housing crises to food shortages, but they can't do it with anything we actually grow and produce in this country; they've got to look overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Who bears the brunt of these misplaced policies? It is Australian consumers that are already paying for this Labor government's failed economic policies. Can you imagine if, after the next election, we are confronted with a minority Greens-Labor government, and what that will lead to? We will see the demise of some of our last remaining highly productive industries because the Greens won't let us dig anything out of the ground, the Greens won't let us grow anything with irrigated agriculture and the Greens won't let us sustainably harvest our timber products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me remind people that in Australia, under our laws, native trees that are harvested must be replanted so that they can be harvested again. It is a renewable product. Trees, as they grow, absorb carbon, and when they are harvested and turned into a timber product that carbon is captured permanently. As Senator Roberts said, across our country there's only about 134 million hectares of native forests. On an annual basis, only 0.06 per cent that area is harvested. That is only six out of every 10,000 trees. This is not an unsustainable industry; this is a highly sustainable industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And I repeat, demand for these products is not going down. In fact, demand for these products is increasing. We have a growing population. We have migration through the roof, under the Labor government's policies, and we are struggling to house people. And yet the Greens solution is to cease producing one of the fundamental inputs for housing construction. But not on this side of the chamber, not over here. We support our forestry industry, which employs thousands of people—from the loggers to the truckies that transport the logs to the sawmillers who turn the logs into the end-use products and to the retailers that actually onsell the products. We support them. We stand behind our forestry industry because our forestry industry is sustainable. They use science. They incorporate science into their daily procedures. They measure. They leave the remnant trees behind to ensure that there are enough knotholes and habitat for our native flora and fauna.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, just this morning I heard a report from Coffs Harbour about Forestry New South Wales. They've actually ceased harvesting timber in an area where an emu nest was found. This is a small, isolated emu species. They suspect there are only 50 left in the wild. Forestry New South Wales found a nest where the father was sitting on eggs with the chicks. They ceased harvesting and activity in the area to let those chicks hatch. And while Saving our Species went and harvested a number of the eggs to incubate, hoping they'd hatch, they also left some with the father. I'm very pleased to report that the father sat on three of those eggs, and two of them successfully hatched. And now that emu and his chicks are wandering through that area of forestry because our native timber loggers and foresters care. They care about our environment. They want to make sure they operate sustainably. They want to make sure that we have healthy native flora and fauna in these areas, and that's why they only take six out of every 10,000 trees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We won't be supporting this bill by any measure. We will be supporting our forestry industry. I urge this chamber to vote against this bill.</span>

I associate myself with the comments already made by my Greens colleague Senator Nick McKim.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is 2024. We are facing a biodiversity crisis across the world. The climate is getting worse and worse, there's extreme weather, there's the rising temperature of our oceans and there's the lack of protection of our native animals and plant species. And yet we have laws in this country that allow the continued destruction—the bulldozing, the logging—of our native and ancient forests. It is just appalling that, despite all of the smarts in the world, Australia continues to log our native forests and destroy our ancient woodlands. It's time this ended. If we don't end it now, there won't be much left.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have iconic species, like the koala, on the brink of the extinction, and, rather than protecting their homes, we have laws in this country that allow the loggers to go in and chop down their homes in our native forests. Australians are disgusted that this happens. They have been disgusted for a number of years—decades. Every time the community is asked whether native forest logging should continue, overwhelmingly the majority of Australians say: 'No. Protect what is there, save it for the future and ensure that it's there for the next generation.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to save our forests not just because they are part of our natural history and heritage, they are the homes of our native species and they help create the ecosystems that underpin all life but also because they are crucial in our battle against climate change. They are the lungs of the planet. We need our ancient forests and our native forests there to ensure that we can stop the worst of climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our governments around the country, in states like Tasmania and New South Wales, that continue to allow the logging of native forests in their jurisdictions are doing so at the cost of Australian taxpayers, so, not only is this costing nature, costing climate action and making it harder and harder for us to arrest the dangers of global warming and stop the spiralling, out-of-control extinction of native species like the swift parrot, the greater glider and the koala; it's actually being done at the expense of the economy and at the expense of taxpayer money. It is mind-boggling that any government in 2024 could continue to argue that taxpayers' money should be able to be spent propping up an industry that destroys native forests. It is time that this ended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is timely because we are in the midst of a debate in this place about Australia's failing environmental laws. The government have put forward an environmental protection agency, but they have no laws to protect nature, no laws to protect our native forests from the bulldozers and the chainsaws and no laws to protect koalas from having their homes logged and destroyed, so what will this environmental protection agency do? It has nothing to implement. It has no laws to oversee that actually look after nature and protect our forests, our wildlife and our woodlands. It will be a missed opportunity if we don't do something now. The government want a cop on the beat for our environment, but they've given the cop no laws to implement. We need to fix that, and one of the key things we can do to fix that is pass this bill today.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The community is shocked at knowing there's a loophole in Australian law that allows—encourages, funds—the destruction of our native forests rather than protecting them. And in whose hands is the power to stop this? This chamber's—right now, today. This is a challenge to both sides. The Labor Party and the coalition talk a big game on nature, talk a big game on industry, talk a big game on futureproofing, but they've done nothing to futureproof the sustainability of our environment, our land, our clean air and clean water while they continue to allow this destruction of our native forests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're debating this issue in the chamber right now, on the other side of the building the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, is on stage having a nice chitchat with the head of the Minerals Council about how to make laws more friendly for the big mining corporations rather than fixing the laws to save our native forests and protect our koalas. That's the priority of this government. The Greens are in here fighting for our forests, and the environment minister is on the other side of the building having a nice chitchat with the mining lobby.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are so disappointed in this government. Your Prime Minister promised to fix Australia's broken environment laws and to do something to make sure stronger laws would be implemented. And you've caved, you've capitulated, you've gone to water because Gina Rinehart wants to keep digging, bulldozing and polluting. You've gone to water because the loggers want to keep the chainsaws going, the bulldozers going and the trees falling. Rather than protecting the environment, the environment minister is hanging out with the Minerals Council. That says everything about the priorities of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, the Greens will fight for this. We will take this right through to the election, and we will make sure every voter knows that if you care about the environment, if you want to stop the climate crisis, if you want to stop the logging and stop the pollution there's only one option, and you've got to vote Greens. The choice is crystal clear. You can't keep voting for this mob or that mob if you want to save the planet. They're not up to it. They're chicken scared. They've got no spine, and they can't be trusted.</span>

The Treasurer did this in good faith to protect business information and to ensure that we can continue to undertake robust and frank stakeholder consultations which are ultimately in the public interest. These protections are in the legislation so that stakeholders can engage in consultation without fear that their business information will be compromised, and the same rules apply to all parties that engage in consultation. We want to continue to have frank and candid consultation processes in the future, and that's why we comply and did comply in this instance with the FOI Act.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:</span>  Resume your seat, Senator. There is no point of order. That's a debating point. Minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator GALLAGHER:</span>
                    </a>  Thank you—as Senator Scarr knows. We released the relevant documents on 5 September 2024, in line with the Information Commissioner's decision, in the usual way. I would say in the time allowed for me that this is just a continuation in another form of the coalition's war against super, particularly Senator Bragg's war against super. He seeks to undermine the superannuation industry and compulsory superannuation requirements in this country. Let's just be honest about what is actually the issue here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, at every opportunity the coalition gets—right back from the John Howard days and all through the days of all the leaders of the coalition—they have sought to undermine compulsory super, the superannuation industry and, in particular, the role of the labour movement in the superannuation industry, which is, again, what Senator Bragg seeks to do with his continued attack, including in a piece in the paper that I read this morning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know and we saw it yesterday again with an announcement of the amendments that the coalition are going to move in relation to super on PPL. They cannot bear compulsory superannuation. They just cannot bear it. They dress it up, as Senator Cash just did, saying, 'We prefer choice.' Well, the choice at the moment is that women retire with a lot less super than men. Economic inequality is a problem in this country for women. You call it choice; we call it inequality. That's what Labor seeks to address in everything we do—to ensure that we are upholding equality for women, that we are representing their long-term interests and that we don't support this kind of underhanded, continued attack that undermines super. They are even prepared to do it on paid parental leave. We know that that is a massive issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Bragg will take any opportunity he gets to undermine the superannuation industry. If he can besmirch industry super at the same time, then that's an added bonus for him. That's what he's seeking to do with this and with the attendance of the minister today. I've explained the process that the Treasurer went through, and I and Labor will continue to argue for the benefits of compulsory super so people are able to retire with the benefits of their hardworking lives reflected in a dignified retirement because they have superannuation assets. We think that is a good thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition thinks it's a bad thing. They want to undermine it and tear at it. If they were in government, they would seek to do that again and again. They've opposed it from the get-go. Every single change that we seek to bring in to strengthen super is a change they will undermine. If they can undermine the industry that represents working people and their retirement savings, they will do that as well. That is the point of this attendance today. We aren't going to be suckered into your war on super, Senator Bragg. It's something you've done since the moment you got here, and I imagine you will continue until the moment you leave. But, at the same time, Labor will always stand up for super, including industry super.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In those last five minutes of this attendance motion, we heard from Senator Gallagher a slew of insults, a number of personal slights and a real lack of detail that I and the Australian people would have expected from an explanation as to why the Treasurer, Mr Chalmers, told untruths to this Senate when he filed a public interest immunity claim. The most disappointing thing is that the government came into office promising integrity and transparency, but what we've seen has been a series of cover-ups to protect vested interests. This has been a government for vested interests. And the reason that I filed these claims in relation to freedom of information was because I was suspicious that the government for vested interests had inappropriate lobbying from Cbus Super, the superannuation industry and various unions on matters of public policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I suspected correctly that this was happening. The FOI request of March 2023 came back with a redacted response in September 2023. Then I filed an order for the production of documents in the Senate, which was supported by the crossbench. I want to put on record my thanks to the crossbench for standing for integrity and transparency in relation to these matters when the government has failed to meet the standards that it set at the last election when it promised it would be an organisation that would stand for transparency and integrity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In November 2023, the response to the OPD from Mr Chalmers was that the government would not release these files from Cbus to the Treasurer and that there was a public interest immunity claim from the Treasurer which said that a disclosure of the documents sought would provide an unfair advantage into Cbus's private opinions and business affairs, and this would destroy commercial-in-confidence information. We appealed that to the information commissioner in November 2023, and we received the outcome in August 2024 and the documents just last week. It took 18 months to get access to a document which had been provided by Cbus to the Treasurer, which was inappropriate lobbying that had nothing to do with commercial-in-confidence information. This is an incredible position that we're now in, where the Treasurer of the Commonwealth would make a false claim to the Senate—a lie—that there was commercial-in-confidence information provided by Cbus when there was none. The PII claim was falsely made, and the information commissioner itself said: 'I do not accept that the remaining material would cause detriment if it were disclosed. The remaining material does not contain commercial information about the fund.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, Senator Chisholm said that Cbus had objected to the release of these documents and that that's why the government didn't release them. But it's not up to Cbus to run the government. The government should be run by the people who have been elected by the Australian people, and it was for the Treasurer to make the judgement, in accordance with Senator Gallagher, that these matters were not commercial in confidence, and they should have been provided in accordance with the order made by the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was no commercial-in-confidence information. This information was all about a secret lobbying attempt so that Cbus could exempt itself from disclosing fees to members. They didn't want to show their members that they were incurring stamp duty costs when they were investing in property, because they are so desperate to become the corporate landlords of Australia. They want to own the Australian dream, and the Labor government have sought to help them cover up this secret lobbying with a cloak of commercial in confidence which is not there.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why it is very important that we get to the bottom of this, and that's why I again thank the crossbench for helping us bring on this motion. As former senator Patrick said in a piece on the weekend:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">How was it that Mr Bragg, as a private citizen, can get documents under FOI that Senator Bragg could not using the powers of the Senate?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Patrick goes on to say:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Ultimately, Chalmers' Senate betrayal is a betrayal of the Australian public—who are the real source of the Senate's power and purpose.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I think that is, really, the summary here. We are here to do the work of the public. We are here to expose wrongdoing and get to the bottom of things, and we're being obstructed by a government that promised integrity and transparency. This was a false public interest immunity claim. It had nothing to do with commercial-in-confidence information. It was all about secret lobbying which the Treasurer is ashamed of. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  I think Minister Gallagher has responded to the matter at hand. I am sick and tired of having to defend industry superannuation against constant attacks from the coalition. Senator Bragg should focus on the fact that Australian women retire with less in their superannuation balances than men, and that is just not fair. The coalition continually use superannuation as a political football for their own means. That is what this is about.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last night we heard the ridiculous suggestions from the coalition that women and families can make choices that suit them when it comes to draining their superannuation balances. At a time when they are having to look after a new family, they can make a very difficult choice and decide whether or not they take some money out of their superannuation account now, at the expense of a decent retirement later. This is outrageous. How is it a choice for women and families to drain their superannuation accounts, when we know that women over 50—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator DARMANIN:</span>
                    </a>  As I said earlier, I think Senator Gallagher has responded to the question at hand. Industry superannuation continues to be a point of discussion in this chamber. What I am simply talking about is the point that industry superannuation is not a political football. I have worked with hundreds of women who have watched the debate in these houses over the years. What they are interested in is making sure that governments do the right thing to ensure that they have a dignified and decent retirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Women in particular—I have worked with hundreds of them over many years—are worried about their future. They are worried and they are concerned that our governments should be looking after what should be in their balances at the end rather than point scoring around what might be determined to be the issue of the day. We know that women over 50 are the largest cohort of people who are becoming homeless, and they are approaching retirement with 25 per cent less superannuation than men. Australian women want our government and the opposition to focus on financial security in retirement for all of us. Unlike those opposite, Labor will always stand for the right of working women to retire with dignity and security while protecting our superannuation that is the envy of the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the point around families making this so-called choice to withdraw their superannuation early: I wonder whether the coalition understand what compounding interest is, or, if they do, whether they think that is just a concept that is good for men. When people are given a choice to take out their superannuation when they are younger in their careers, they miss out on the compounding interest benefits that will benefit them in retirement. Women, on average, as I said, have 25 per cent less superannuation than men when they are approaching retirement. I think they want somewhere to live and they also want to have security when they retire.</span>

                    </a>  I'll finish with this final point, on a theme that I believe is relevant and is worth mentioning: we have a situation where we know that women are the predominant beneficiaries of some of the reforms this government has brought in around closing the gender pay gap, enabling superannuation payments on paid parental leave to address the issue of women retiring with less in their balances than men, to address the concerns around women becoming homeless and to address women feeling secure after a lifetime of work, for the simple fact that they might be taking career breaks to look after family. I think we should be focusing on those things, not continuing to use superannuation as a political football like those opposite.</span>

So this concept that there is some sort of war on superannuation from this side of politics is absolute nonsense. I should say that my super fund, AustralianSuper, lost $1.1 billion in an investment in Pluralsight; I'd like some transparency over that, please!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm a member of an industry super fund and I believe in super. I think it's an important part of protecting people's retirement. All the nonsense we heard was deflection from three fundamental points. First is the fact that this Senate, the representatives of the Australian people in this Senate, sought these documents from the Treasurer. The representatives representing the majority of the Australian people, on their behalf, sought these documents from the Treasurer, and he refused to provide them—notwithstanding that a majority of this Senate sought those documents. That is wrong as a point of principle.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point I make is that the Treasurer forced Senator Bragg to go through the Freedom of Information Act process to get these documents. It took 18 months to get these documents which should have been provided when a majority of the Senate passed an order for these documents to be produced. Our Information Commissioner, who assesses these claims with respect to governments of both persuasions refusing to release documents, is overwhelmed because of this culture of secrecy—this culture of refusing to provide transparency not to us but through us to the Australian people. It is wrong is a matter of principle. The government are seeking to defend the indefensible; they can't do it, so they're deflecting and pivoting to all this nonsense about other issues relating to superannuation. This debate is about transparency and it is about open government. That's what it's about. Senator Bragg quoted from, in my view, one of the great warriors for freedom of information in this place, Senator Rex Patrick. I deeply acknowledge him, and probably no senator in this place has done more to promote freedom of information than Senator Rex Patrick during his time here and afterwards. I congratulate him, and I read his article as well.</span>

A point of order was taken by Senator Gallagher, which is her right, in relation to my friend's characterisation of the claim which was made by the Treasurer. I'm going to walk you through what the Treasurer said so you can see how gossamer weak it is. I won't use the word Senator Bragg used. I'll say it was a misrepresentation. I'll say it was gilding the lily. I'll say it was an incorrect assertion. I'll say it was a dodgy claim. I won't say what Senator Bragg said, but this is what the Treasurer said in his response to an order from this Senate:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's actually look at the documents. This morning I read all the documents which were disclosed by order of the Information Commissioner 18 months after they should have been disclosed. What do the documents say? This is the earth-shattering stuff which the Treasurer wanted to prevent disclosure of. I'll quote:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Please, people listening to this debate, you make a judgement as to whether or not you think this goes to the heart of private business affairs and commercial-in-confidence discussion. This is the paragraph:</span>

It is not information which relates particularly to Cbus. It is a point of general application across the superannuation industry and the property industry.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what is not in good faith is the persistent and constant attacks on our universal superannuation system by those opposite. Our superannuation system in this country is absolutely the envy of the world. It's a system that is a proud Labor legacy and it's one that we will continue to build on, despite the attacks of those opposite on our superannuation system. I've been here for long enough to remember many of the attacks that have been made on our superannuation system by those opposite. I know that Senator Rennick is no longer a member of the coalition; he's left to establish his own political party. But I do remember his time in the coalition, when he told us that Australia's universal superannuation system should just be abolished. It shouldn't exist.</span>

Of course, these are the people who absolutely need their superannuation, and these are the people that we will stand up for to make sure that they do have a dignified retirement through our super system.</span>

                    </a>  Apparently Senator Bragg doesn't want me to give a view from the hearings that we've been in—to report on the evidence that we've heard—on his super-for-housing policy, which is not a housing policy. It is actually a policy to undermine our universal superannuation system. It's not a housing policy, because every witness who's come to give evidence at our hearings on these matters has said that allowing people to take their superannuation out to pay for a home will do one thing and one thing only, and that is push house prices up. So this is not a housing policy. People who have come to our inquiry have also said that people in the target range for this policy don't even have enough super in their accounts to withdraw to be able to make a home deposit. So this is not a policy to help anyone buy a house. It is a strategy to undermine our universal superannuation system. Senator Bragg keeps pushing it as if it's about housing. It is clearly, according to all the evidence that we're seeing, only a policy for dismantling our universal superannuation system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Darmanin has explained to those opposite, in case they didn't understand, why it is so important that our superannuation system is supported and why it's so important that people retain their superannuation in their accounts throughout their 20s and 30s—despite the efforts of those opposite to dismantle superannuation—and that of course is because of the compound interest that people get by having these savings for their retirement. We're now seeing the first generation of Australians retire with enough savings through the superannuation system to have a dignified retirement and to not have to rely on the age pension—to actually have ambition that is greater than relying on the age pension.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that those opposite will always attack our universal superannuation system. It's a proud Labor legacy. It's one that we're determined to build on, and we are building on it in this term of government. We are building on it by expanding paid parental leave and also paying superannuation on paid parental leave, a policy that will boost the superannuation savings of women. We believe in our universal superannuation system. Those opposite only believe in tearing it down.</span>

Just so the Australian people realise the smokescreen that's going on here this morning, which is absolutely disgusting in itself, this is not about super and it's not about housing. This is about being honest with the Australian people and about integrity. It's about integrity and transparency. That is what this is about this morning.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This issue is about a minister that was called to the chamber to explain why Senator Bragg was refused access to information he sought using the Senate's OPD powers. This is what this is about. So forget the smokescreen. The sprinklers are finished. The smoke's gone. There is no more smokescreen. That's what this is about. And yet, Mr Bragg—as Mr Bragg, not as Senator Bragg—was granted access to the same information under FOI. This is what this is about, because this should have been made transparent and it wasn't, and good on Senator Bragg for drawing this issue to the Senate's attention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All senators should be worried about what has happened here—all of you. While our primary role is to review and pass laws, it is also our job to hold the government of the day to account on behalf of the people out there. We sit here on behalf of citizens in all states, and it is our duty to make sure the government is performing its job efficiently, effectively, with transparency and with integrity. That's all we ask in the best interests of the people outside this chamber. But we can't do that without access to information. The Labor Party went to the last election—you remember, you voters for the Labor Party—on a promise of greater transparency. Have a good look, Australians. How has that been going for over two years? Has there been greater transparency? I don't think so. That was extremely misleading, and you wonder why those people out there don't trust us in here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's the deal. What just happened to Senator Bragg is not new to this Senate, is it? I can remember the same thing happening to former senator Rex Patrick in the last parliament. He would regularly get access to documents under FOI that he couldn't get using the Senate's powers. So this is not just a Labor thing. It's not just a Labor thing, and you haven't done any better with your transparency. The Albanese government is doing exactly the same in the Senate as the Morrison government did in the 46th parliament. That's what is going on here. This is just the major party protection racket at work, and we've had enough of it. I can assure you that when they get elected, all they do is wrap a secrecy cloak around themselves. That's what they do up here, and that's not what we're here for. It's just a continual Groundhog Day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the numbers to change the way that things work—for example, to adopt the process used in the New South Wales Legislative Council which involves the use of an independent arbiter when there is a disagreement between the executive and the Legislative Council. This process was actually considered by the Legal and Constitutional Committee in 2013-14, after Senator Cash refused to provide documents to the Senate in response to an OPD. The committee referred the matter to the Procedure Committee, which came to the conclusion based on a submission by then Leader of the Government in the Senate Senator Abetz—of all people—not to adopt the New South Wales practice. He also didn't want to be transparent. He said in his submission: 'An arbitration process can succeed only if it is mutually accepted by all parties and only if it includes making the disputed information available to the arbiter. Absent these two preconditions and it is unenforceable in practice.' There you have it. Even though we have the numbers today to introduce a better system to allow us to perform our constitutional functions properly in here, we won't get a better system until the major parties both agree, and this isn't going to happen because both major parties consider themselves parties of government. Neither of them wants government to be held to account properly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what's going on in this place, and you wonder why your votes are getting fewer and people do not trust you. You promised this in the last election. The Labor Party promised to be more transparent, and you have failed miserably. Let's be honest, you have failed miserably. In the meantime, Senator Bragg will just have to put up with the government advancing not proper public interest immunities but dodgy political interest immunities because that's all that's going on in here today. Just so the Australian people realise, we could change this. We could do this today. We could use the New South Wales way, but, no, both the major parties in here don't want to mention that. I wonder if I brought that bill up here, I could get it done just like that. Maybe that's a way to put both in a corner, because, quite frankly, it's all about transparency.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CASH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:43</span>):  That's exactly what this motion is about; it's actually about transparency. This is a government that, when they were in opposition, loved to lecture the then government on transparency and loved to tell the Australian people that, if they were given the privilege of governing this country, there would be a new level of transparency in Australia. The Australian people, quite frankly, need to understand that there is a whole new level of transparency in this country, but it is now known as 'secrecy'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think that there has been any time in Australia's history where a government has literally run a closed shop when it comes to democracy. Democracy is about robust debate. Democracy is about answering to the Australian people. It does not matter what portfolio you talk about, this is a government that runs a closed shop. In fact, it has been put to me time and time again, both the Australian Senate and the House of Representatives may as well now be shop floors. In other words, you close down debate, you silence people because that's the way the Albanese government runs Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stakeholder after stakeholder after stakeholder across portfolio and portfolio and portfolio have to sign, under this government, non-disclosure agreements. Again, the Australian people had better start to understand what a non-disclosure agreement is. It means that, if you are going to consult with this government on something that affects you, you either sign a non-disclosure agreement and shut up—in other words, you don't get to breathe a word of it, let alone raise any criticisms—or you don't sign a non-disclosure agreement, and guess what happens to you then? You are blacklisted and you are shown the door. Again, the Australian people had better start to wake up and understand democracy is being eroded by the Albanese government, and today's motion is just another example.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's put it into context. It's a motion in relation to Cbus. It's a motion in relation to the production of some documents. It's a motion in relation to the failure of the Treasurer of Australia to respond to an order of the Senate. It's a motion that responds to the fact that Senator Bragg, 18 months later, was actually able to get these documents through the freedom of information process—not run by the Albanese government. But let's put it into context, because you've got a protection racket being run here by the Treasurer of Australia and the Albanese government. Cbus chairman is former Labor Treasurer of Australia Wayne Swan—wow! You have to be kidding me! If that doesn't say 'protection racket' under the Albanese government, quite frankly I no longer know what does. Cbus chairman, Wayne Swan, 'paid the CFMEU $1.25 million in the 2022-23 financial year'. Don't take that from me, as it's:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… according to disclosures super funds were recently forced to make for the first time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, the Australian people need to understand that in the two-and-a-bit years that Mr Albanese has been in government—to say that they have been hoodwinked, to say that they have had the wool pulled over their eyes is an understatement. I've got no problem with the Labor Party and the Greens having the numbers in this place. That's life. But what I do have a problem with is this: the secrecy; the lack of transparency; the lack of accountability; the silencing of stakeholders by making them sign non-disclosure agreements, telling them they cannot breathe a word of criticism against this government and, if they do, they are silenced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stakeholders make representations on behalf of the Australian people, and this motion is another example of how democracy is being eroded in this country. The Australian people, quite frankly, are being silenced and they don't even know it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  Following on from Senator Cash, this chamber exists for one reason only. It is the house of review. And when it is a house of review it means it holds the government to account. We have a government in this country who are becoming a byword for secrecy, for lack of transparency and for lack of accountability. This is a government who, before the last election, promised to be the most transparent ever, to be the most accountable ever. But actually this government is going to go down as the least transparent government, the least accountable government and the most secretive government ever since Federation in 1901.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion here, moved by Senator Bragg, is actually not a controversial motion. It's just this Senate setting out its rights in relation to the production of documents. This is what this chamber exists for. This chamber has said, 'We want these documents in the interests of the taxpayers and the people of Australia.' And what did this Labor Party government do? They went: 'No, you cannot have these documents. You cannot have this information.' Senator Bragg, through various means, was able to get those documents and to show the connection between Cbus, the CFMEU and the Labor Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what it comes down to. This government doesn't want you to know what is going on, because there is a massive conflict of interest not just in relation to policy on the housing issue in Australia at the moment but also in terms of how money is laundered through the CFMEU to Cbus, back to the CFMEU and to the Labor Party. Senator Cash mentioned then the $1.25 million of members' money from the Cbus super fund that went to the CFMEU. Then the CFMEU donated $6.2 million to the Labor Party. The Labor Party, by the way, has not returned this money. The Labor Party is quite happy to keep the $6.2 million of CFMEU members' donations. Despite the Labor Party's protestations about how bad the CFMEU suddenly is, they're very happy to take the money. There is conflict of interest. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Who is the National President of the Labor Party? It is Wayne Swan, the world's worst treasurer. Who is the current Treasurer? It's Dr Jim Chalmers. He's not a medical doctor, so, if you've got a headache, don't go and see him; you'll get a worse headache, because he'll talk to you! This guy did his PhD on Paul Keating, another contender for the position of 'world's worst treasurer'. We've got the National President of the Labor Party, who is also the head of the Cbus super union, connected up with Jim Chalmers, who, by the way, used to be the chief of staff to Wayne Swan.</span>

                    </a>  Sorry. Dr Chalmers is Australia's runner-up for the position of 'world's worst treasurer'. In the middle of this Venn diagram is the CFMEU, with all the tentacles going out to Keating, Wayne Swan or the Labor Party, because we all know what the Labor Party is; we're just talking about the price of them. They will do anything for their masters in the union movement.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This comes back to the motion before us today, which includes covering up. The Labor Party position on the documents Senator Bragg requested is a political scandal. It is a disgrace that the Labor Party did not want these documents released. The question I put to everybody is: what else are they hiding? We don't know what they're hiding, but guess what? We'll find out. We'll make lots of orders for the production of documents and find out what other stinking, rotten deals are being done between the Labor Party, Cbus, the CFMEU and their acolytes in the Greens. How the Labor Party is treating the taxpayers of Australia is a disgrace. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  I thank my colleague Senator Bragg for bringing this to our attention. I too will speak about the transparency and integrity issues in relation to this. But I want to draw the chamber's attention to the fact that we have a school group upstairs watching this at the moment. It drew me to the website of the Parliamentary Education Office, where it talks about the role of the Senate. I'll read briefly; it will only take a moment. 'In the Senate, the work of the government is scrutinised.' That means 'closely examined'. I think that's something really important for us to think about in relation to Senator Bragg's order for the production of documents. If we can't have an environment where we can seek information in this place so that we can understand and ask questions, then we have a serious problem in our democracy. That is why we are here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go over some interesting facts; they've been spoken about, but I want to run through them. Cbus has some 920,000 members and manages $94 billion that belongs to those members. For 18 months, the Treasurer, Jim Chalmers, and Cbus have been trying to keep secret the information that Senator Bragg has been seeking. Former Treasurer Wayne Swan is the chair of Cbus. The disgraced CFMEU owns 21 per cent of Cbus—we're getting some dots to connect—and don't forget that Wayne Swan is also the Labor Party president and was Treasurer Chalmers's former boss and mentor. Together, they have worked very, very hard to keep this information out of the public eye, and we have to ask ourselves why that is the case. But even more importantly, they claimed that it was commercial-in-confidence and that there was an important reason that the Senate couldn't know—because the information was private to Cbus—rather than being transparent with the Australian public and with Cbus's 920,000 members. Why? What didn't they want us and Senator Bragg to know? It was that Cbus wanted special treatment, to not be transparent in their fees and costs disclosures to their 920,000 members or to anyone else who wanted to be a member.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What comes next? Wayne Swan has publicly committed $500 million of Cbus funds to co-invest in the HAFF. Should taxpayer funds be put at risk by co-investment with an organisation that is 21 per cent owned by the CFMEU? That's an important question that we need to address here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last thing that I want to point to is the cost of building in this country during a housing and rental crisis. The CFMEU has made housing more unaffordable by imposing an effective 30 per cent tax on apartment buildings. They are the last people who should be helping this government with housing—or any government, for that matter. The Australian people expect that we will protect their funds and hold this government accountable. That is why we are here. This government promised transparency and integrity, and they have broken that promise. They should be held to account for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish by responding to a couple of comments from the other side, particularly as they relate to what women want and the protection of women's superannuation. I acknowledge that the largest growing cohort of homeless in this country is women over 55, and that is shameful. I have this question: why is a woman in her 50s not allowed to access her own money—her own super—to purchase a home to have stability in her housing, but once she reaches retirement age she can spend that super to pay rent to somebody else? Can somebody explain that to me? You can't use your own money to invest in your own home, but, when the time comes, you can pay it out to a corporate or institutional landlord and be beholden to them. That is shameful.</span>

Labor responds, first of all, to Senator Bragg by hiding behind the gender argument. What that's got to do with this is beyond us. Then Senator Walsh cloaks it as an attack from the coalition on super. How is making sure that we have probity on superannuation funds an attack on super? It's protecting superannuation. Senator Bragg is just doing his job, as am I as a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia. We need questions answered. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party's defence this morning has not focused on Senator Bragg's comments; it has focused on furphies and distractions, which are condemning the Labor Party. I've had the comedy of watching Senator Ayres respond twice in the last two weeks of sittings in this Senate—10 minutes each time of just nonsense, misrepresentations and labels. Labels are the refuge of the ignorant, the incompetent, the stupid, the dishonest and the fearful—no response based on fact. Instead we have distortions and labels. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To recall what Senator Bragg talked about, he wanted to know why the Treasurer told the Senate mistruths and false statements. That's it. My question now is: why is the Labor Party trying to dodge and divert from that? We have a document from Cbus to the Treasurer. Cbus objected. Is Cbus running the country? They're claiming commercial in confidence for not giving Senator Bragg the documents, while giving Mr Bragg the documents. What are they hiding by hiding behind commercial in confidence? It's taken 18 months to get documents in this house of review—18 months. He had to use alternative channels as well. Labor's behaviour in response to Senator Bragg is now rising to one of contempt—holding the Senate in contempt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the way Cbus treats its members—hiding. This is the way this government treats the people of Australia—hiding. The government is protecting the CFMEU and Cbus. The government is doing more than just protecting it on superannuation. The government is protecting the CFMEU in Australia's biggest wage theft case. The Senate has instructed the workplace relations minister to do an investigation into wage theft involving thousands of miners from Central Queensland and the Hunter Valley, up to a $211,000 claim from one person. It's over a billion dollars in total, we believe, with miners being owed on average up to $41,000 per year of work. The Labor Party are burying it, hiding it, not doing what the Senate is telling them. Then we've got CFMEU directors involved in Coal Mines Insurance, Coal Services and coal long service leave, and they're all protecting each other and protecting the CFMEU.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My position on super, just so the Labor Party is clear, is that I believe people should have a choice—to access their money or to have it in a super fund that is also of their choice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My last point is that I proposed a fair way of adjudicating these matters of withholding documents due to commercial in confidence and public indemnity. That has been rejected. That is still available. I also make the point that the Labor Party, as I disclosed last night, has almost a million dollars in donations for the last election from big pharma, and it is hiding, under the cloak of commercial in confidence, the contracts from the people who paid $18 billion for COVID injections. That's what we want. It's hiding tens of thousands of homicides. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Confidence in Labor is plummeting. Support for Labor is plummeting. The truth has vanished, and that's the reason you're losing the confidence and support of the Australian people.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="266499" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUME</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:04</span>):  There's something really rotten going on here. But I think it's really important, before we begin the discussion about what rotten things are going on, to reflect on the many very good people that work in superannuation and the many very good people that are members of superannuation funds. Indeed, I've had a lot to do with Cbus and other superannuation funds over my time here and before I came to this place, and there is good work being done out there to make sure that Australians have a chance at a better retirement. This is not a discussion about those people. It is not a discussion about the people that work for Cbus either—and there are many good people who do that. But they should know what is going on here because there is this weird, cosy, uncomfortable and inappropriate relationship that is clearly going on between the highest echelons of Cbus and the Labor government. Our concern is that the Labor government is more concerned about what's important to Cbus—and indeed, more importantly, to the unions associated with Cbus, particularly the CFMEU—than it is with what is important and what matters to ordinary Australians that rely on both the government, and its integrity, and organisations that its money is invested in, like industry superannuation, like any superannuation fund, like Cbus, to behave to the highest possible standards, and that's not what's happened here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are plenty of opportunities that the Treasurer has had to address those issues that are important to ordinary Australians. Inflation is running out of control, economic growth is stagnating in this country and productivity is going backwards, yet he seems to spend an inordinate amount of time in cahoots with his former boss—who is also the chair of Cbus—and making false claims to this chamber in the process. That is uncomfortable, and it should be uncomfortable, and it should be called out by this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in March 2023 my colleague Senator Bragg did something pretty basic, something that pretty much all of us have done at some stage; he sent a freedom-of-information request to the Treasurer requesting all communications between Cbus Super—and let's remember that Cbus Super's chair is Wayne Swan, the former Treasurer of the country and the former boss of the current Treasurer. He requested all communications with Cbus since the last federal election. Six months later Senator Bragg finally received those documents, but they were heavily redacted as to make them unintelligible. They included a redacted email sent by Cbus to the Treasurer's office on 24 November 2022, just a few days before the Cbus chair, Wayne Swan, publicly committed half a billion dollars of superannuation members' money for involvement with Labor's proposed Housing Australia Future Fund. That commitment came before any exposure draft legislation on the HAFF had been released by the Treasury.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 17 October 2023 the Senate agreed to an order for the production of documents requiring the Treasurer to release those documents unredacted, but on 6 November the same year the Treasurer, via the minister here, responded to that order by claiming public interest immunity over the documents. In that claim the Treasurer said that the disclosure of certain information relating to Cbus Super would be contrary to the public interest because it would disclose commercial-in-confidence information. In the Treasurer's letter to the Senate, he said that disclosure would provide an unfair insight into Cbus's private opinions and that that would have the potential to damage their commercial affairs. Well, we know that that was not commercial-in-confidence information and that that PII claim was falsely made. PII claims are not made lightly in this place; in fact, we all need to take them very seriously because if we don't take them seriously we debase the work that we all do—not just the current government, not just the current Treasurer, but all of us. This has been made a mockery of by the Information Commissioner. You have been found, on this one, to be not wearing trunks when the tide has gone out, Labor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the Treasurer going to do about this? We want him to, via his minister, make an explanation to the Senate as to exactly why he would make a false public interest immunity claim, debase the work of the Senate and debase us all.</span>

                    <a href="266499" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUME</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  I rise to speak on the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 and the Future Made in Australia (Omnibus Amendments No. 1) Bill 2024. These bills seek to retrofit some form of a principle based framework to the government's hodgepodge of announcements that it has rolled together in its Future Made in Australia agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will oppose these bills, and we encourage all of those in this chamber to oppose them, because, the more we learn about Labor's Future Made in Australia plan, the more clearly we see that the emperor has no clothes on at all. The more we learn about Labor's Future Made in Australia, the more obvious it is that there is no new paradigm, no new economic orthodoxy, as the Treasurer is so fond of claiming and, indeed, penning 6,000-word essays about. No, there is just the same old Labor with the same old industry policy, picking winners, ideologically driven priorities and wrongheaded subsidies, all at the expense of the taxpayer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It could not be clearer that this does not stack up. It's a plan for pork-barrelling; it's not a plan for building a strong economy. It's a plan that would lead to more government intervention, not more business investment. Worst of all, it's a plan for more inflation at a time when Australian families and businesses are already struggling under the weight of the Labor government's economic mismanagement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a proud and strong manufacturing history and a proud and strong manufacturing industry, and, while for decades the coalition has been a champion of this vital sector by supporting manufacturing, it requires far more than simply empty slogans to keep it going. It requires effective economic management, a management style that gets back to basics: affordable and reliable energy, flexible workplace practices that work for both the employee and the employer, less regulation and red tape and green tape, and an incentive based tax system that rewards risk and provides an incentive for people's efforts. These are the pillars of a successful economy, pillars that Labor policies are steadily eroding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's make it clear: the Future Made in Australia Bill is not about securing our future; it's about securing Labor's political interests. Labor is using this bill as a vehicle for pork-barrelling, handing out taxpayer money to favoured sectors without any proper scrutiny. It's not the way to build a strong and resilient economy. Labor's plan fundamentally misunderstands what it is that drives business investment. It's not more government grants and handouts that Australian businesses need, and it's certainly not what they're crying out for. What they need is less red tape, less green tape, less regulation, lower taxes and a regulatory environment that encourages growth and innovation but doesn't stymie it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, these bills dramatically increase the ability for the government to essentially funnel taxpayer money through the Export Finance Australia organisation and ARENA, transforming them into tools for political gain rather than tools for economic development. The changes to ARENA, in particular, are alarming. ARENA was established as a research and development agency. Previously Labor opposed even expanding the remit of this organisation to cover sensible net zero and related R&amp;D expenditure initiatives, including into carbon capture and storage and blue hydrogen. Labor opposed that. But now, under this bill, ARENA's role is expanded to include deployment, manufacturing and commercialisation—areas that are so far removed from its original purpose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's changes give the minister for climate change the power to boost ARENA's funding without parliamentary oversight, allowing $3.98 billion to be spent with the stroke of a pen—$3.98 billion of taxpayer money, without scrutiny. This is nothing more than a slush fund for the minister for climate change, Mr Bowen, who will now have the power to roll out billions of dollars without any parliamentary oversight. This is the same old industry policy for the same old Labor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's see how well they're doing so far. We have $1 billion that has already been shelled out for solar panel manufacturers that even the Treasurer's own hand-picked Productivity Commissioner doesn't believe will economically stack up—$1 billion of your money. There's half a billion dollars to an American quantum computing company, and there are serious questions to answer on the process for the funding that the ANAO may inquire into. An American quantum computing company, for a Future Made in Australia: I ask you, how does that stack up?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the Solar Sunshot program, which even the Treasury secretary refuses to endorse. I think that's quite extraordinary. And the biggest booster of green hydrogen, Fortescue, are scaling back their ambitions for green hydrogen, not expanding them, despite the promise of tax credits for just existing, for just doing what they were always going to do—tax credits for 'just being'. This is the Labor government's idea of a future made in Australia. Former productivity commissioner Mr Gary Banks described the government's policy as a fool's errand that risks repeating the mistakes of the past by propping up, in his words, 'political favourites'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us consider why the Australian manufacturing industry are in this position to begin with. Labor's policy on energy, on industrial relations and on taxation are making Australia a less attractive place to do business. Insolvencies in this country have skyrocketed. Around 19,000 businesses have gone under since Labor took office. That is 19,000, just in the past 2½ years alone. And there is every indication that there is more to come. That's the highest number of insolvencies on record. Productivity is down by 6.3 per cent in the last two years, and businesses are struggling just to keep their doors open.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Future Made in Australia Bill does absolutely nothing to address these challenges. In fact, by throwing money into a flawed system, it's likely to make things worse. Inflation is already, in the words of the RBA governor, both 'home grown' and 'sticky'. Prices have risen by 10 per cent, and for working households the cost of living has surged by over 18 per cent. No wonder Australians feel that they're doing it tough; they are doing it tough. No wonder they feel that they're poorer; they are poorer, under Labor. Personal income taxes are up by 20 per cent. Real wages have collapsed by nine per cent, and household savings are down by 10 per cent. In Australia a typical family with a mortgage of around $750,000 is now $35,000 worse off a year. They have to find $35,000 more a year to pay that mortgage. That's not the sort of money you find down the back of a couch.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the facts, and they paint a very bleak picture of Labor's economic legacy. Since taking office, Labor has spent an additional $315 billion. That's over $30,000 per household in Australia. And I haven't met a family yet who's feeling $30,000 better off under this government. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer may be trying to pick winners, but the problem is that it's Australian families that will lose under this plan. Australians deserve so much better. They deserve a government that will address cost-of-living issues head on and put their needs first—not the needs of their mates and not the needs of their political favourites. They need a government that will make the tough decisions that are required to secure our nation's economic future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's plan is very clear. We will get back to basics. First, we will rein in inflationary spending. We will not spend billions of dollars on corporate welfare for green hydrogen and critical minerals. Instead we will prioritise responsible spending that delivers real benefits for Australian families and Australian businesses. Second, we will cut red tape, removing those regulatory roadblocks that are stifling innovation and suffocating our economy. We will make it easier for businesses to grow and to create jobs; we will not make it harder for them. That's what they are asking of us. Third, we will provide lower, simpler and fairer taxes for all Australians. Everyone should be able to keep more of what they earn, and we will ensure that that happens, injecting that sense of aspiration and opportunity back into our economy. We've already announced our plan to increase the instant asset write-off to $30,000, and not only will we increase it but we will make it permanent. It's a genuine productivity-enhancing policy that will benefit small businesses, which—we must all remind ourselves every single day—are the engine room of the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourth, we will deliver affordable and reliable energy by getting more gas into the system to support manufacturers and provide secure base-load power. That 24/7 power is necessary in order for our manufacturers to be viable. This will support businesses with the power that they need to thrive and will ensure that households are not burdened with the skyrocketing energy bills that we've seen over the last two years. Our plan is not about slogans, and it's not about handouts. It's about real and practical solutions that will restore confidence in our economy and rebuild Australia's competitiveness. It's not about ideology, and it's not about playing favourites and picking winners. It's about getting back to basics and getting our economy back on an even keel so that we can all prosper and thrive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the Future Made in Australia Bill is not the answer to our nation's economic challenges. It is, unfortunately, simply a misguided attempt to paper over the cracks of Labor's economic policies, and it uses taxpayer money to do it. It uses taxpayer money to fund political priorities rather than pulling the levers on those drivers of a strong economy, like energy prices and energy reliability or an industrial relations system that is flexible for employees and for employers, so that it works for all of us and not just for some of us and returns productivity to our economy. It's about reducing red tape, brown tape, green tape and every other kind of tape which this government has wrapped our economy in and which has slowed down business, stifled innovation and made people walk away from their own businesses because it's all too hard. It's about a tax system that gets productivity going and restores that sense of opportunity, so that people know that, if they work hard and take a risk, it will be worth their while.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly, it's about tackling inflation—the ultimate thief in the night that eats away at your income, erodes your savings, reduces your standard of living and, overall, reduces your quality of life. If you cannot tackle inflation, then as a government you are not doing your first job, which is to raise people's standard of living, not lower it. That's what we've seen in the last two years. Most importantly it's to address the real needs of Australian families and businesses, to improve their quality of life and make sure that they've got more money in their pockets so that they can have the choices and the opportunities that they deserve and that they expect in what should be and can be—and will be, under a coalition government—a prosperous and thriving society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition offers a much better way: a return to sound economic management, to responsible use of taxpayer money and to policies that will secure Australians' future.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:24</span>):  The Greens are approaching the Future Made in Australia legislation proposed by Labor—the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 and Future Made in Australia (Omnibus Amendments No. 1) Bill 2024—very cautiously. I'll explain in a little while why we are doing that and what some of our concerns and, to be fair, our fears are about this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to start at a high level. While we are in, as we are, an era when the ecological processes that underpin all life, including human life, on this planet are crumbling around us and collapsing and while the planet's climate is breaking down, the time for more government intervention in the economy is upon us. We have seen what laissez-faire capitalism has delivered us. We have seen what a so-called free market approach has delivered us. It has delivered us calamity and catastrophe. It has delivered us a planet that is becoming unliveable. It has delivered us an extinction crisis. It has delivered, and is delivering, us climate breakdown. That's what this hands-off, leave-it-all-to-the-markets approach has done. That is what privatisation has delivered us. That is what allowing corporations to behave in the psychopathic way that corporations do has delivered us. That is what standing back and allowing rampant corporate profiteering and price gouging is delivering us—an unliveable planet and a massive redistribution of wealth in our society away from people at the bottom and in the middle and up to the oligarchs at the top. The time for more government intervention in the economy is upon us. We have to do this. We have to understand that governments can be lenders of first resort. We have to understand that governments can nationalise companies and sectors that currently are run by the private sector but, not many decades ago, were run by governments in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's ironic that the Australian Labor Party, who obviously are now in government, are the architects of the great privatisation agenda that we've seen in the last 40 or 50 years in this country. Of course, that privatisation agenda and the wholehearted embrace of neoliberalism and corporatism started under Prime Minister Bob Hawke and Treasurer Paul Keating. Privatisation is a Labor agenda. Labor governments rarely saw an asset owned by the public—one that wasn't absolutely nailed down—as anything other than something to be sold and privatised. We support starting to move away from this privatisation agenda that's been in place since Labor brought it in 40-odd years ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support moving away from just letting markets rip—letting markets slash and burn, smashing up our society, making our society more unequal, rendering the planet uninhabitable and driving an extinction crisis. We support ending those things and moving back to the scenario where, when there was a social need for something, governments stepped in. Take, for example, housing at the moment. Governments once stepped in and built enough houses so that everyone in Australia could have a safe, affordable and accessible home. That's the way it used to be. Governments would build houses, and they would rent them out at affordable prices so people could have a safe and affordable home. It's a disgrace that, in a country as rich as Australia, we don't have enough homes for people. But that is what neoliberalism has delivered, what privatisation has delivered and what the big corporations who've got their hooks into the establishment parties in this place have delivered. The Greens support governments setting an agenda for the direction of our economy. We need an urgent transition out of fossil fuels and into renewables. Governments should be driving that agenda much more quickly than we currently are. We want governments to put in place frameworks which shape investor decisions about which productive parts of the economy we want money to flow into and which unproductive, undesirable parts of the economy we don't want money to flow into.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem that the Greens have with the government's Future Made in Australia agenda is that, even though it sounds terrific to make our future in Australia, we're not convinced it will do any of those things that I just outlined. We're not convinced about that at all. The real danger here is that, as it's been presented to this parliament, Labor's Future Made in Australia agenda is actually all about a future of coal, oil and gas well beyond 2050. Labor's Future Gas Strategy is inherently linked to Labor's Future Made in Australia framework. And that is dangerous. It is dangerous for our country, it's dangerous for everyone in the world, it's dangerous for all the species who are being driven to extinction and it's dangerous for our climate. We have very real concerns that, hidden within this nice, fluffy, warm-sounding framework, a future made in Australia is actually a dangerous future for coal, oil and gas beyond 2050.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some indicators there. I've read the Chevron submission to the Senate inquiry. I've read the INPEX submission to the Senate inquiry. They love it! And do you know why they love it? It's because they can smell public money to boost their already obscene profits. Remember, folks—about a third of the top 100 biggest corporations in Australia pay zero tax. That means that a nurse, teacher, chippie or plumber that goes to work and pays income tax is paying more tax than giant, multinational corporations that operate in Australia and then offshore their profits and avoid their tax responsibilities. One in three of the 100-biggest corporations in this country pay zero tax at all—absolutely nada. Nothing! I say to every nurse, teacher and carpenter—everyone who does an honest year's work in Australia and pays income tax—thank you for your contribution, but what a shame that so many of the big corporations are paying zero tax. Of course, they turn around and use those profits to pay multimillion-dollar salary and bonus packages to their wealthy CEOs and their senior managers. They also use some of those profits to donate to the establishment political parties in this place. And so the cycle goes on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have concerns that parliament will pass the bill potentially this or next week. We could be told, 'Now we need to use the Future Made in Australia framework to support the opening up of new gas fields so that we can make petrochemicals or fertilisers to support our economic resilience.' But I'll tell you one thing for nothing, colleagues. The physical reality—not to mention the science and the laws of thermodynamics—is telling us very clearly we need to stop opening new fossil fuel projects. We need to stop it, and we need to stop it now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where is Labor's response to that? They have a pathetically weak climate agenda that is actually seeing emissions continue to go up. They're going up, colleagues, since Labor came to power. Labor were elected to bring Australia's emissions down. That's what people believed they were going to get from the Labor Party in return for their vote. And what have we seen? It's a Labor Party that has overseen the continued increase of emissions since it came into government. In Australia currently we have the situation where companies like Santos are buying gas in the domestic market and then turning around and exporting it to fulfil international contracts that they overpromised on and now can't deliver on. I want to say very clearly to Santos and other companies in the same boat: that's not our problem. That is not the problem of the Australian taxpayer, not the problem of the Australian people and not the problem of this parliament. We should make it unlawful for companies like Santos to buy gas in the domestic market and ship it overseas just because they got greedy and they over contracted. That's Santos's problem; they can fix it. Don't start putting the pain onto Australian consumers. Greedy gas corporations are now pushing onto a meek, complicit Labor government that the government has to deal with the consequences of corporate greed and over contracting and overcommitment. Well, it's not the government's problem. The government shouldn't be bailing big corporations out of that problem.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Future Gas Strategy, which appears inherently linked to Labor's Future Made in Australia agenda, has a great big dream, a great big fantasy, underpinning it—that is, the dream and fantasy of opening up the Beetaloo basin, Scarborough and Browse, of fracking the Kimberley, Perth and Surat basins. That's the dream. That's the fantasy of the Future Gas Strategy which appears embedded in Labor's Future Made in Australia legislation. The failures of the gas export industry should have taught us an important lesson that it appears the Future Made in Australia premise has forgotten: we cannot just let multinational corporations swoop in, mine our resources, extract our resources for nothing or next to nothing, and ship the resources and the profits overseas. But here we are with a complicit, weak Labor government that appears to be contemplating doing exactly that into the future under the fluffy, warm badge of the Future Made in Australia legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want a Future Made in Australia, let's have a genuine discussion about what that means and what kind of future we want in this country. The Australian Greens support government intervention in our economy to drive public and private funds into productive parts of our economy and out of parts of our economy that are unproductive and deliver negative outcomes to our people and our environment. We support that, and it appears that Labor has accepted, in principle, that it's a good thing. But we have to have an honest discussion about what that looks like in reality—which parts of the economy we want to help, which parts of the economy we want to disadvantage and how we are going frame up a future where we can deliver on the needs of our people and ensure an inhabitable planet where the climate's not breaking down around us and ecological collapse has been averted. Those are the conversations that we need to have, and we have no certainty at all that the Labor Party is ready to have those discussions. We stand ready to enter into a good-faith negotiation with Labor on this legislation, by the way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot keep privatising the profits and socialising the losses. We saw it during COVID, when Qantas and Virgin needed bailing out. What the taxpayer supports should have done was ensure ownership and equity in those companies for the people of Australia; instead, the companies got massive cash grants. Now that they're profitable again, instead of the public getting a financial return on its investment and its bailout, the companies have just pocketed the money and continued to fleece their customers and give multimillion dollar salary and bonus packages to their CEOs. Socialising the losses while privatising the profits is a tried-and-true public policy failure. The people hate it, and rightly so. Privatisation is a tried-and-true public policy failure. The Australian people hate it, and rightly so. Let's start nationalising companies again. Let's start intervening in the market, and, instead of this hands-off, laissez-faire, disaster capitalism framework that we have now, make markets work in the interests of people and the interests of nature and climate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  Well, what a contribution! As usual, the Greens are grandstanding, doing their social media, overhyping their contribution to what is very important legislation. Australia is a lucky country for so many reasons. We are a smart country that can adapt. We are a country that embraces the future—we don't hide from it. We are culturally, geographically and resource rich in every sense. It is our people that are our greatest strength. Our mateship, our unity of purpose and our success as a multicultural country is the envy of the Western world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is always looking to the future. We are a forward-thinking government, like all great Labor governments. We plan for the worst and hope for the best. This legislation is about locking in our future prosperity as a nation. It is about creating opportunity for all to share in the great wealth of our country. This is about this generation and the next. We know that the world is changing ever so quickly. The global economic climate has changed, and we must change with it. The planet is changing from a carbon-intense planet to a cheaper, cleaner energy producer. This is the purpose. This is the biggest change in the world that we have witnessed since before the Industrial Revolution. The global world order is shifting and if we don't shift and adapt, we will be left behind and will not prosper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is an amazing continent in the Pacific and it has been dealt an amazing hand to take every opportunity presented to it, to use our natural abilities as a nation and our natural resources, which are in abundance, to make the most of the global net zero economy. We have a unique combination of geographical and meteorological advantages, and we should be seeing all of these as advantageous and using them to make sure that we provide assets and opportunities for all Australians. That's what a good, fair government would do. It would set up Australia to take advantage of and benefit from these as a nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The jobs and opportunities of clean energy transition must not be taken for granted. We know those on that side, when they were in government for 10 years, had 22 policies around energy and couldn't even deliver on one—and let's talk a little bit later about their most recent lightbulb moment. On the other hand, the Albanese government want to make sure that we have manufacturing back on our land. We're about creating a future made here in Australia. That's what our agenda is. We're in a unique situation to take advantage of this and to invest in our people. That's what we are doing in our institutions and in this wonderful continent we call Australia. A future made here will power the future and bring the manufacturing base back into our own backyard. We are engaging in investment in our future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 will help make Australia a renewable energy superpower and an indispensable part of the global net zero economy, to more closely align our national and our economic security interests. That's what this bill is going to do. We will modernise and strengthen our economy in a world built on cheaper and cleaner energy. This bill serves every Australian, not just some. It serves not just those in the cities, but those in our regions as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also ensure public investment in smart investments. It will ensure public investment that pulls in substantial private investment and guides it towards Australia's national and economic interests, like investing in green hydrogen in my home state of Tasmania, or a windfarm off the coast of Tasmania. We will educate and create the jobs of the future so every Tasmanian has a secure, well-paid job that they can rely on into the future. This bill is about a national interest framework which will help us identify sectors where we have a sustainable, comparative advantage in the net zero economy, or an economy resilient and ready to take that next secure step that we need, which is imperative going forward, and make sure that our investments are around the economy of the future, which will give us security for those people who can invest in these ventures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, it will give us a robust sector assessment process to help us better understand and break down barriers to private investment in key areas of the economy. Thirdly, there are a set of community benefit principles that will ensure public investment and that the private investment it generates not only leads to strong returns but also leads to a stronger, healthier community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Interest Framework outlines criteria to assess sectors against to ensure that we determine where Australia's national interests are so that we can unlock those opportunities to have private investment. Business must drive this investment and energy transition, and it will, because it has already started this process. We acknowledge that. Jim Chalmers and Anthony Albanese have made sure that the Future Made in Australia investment is the focus of our latest budget—on refining and processing critical minerals, producing renewable hydrogen, exploring production of green medals and low-carbon liquid fuels, supporting targeted manufacturing of clean energy technology, including solar, and value-adding in the battery supply chain. This is where Australia's future is heading, and we have to capitalise on it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what this bill will deliver. It will deliver a better economy, it will deliver more investment and it will deliver greater outcomes for both regional Australia and our cities. It delivers a smart Australia. An Australia that continues to be reliant on foreign interests to make every single consumable is not the future that we want for Australians. We will make our own solar panels and batteries to power Australian homes and businesses, because there is nothing like Australian know-how and ingenuity. Our attitude is that we can do this and we will. We want people in this chamber to get on board and support this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill empowers the government to direct Treasury to undertake independent assessments, and these assessments will be tabled in parliament to supply transparency and rigorous decision-making and help deliver value for money. If we don't invest correctly, we will waste taxpayer money, and that's not what we're about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Public investment will be an important and substantial part of our plan. Public and private investment together is what this bill is going to encourage. Private investment must be attractive to enable us to help transform our economy and our communities. This is a public and private partnership. That's what this plan is all about. The most important role for public investment will be to unlock the vast amount of private sector capital that we'll need to deploy—an additional $225 billion by 2050—to transition the energy system and realise net zero opportunities in heavy industries. The framework and the sector assessments will be instrumental here in identifying the barriers to private investment and the opportunities to address them, informed by Treasury's expert analysis and evidence based assessments on top of their own normal policy advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we know how important it is to get expert advice when you're talking about energy, unlike those opposite. That's why they couldn't deliver on the 22 energy policies they had when they were in government for 10 years. That's why their latest light-bulb thought about energy will never be delivered—because they haven't got the backing of any experts in that area whatsoever and the country would never, ever be able to afford it. This bill will also outline a series of community benefit principles, because we know that just pumping capital into transformation won't be enough if we don't pay attention to how we deploy it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our educational institutions are amongst the best in the world, which is why we have funded them—unlike those opposite, who gutted TAFE and our other institutions. Education and skills are so crucial to empowering our economy and to ensuring that we have manufacturing back in our backyard, but, also, educating and skilling up our people is investing in them—not like those opposite, with their record. We need to develop skills that are inclusive to ensure we have the workforces to be able to engage with local communities, including our First Nations communities and communities affected by the transition to net zero. We need to ensure our domestic industrial capabilities thrive if this plan is to be effective so that local supply chains will be bolstered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our $22.7 billion budget investment demonstrates our commitment to a future made here in Australia. Public investment will show us a path to a future made in Australia, but private capital will pave the way. So it's an exciting time to be in business in Australia. It will need thinkers and entrepreneurial people to invest in Australia first and businesses second. The Future Made in Australia agenda is investing in a strategy to make our growth strategy stronger and to provide investors with the clarity, certainty and cooperation that they need from government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank our business leaders for working so collaboratively with Treasurer Chalmers, Minister Bowen and Minister Husic and, of course, the Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, for his vision. He has demonstrated leadership and vision. It is a vision that supports the principles of the labour movement. It supports workers right across the country to make the best quality products right here at home in their backyard. It is time now to act. We wasted 10 years under those opposite in government. The world is changing, and, unlike those opposite, we are ready to accept the challenge of the future. The new age can be a golden age if we make the change now and decide to invest in our people and the Australian spirit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our country has suffered through a decade of denial and delay under those opposite, and, if they had their way, there would be another wasted decade ahead, going down a nuclear road to a mushroom cloud. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not make that same mistake of the past. We must be a bold country that is a smart country—a country that knows our best days are ahead of us, not behind us. We can and we will make the best products right here for domestic and international consumption. I'm backing a future made in Australia. I'm backing the Prime Minister and his leadership. I'm hoping that those in this chamber will back Australians and will back Australia's economy to be stronger in the future and to seize the opportunity to lead, not live in the past.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the Leader of the Opposition wants to take us down that nuclear road, when he has not one expert that's come out in support of it. We cannot afford to build it. We know that it's going to be decades in the making. In the meantime, they're not going to deliver any cheaper energy to households. The question is: are you supporting Australians?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="256063" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:54</span>):  I'm grateful for the opportunity to make some comments in relation to the Future Made in Australia legislation. In doing so, I want to reflect on where the country has been over these last few decades and pay credit to the Labor Party for, in the 1980s, helping the country bring down the tariff wall—remove subsidisation of industry. Sometimes these measures were supported by the Liberal Party. Not all the deregulation and other economy related measures that were required to build a robust, modern economy were supported. But in general terms, I think in the long run of history will look back at that period as a period when tough judgements were made by that government, the Hawke government. And I think most reasonable people would say it was a government that did things that others could have done but didn't do when they were given the opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures in relation to a future made in Australia are winding back the clock 40 years, maybe—maybe more—to a period when the government thought it knew better than the market did, that it could swim against the tide of global capital, that people in Canberra were so smart and so intelligent that they would just run the show from here. That is a very scary position for the country to be in, but it is perhaps not surprising. This has been a regressive parliament. I have been shocked that I've been part of parliament that wound back a tax reform of the last parliament. In this parliament the government reimposed a tax bracket that had been removed by the last parliament. And now we have a government that is seeking to establish a picking-winners approach here in Canberra, where big businesses—it could be foreign or domestic businesses—will be funded by the Commonwealth government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is an approach that has been discredited. You can go back to the 1970s and look at all the different debates that were had, by Bert Kelly and others. These issues were ventilated for decades before the Hawke government finally put the tariff wall and subsidisation to death—to their eternal credit. Now we are back in around 1975. We've got another Treasurer, another doctor Treasurer—like Jim Cairns—who thinks he can fund the economy as a venture capitalist. It's been a very regressive period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, I would say that the central charge against this government is that it has been so focused on what is important to its favourite fellow travellers—the unions, the super funds and co.—that it has had no time to resolve the major economic challenges of the day. That is why people under 40 are going crazy about housing, why the Australian dream is further and further away the longer the Labor government is in office and why the inflation problem is getting worse here compared with almost any other jurisdiction we would care to compare ourselves with. And that is the problem: the government has been so focused on the rent seekers and the bloodsuckers that it has had no time to resolve the major challenges of the day. And this bill is a continuation of this problem—that the government is trying to feather the nests of its favourite people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We did an inquiry into this bill through the Economics Legislation Committee. One of the major issues that came up in the inquiry was that the provisions of the bill provide for a form of compulsory unionisation, where grants or payments are made by these funds. In fact, when asked about the so-called community benefit principles, the AMWU said that firms receiving finance grants or equity investment in their firm should be required to have an enterprise agreement with the relevant trade unions registered or enter the relevant multi-employer bargaining stream. This whole business is all about our old mate here saying, 'How can we help the people that are closest to us?' It's not: 'How can we solve problems for the Australian people? How can we solve inflation? How can we help small business? How can we deal with housing?' No; it's: 'How can we give money to our best friends? How can we help the unions?' This is unfortunate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If I were advising the government, I would not have come into this parliament when it started back in the middle of 2022 and abolished the Australian Building and Construction Commission. I don't think that was a very good decision. I know that Senator Watt now is having to deal with that mess, and we all wish him well. But I'm not sure it was a great judgement call for the government. Sure, the longer the governments go, the more they perhaps incur integrity issues when they make bad judgements, but this is another bad judgement of trying to entrench their favourite people into this new scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minerals Council of Australia said that the workplace relations elements of the community benefit principles in section 10, paragraph (3) (a) (i) of the bill are unnecessary and would be economically damaging. The Minerals Council go on to say the principles are not about improving working conditions but are a government mandated attempt at union control of policy, judgements and workplaces. The other issue here is that this will entrench permanent rent-seeking through the picking of winners. The Productivity Commission itself said that industry policy such as Future Made in Australia can be costly for governments, act as a form of trade protection and distort the allocation of Australia's scarce resources towards activities that Australia is not best placed to undertake.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This takes me back to my central charge that we're going back in time some 40 or 50 years with this approach. The Chair of the Productivity Commission, Danielle Wood, has described the policy as risking 'forever subsidies'. She says that we risk creating a class of businesses that is reliant on government subsidies, and it can be a very effective way of getting them to come back for more. The Productivity Commission is saying what it has always said: this idea of subsidising industry is very dangerous for the economy. I guess they must regret that we are now back in the 1970s and having the same lengthy debates that were won then.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former chair of the Productivity Commission, Gary Banks, has said that the Future Made in Australia is a fool's errand which risks making the mistakes of the past by propping up so-called political favourites. He was described as a flat-earther by the Prime Minister. Apparently, if you're an economist setting out that there are orthodox things that have been determined over many decades, such as the risk of government subsidising industry forever, you're now a flat-earther. I wonder whether there is a point when government thinks, 'Maybe we actually should try and focus on what will be good for the people of Australia rather than just people who are close to us.' That is really the major issue with Future Made in Australia. It's all about entrenching union control over workplaces, as set out in these community benefit principles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the ACTU come to the hearings. I was able to ask Ms O'Neil, the President of the ACTU, about these community benefit principles. She gave—I would have to say—an answer which was very unclear. We then asked the AMWU and AWU what their views were, and they gave a very clear answer, saying they thought it was very important that any organisation that wanted to receive these funds, grants or subsidies should have a mandatory unionisation policy. At least they were honest. I went on to congratulate the AWU for being honest, because at least they were saying what this is all about. It's all about entrenching control amongst a small group of people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is before you even consider the idea of crony capitalism. I would say this is about crony unionisation. The industry minister, Ed Husic, thinks he's going to be a venture capitalist. He will go around and invest in a whole lot of different businesses in Australia and, obviously, abroad. We've seen the billion-dollar bet he's made on PsiQuantum, which is not an Australian company. He will do that. In the process of doing so, he is going to commit our taxpayer funds in circumstances where there must be a union involved. So this is going to be another opportunity to enrich their favourite vested interests. Ultimately, all their chickens will come home to roost, because, after 2½ long years of Labor, the Australian people will be wise to their economic circumstances, being much poorer than they were back in May 2022. Regrettably, I've got to say that issues like housing for the under-40s are going to get worse before they get better if this government were to stay in office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think people generally want their governments to do well, but they will be very sceptical of efforts to give special deals and handouts to a select few union tsars, which is what we've seen out of this government. It was only last week that we discovered that the Treasurer, Jim Chalmers, had decided that he would use his position to file a false public interest immunity claim here in the Senate when the Senate had sought an order for the production of documents to get access to files that were provided by one of his favourite vested interests, the Cbus super fund, which is chaired by his former boss, Mr Wayne Swan, who is also the president of the Labor Party. The story gets better and better, doesn't it? Dr Chalmers used his position to file a false public interest immunity claim to stop the Senate getting access to the document.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are lucky that as citizens we have access to freedom of information laws, because, under the FOI laws, we can appeal a judgement. We were able to appeal to the Information Commissioner, who provided us with the document that Dr Chalmers had sought to cover up. The document was an effort to lobby by the Cbus super fund to get a special deal so that it could cover up its stamp duty costs from members. It wanted to conceal transparent information from members. Why would the Treasurer use his position to conceal this information from the Australian people? The answer is that it is a government for vested interests, and they were embarrassed about this idea of being exposed. It shows it is completely on brand—that when you get out of bed, you think about the 10 things you could do for your best friends today and how you can use your public office to help your best friends, not the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The consequence of all these funds that Labor have set up will be bad for the Australian people, because the off-balance-sheet items of the reconstruction fund, the housing fund and all the other funds they've set up will all be disastrous legacies for the Australian people. They will also have a very dangerous legacy for the government in the short term, because, ultimately, when you stack up these funds and put all your mates onto their boards and they end up doing dodgy things, it becomes an integrity issue. So it is a very good lesson for future governments of what not to do. You would not come into government and spend all your time and capital establishing these off-balance-sheet items, which then go away and make these judgements, and put your mates onto the boards. It's very dangerous because it will only highlight more and more integrity issues like the one we've been discussing this morning to do with Mr Swan and Mr Chalmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, the parliament may enact a form of this Future Made in Australia bill. If it does, it will entrench a funding source which will be available for rent seekers, and, as the committee process showed, everyone wants to get access to these moneys—the chocolate makers, the dog companies, the caravan companies, the desk companies, the lampshade companies, the flag makers and the camera makers. Everyone with a business in Australia applied to this committee to get access to these funds. To be honest with you, I understand this, but that highlights how dangerous this idea is. It will open the door to the rent seekers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You won't be able to drive from Sydney to Canberra anymore because it will be logjammed with people trying to come from Sydney. I imagine the Barton Highway will be clogged up with people coming from Melbourne to put their hand out to get some taxpayer funds. I guess they are acting rationally, but it is a very dangerous idea that people in Canberra will dish out funds to their mates. But I again caution the government. These ideas may be attractive to them as a way of helping them with and paying off their favourite vested interests, but I believe that they only expose the government to more integrity risks, because, ultimately, the funds will be spent poorly or badly or there'll be cover-ups.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:09</span>):  I'm very, very proud to stand here in the Senate today and speak on the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 and the Future Made in Australia (Omnibus Amendments No. 1) Bill 2024. Manufacturing, the making of things, here in Australia is an incredibly important industry for Queensland, particularly for regional Queensland, and I know that we have a really important choice to make in this country and in this chamber. We can choose a future made here in Australia, we can choose a future economy that transitions to net zero, we can choose a future economy that has more local and regional jobs or, as those opposite are choosing, we can vote down this legislation and say no to more manufacturing jobs, no to more local jobs and no to making more things here in Australia. That is the very clear choice that we have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Manufacturing is incredibly important not only to me personally but also to the community that I call home. I'm the daughter of a manufacturing worker and I'm very proud of that legacy. When I hear people like Senator Bragg call manufacturing workers 'rent seekers', it really goes to show the respect that those opposite refuse to give to people who have worked hard their whole lives to make things here in Australia and to make more local jobs for more regional communities. I want to stand here and separate myself from those types of comments because I think that manufacturing workers are wonderful people. They work incredibly hard and they support our regional communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Manufacturing is incredibly important for Cairns, the community I call home. We have a thriving defence and marine manufacturing industry. Many people would see Cairns and think that it's a tourism town—and, of course, we're very proud of our reef tourism—but under this government we are developing an incredibly strong industrial base in Cairns. Through the support of the Cairns Marine Precinct we will have more defence manufacturing and more marine manufacturing right there in Cairns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what this is all about. It's about supporting regional communities. It's about diversifying those regional communities so they have more local jobs to rely on when we go through things like the COVID pandemic, which meant that our tourism industry had to be put on hold. Our communities throughout regional Queensland rely on manufacturing, whether it's rail manufacturing or sugar manufacturing. These are good jobs, and they're secure jobs because they are on unionised worksites. That's a good thing, because these people are paid good wages. They have good, secure jobs and they support their local community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this bill does is set in place a plan for this country to make more things here at home. We need to bring manufacturing back home to Australia, and we need to bring manufacturing back home to regional Australia. When we had nine years of a Liberal-National government, we saw manufacturing slide and we became more dependent on economies outside of Australia. When COVID hit, we were one of the lowest for sustainability and self-sufficiency in the OECD. We want to increase that, we want to build back up again and we want to do that as a renewable energy superpower, because we know that that is what the world is looking for from us. We have the opportunity, the capacity, the skills, the workers and the knowledge. In a regional town like Cairns, we deserve an opportunity to compete with the rest of the world, and that's what this bill does. That's why we're supporting a future made in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's extraordinary that the LNP voted against this bill in the House. It's extraordinary that the LNP will vote against this bill in the Senate. Shame on them for not supporting manufacturing workers. The Labor Party will always back making more things here in Australia. We support manufacturing and manufacturing workers because we know that they deliver good, secure jobs and that they will continue to do that into the future if given the right supports. It's an incredibly important bill and I look forward to continuing my remarks.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  I was fortunate enough to recently visit the Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre, the Wicking centre, which is part of the University of Tasmania. The Wicking centre, founded in 2008, is state of the art and is leading the way in dementia research. Not only are we Tasmanians in a fantastic position to be leading the way in dementia research but we are also very fortunate to have this research centre as part of our own University of Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wicking centre has developed an innovative and comprehensive model. The ISLAND Clinic is nation leading in providing diagnoses for cognitive impairment. The Wicking centre has strong links to organisations such as Dementia Australia for the provision of diagnostic care, as well as the national network of clinics across Australia affiliated with the Australian Dementia Network.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ISLAND Clinic offers an improved person centred model underpinned by an interdisciplinary approach, evidence based best practice and translational research opportunities. These are now happening at the University of Tasmania through the dementia research that's happening at the Wicking centre. The ISLAND Clinic represents a model that, as I said, has international interests. It not only provides a one-stop shop for achieving a diagnosis but will also bring access to the latest clinical 1 trials, therapeutic drugs and new diagnosis technologies to help the health of the Tasmanian community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To access the ISLAND Clinic, a referral is required from your GP services, and then you can attend the clinic. You are bulk-billed and there are no out-of-pocket costs passed on to the patient. The clinic is committed to providing timely assessment and diagnosis of cognitive impairment which may or may not be a dementia diagnosis, and an ongoing management plan will be provided to your GP who made that referral in the first place. Anyone who has an interest in dementia research will know that the sooner you are diagnosed, the better that journey is going to be for you and for your loved ones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ISLAND Clinic also connects patients with organisations that provide post-diagnostic support such as Dementia Australia. As I mentioned earlier, patients are invited to consent to research related to their issues, helping ISLAND have a better understanding of cognitive issues, as well as dementia. It's so important to have this cohort participating in this very meaningful research, informed by patient experience. That is invaluable for researchers in their work, but also for GPs and the medical fraternity to have a better understanding of dementia and other such issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many clinic attendees become part of the broader ISLAND project which stands for Island Study Linking Ageing and Neurodegenerative Diseases. It's a distinctive public health initiative which aims to reduce the number of cases and the impact of cases of dementia. ISLAND involves informing and empowering the Tasmanian community to self-manage known risk factors for dementia, which can be prevented, and to make positive changes to the community's health and wellbeing that will reduce the incidence and impact of dementia over time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 14,000 Tasmanians over the age of 50 from across our state have signed up to be part of this program, and the Wicking centre's recent publication has demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach. The Wicking centre is interested in involving Tasmanians as much as possible in this project to help prevent incidences of dementia in the first place and to reduce the impact of dementia once a diagnosis is made. The vision of the ISLAND Clinic is to provide Tasmanians with equitable access to a timely and good standard of assessment, leading to an earlier diagnosis, which increases opportunities to support and manage the condition, enabling comprehensive care and better treatments for dementia in the patient, but also to give added support to their family and carers and to the broader Tasmanian community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ISLAND Clinic is linked to the National Dementia Action Plan, which is due to be released this year and has the goal of improving the experience of people with dementia and their carers with a focus of diagnosis and post-diagnostic care, the development of a related workforce and support for carers. The ISLAND Clinic is a member of, and a pilot site for, the National Collaborative Dementia Centre project that is being led by Dementia Australia and serves as an example of a clinic model that could be extended nationally and even internationally. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NCDCs are modelled on comprehensive clinic settings for other conditions—for instance, cancer—where people can receive a timely diagnosis but are also supported in post-diagnostic care and service coordination with the added benefits of access to personalised clinical trials and the support and training of the related workforce. Recently, the ISLAND Clinic was approached by the New South Wales and Queensland health sectors to discuss a potential replication of the ISLAND model in those states and to encourage it being rolled out. That is fantastic and a real 'hats off' to all the work that's being done down there in Hobart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ISLAND Clinic has also been identified as having a potential relationship to the National Dementia Action Plan to improve the state's capacity to enhance dementia care under the long-term plan for health care in Tasmania. What we probably need most in Tasmania around health is a new government, frankly. Tasmania's population, as most people would be aware, is a fast-ageing population. The Tasmanian median age is 42 and the national median is just 38. Our state has the highest rate of dementia in Australia and the highest rate of known risk factors leading to cognitive and memory issues later in life. Tasmania's ageing population does not help reduce these figures. Despite significant risks for dementia, many Tasmanians have only patchy access to services, and diagnosis and care planning remain a challenge. Dementia diagnosis is frequently only made when the disease has advanced and is related to other health conditions, which makes early diagnosis so much more critical. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We already know that our healthcare system in Tasmania is stretched to the limit. There is so much pressure on acute hospitals around the state and we don't want to see a continuation of the situation where, on average, someone with dementia will end up in an acute hospital, taking one of those critical beds for 15.9 days, compared to other treatments, where you stay for just 2.7 days. The lack of diagnosis of dementia is associated with the increased risk of hospital admissions as well as increased length of stay. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give a big-shout out to those people doing this really important work and research and to Professor James Vickers for his leadership in managing the centre. The collaboration that's taking place with GPs, who have now got a clinic to refer patients to for an earlier diagnosis, is fantastic, but what they need is funding to ensure that this clinic can continue, because the demand for those services is growing. In summary, and in reiterating how crucial the Wicking Centre and ISLAND Clinic are to Tasmania and the nation, I will be calling on my government to help them.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:25</span>):  The Help to Buy scheme is one of the Labor government's central housing policies, and we have seen this week the new Minister for Housing talk about Help to Buy as one of the centrepieces of their offering going forward. I want to bring the chamber's attention to the fact that on 1 May 2022, during the last election campaign, the Albanese opposition, as it was then, put forward the Help to Buy concept as something that it would take to the election, and, if it won the election, it would seek to legislate Help to Buy. Mr Albanese said at the time:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">After nine long years in Government, housing affordability has only got worse under the Liberal-National Government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it's much worse now, but the point here is that the Help to Buy scheme, after 2½ years of this government, has not even been put to a vote here in this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is very curious and unreasonable for the housing minister to be going around the traps, including the AFR summit this week, talking about Help to Buy as some great white hope. This is the only policy that the Labor Party has to help first home buyers. It is very clear that, if we are to arrest the decline in first home ownership amongst millennials and gen Zs, the Commonwealth government needs to tilt the scales in favour of first home buyers. This one policy, which is now 2½ years old and yet to be legislated, is apparently the Labor Party's only idea to help first home buyers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue with Help to Buy is that it is a tiny scheme of 10,000 spaces when the country needs to build more like 200,000 houses a year. It is a tiny scheme. It is a pimple on an elephant's bottom, and it is not going to be a serious policy to help Australians get into their first home. It has also been described as a distraction by people like Peter Tulip from the Centre for Independent Studies. The caps are far too low. In recent months, we've seen articles state things like, 'Median-price dwellings are out of reach in every capital city except Melbourne under Labor's Help to Buy scheme,' and that's because Help to Buy, in a place like Sydney, caps out at $950,000, whereas the median house price is $1.4 million. In Brisbane, the cap is $700,000, and the median house price is $920,000. So it is a tiny scheme which has been a distraction and would not be fit for purpose anyway because the caps are so low.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a cruel position for the government to take that this is the only offering that they have. I wonder why the government hasn't wanted to bring this on for a vote. We've had a committee inquiry into the bill. We have exercised our right in opposition to explain our problems with the bill. We think it's a bad idea. It is, of course, also very expensive. It would cost around $5 billion to put this scheme in place. I note that other parties, like the Greens, have their own reasons for being concerned about this scheme. Maybe the government should bring it on for a vote. If this is their policy to help first home buyers, then they should bring it on for a vote, otherwise we're going to be left with this ridiculous situation where the government are going to approach the upcoming election with the same policy that they launched at the last election campaign, which they haven't bothered to bring on for a vote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wonder whether, in the Albanese government change of ministry, there has been any thought given to the policies being a problem here. Housing would be the biggest issue for under 40s, but we have a new minister with the same old policies: Help to Buy, housing targets they won't meet, the Housing Australia Future Fund which doesn't build any houses and then, the best policy of all, the policy where they give foreign fund managers a tax cut to build houses as part of their perpetual renting plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have got failures on the supply side and failures on the demand side for first home buyers, and so I wonder whether Ms O'Neil is going to consider whether there is more to doing the job than presenting new marketing. There is no question that the marketing of the Labor Party's housing policy has improved, and that can be measured by how many media interviews have been done and how many slick PowerPoint presentations have been presented to the <span style="font-style:italic;">AFR</span> property summit. But the problem is the policy, so I wonder whether the government will look closely at whether it can find a way to get supply moving or whether it will look at the demand side and look at what can be done to level the playing field for first home buyers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You never hear the government talk about how hard it is to get a loan. You never hear them talking about lending policy, banking policy. These are all things that are within the preserve of the Commonwealth government. It is true that when people in this place have discussions about housing policy, many of those levers do reside with the states and with local government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whatever approach the government takes on housing, it must be very careful that it is finely calibrated and that it is achievable. So why the government is silent on banking policy and lending policy is curious to me. Why the government is so obsessed with this corporate landlord agenda that it has as the focus of its housing policy is not curious to me. As we've canvassed at length today in the Senate, the government is so worried about protecting the interests of big super funds that it will file false public interest immunity claims with this chamber in order to protect the secret lobbying agenda of the Cbus super fund which had sought an exemption from disclosure rules so that it wouldn't have to present it's fees that it incurs when it pays stamp duty to its members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very curious, as we get to the end of this term, what the government's going to do with Help to Buy. I would hope that the government will bring it on for a debate, so we can look at the issues, and for a vote; however, I wonder whether or not the government has another plan to further help the super funds take over the housing stock of Australians. I wonder whether they will pursue their build-to-rent tax exemption—maybe that will come on for a vote?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is another one where we're very happy to argue the case that it is not in the interests of Australians to have their housing stock owned by foreign fund managers. When we had the Treasury department before the Senate committee on economics, they gave a very clear answer that the tax concession for build to rent would only be available to a foreign fund manager. It wouldn't be available to Labor's best friends in the super funds; they would have to use the Housing Australia Future Fund in order to get a leg up into the property market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The build-to-rent tax exemption, if it were legislated, would provide a leg up to BlackRock, Vanguard and a range of other fund managers. If it were legislated then I think we would be having the same debate at a future election that they're having in the US now about what can be done to curb corporate housing. The Australian people don't want to be serfs to a corporate landlord like BlackRock or Cbus. They don't want that. I think that the stats that you can see in places like Jacksonville and Atlanta—up to 25 per cent of the houses are owned by corporations, fund managers—are the future we do not want for Australia. But that is what the government has come up with. I think this is a consequence of the government only looking for policy advice from a few favourite vested interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we turn the corner for the last part of this parliament, we have an unlegislated Help to Buy scheme, which apparently is still the key demand-side policy the government have. They have no other ideas. We have an unlegislated tax cut for foreign fund managers, so they can buy corporate housing. We have the Housing Australia Future Fund, which may give access to certain super funds and may pay what has been described by Senator Gallagher as availability payments to major investors like super funds. That is the extent of the achievement after 2½ years. Housing is getting so much worse for younger people, and all the government has done in 2½ years of this parliament is legislate a housing fund, the Housing Australia Future Fund, which builds no houses but provides the avenue for major investors, big super funds, to take over the housing stock of Australia. It is a pretty ugly picture. No wonder Australians are losing confidence in this government, because under-40s, particularly, understand now that this government will never fix the housing crisis.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:35</span>):  Across my home state of New South Wales as we speak, local council elections are happening. My party, the Greens, is running some 377 council candidates and 21 mayoral candidates across 61 councils; you can tell we're not the Liberal Party!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amongst those councils, I just want to highlight a couple of councillors running for re-election. In my local patch, councillors Nicki Grieve and Matt Robertson have done extraordinary job for the Greens. I know both of them very closely and consider them friends, and I served on council with Nicki Grieve. They have been doing terrific work on Woollahra council, delivering an urban forest strategy that will see their canopy grow to some 30 per cent of cover and lead to $15 million of investment in new street trees over the next two decades. They are protecting the trees and canopy controls for pretty much all the residential land in the space and putting in place requirements so that there's actual ground for new generations of trees to grow and produce canopy. They've introduced ward meetings to enhance transparency and better communicate between councillors and residents. They've had a focus on improving footpaths, really effectively, and helping people get around. One of the things I love is that they've installed free public whale-watching binoculars on the coastal walk—so anyone can turn up and watch this extraordinary natural spectacle. Well done, councillors Grieve and Robertson.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have embedded a 10 per cent affordable housing target for new developments; we would like to do more, but the state government won't let us. They have made a Paddington urban domain plan, banned alcohol consumption before council meetings—I can't tell you how much residents want that to happen—put in place an EV charging strategy to advance the rollout of EVs across Woollahra and achieved reforms and savings for council's $2.9 million legal expenditure for bringing a bunch of those services in-house. They are great councillors up for re-election. I can't tell you how proud I am to have them on the team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Waverley council, councillors Ludovico Fabiano and Dominic WY Kanak have been doing extraordinary work as well: increasing affordable housing contributions in the Waverley Local Environment Plan and getting houses so that people's kids and people who are doing essential services can live in the area; improving Waverley Park and the kids' playground; improving and protecting that gorgeous heritage rocket ship that so many kids love; ensuring the refurbishment of the Tamarama Surf Life Saving Club; and putting in the Equal Pay for Equal Play prize money requirement for sports clubs, including those having competitions on Bondi Beach. They are constant advocates for residents' concerns and protectors of the amazing Bondi Pavilion. If you've ever seen Ludovico wandering around the streets with his dogs, Blue and Bob, you'll know how popular he is with locals. Great work. I wish them well in the election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, as we speak here, the Albanese government and the Labor government in Victoria are rolling out the red carpet for foreign weapons companies for land forces in Naarm, in Melbourne. For decades, the Liberals and Labor have been signing literally blank cheques for foreign arms dealers to siphon off billions and billions of public funds. The sums are just nuts: $45 billion to the UK's BAE Systems for the scandalous Hunter frigate program, and $365 billion—last time I checked, at least—for the US and UK war industries for these mythical AUKUS submarines. The international arms industry has found a bottomless pit of money from the major parties in this place. There are thousands of young people who see this for what it is—that their future has been sold out and mortgaged to these multinational weapons companies by the major parties. Already there have been reports that riot police shot at protesters with rubber bullets down in Melbourne. Young people protesting for a fairer and more peaceful future are being shot at by their own government. And why are the government doing that? Because they're protecting international arms dealers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Things have escalated so quickly that the Australian Democracy Network has sent an urgent representation to the Victorian Premier. The letter was signed by Amnesty, the Human Rights Law Centre and many others, and they are urgently asking the police and the Victorian government to ban the use of dangerous police weapons in policing protests and to ensure that Victoria Police complies with its obligations under the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities in policing protests. Did I mention that violence against people seeking a peaceful future is being directed by their own government to defend weapons manufacturers?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not about keeping Australians safe. It's not about defending Australia. This is about putting Australia into the US production line for US wars. That's what is at the heart of it, with AUKUS pillars I and II. Australia, under Labor and the coalition, will keep pumping out weapons to wherever the US wants us to deliver them, whether it's to Israel, Saudi Arabia or other countries who are notorious for human rights abuses. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not about making us safe. It's about making a small group of international corporations bucketloads—obscene bucketloads—of money. Members of both major parties are getting in on that, and the second they leave parliament they join up as directors or government relations advisers to these overseas weapons companies. Both the ALP and the Liberals will sit in this place and vote to funnel public funds—funds that could be used instead to benefit society, deal with climate change and build houses—to foreign weapons companies who in turn will donate crumbs of it back to the Labor Party and the coalition. They accept this kind of money as political donations. And then, whether it's as a minister or an aggressive backbencher—and there's a long list, a conga line, of Labor and coalition members—they'll use those connections they have with foreign weapons manufacturers, whether it's Thales or Boeing, to get a cushy job when they leave parliament. It's obscene. No wonder people are on the streets, protesting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're here, people are still being held in PNG, trapped in PNG, as part of Australia's disastrous offshore detention regime, and they're literally being made homeless by the Albanese government. These are people who came to Australia over a decade ago seeking safety and protection, and, instead of offering them any kind of fair process, the government disappeared them. It paid another country, a much poorer country, a country dependent upon us, to break international law on our behalf—to torture people and then abandon them. It's sick. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now those people in PNG, almost all of whom have been found to be refugees, are being told they can no longer stay in their accommodation due to the Australian government's withdrawal of any financial support for PNG or the people that they've abandoned. Labor gave people false hope earlier this year by opening up a way to provide funding to PNG for the people trapped there. That's especially cruel now. The funding hasn't happened, and they are facing homelessness, in addition to chronic poverty and illness. And it's not just the people who sought asylum all those years ago, the great majority of whom have been found to be refugees, but also their children who are being used as political pawns by Labor. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to recent research, every single refugee held in PNG is suffering from physical health conditions. They can't access medical care, and they're said to have been traumatised by their treatment by this government. Due to family separation, medical trauma and experiences of violence in detention, these people are deeply unwell. Forty per cent of the refugees in PNG suffer chronic suicidal ideation and have a history of suicide attempts. It's all part of a toxic race to the bottom between the major parties on how cruelly they can treat refugees, and it's a race where everyone loses, including our national character.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The answer to this is not hard. We're talking about 50 or 60 to 70 people, many of them kids, in PNG. The Albanese government could evacuate them from PNG to get the urgent medical care they need and then, given they're all refugees or the children of refugees, provide a pathway to permanency and protection. That's the least we could do.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0T" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:44</span>):  This afternoon I rise to support the wonderful work being done by the community of Collie towards a just transition—work supported by the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. Collie is a coal town, as is evident in its name. It's been that way for a hundred years. But now that community is facing an inevitable change, and it's facing that change head-on. Coal is actually a finite resource in the town, and even if you didn't believe that climate change is real, you would see that the state has to make a decision about ending the production of coal fired energy in the state's energy grid. But, as politicians have wasted time arguing, people on the ground have deeply begun the task of creating a just transition for their community. That work began as early as back in 2007.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you jump forward to today, we have workers, businesses, community leaders and the state government working together to build a new future for the town. They were here in Canberra yesterday with state ministers Whitby and Michael, respectively the minister for energy and the minister responsible for industry. They were here to talk to the national parliament about how the Labor government's policies around Future Made in Australia intersect with their own plans. I heard directly from delegates from the Griffin coalmine and the Muja Power Station, as well as from companies who want to invest in manufacturing green steel and green magnesium, alongside other green metal industries. They're really supportive as communities, working together with industry, with government and with workers and their unions to hear how these tripartite structures, built from a bottom-up consensus basis, are absolutely critical to getting a just transition right, making sure that no-one is left behind and building the jobs for workers and their children and the future of their town.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The future of Collie looks like advanced manufacturing, green metals processing, renewable energy, big batteries and tourism. The kind of just transition we're seeing people work on there is world leading and will have lessons for the rest of the nation, who need to make this transition too. It's a transition that's getting attention from many of our major trading partners. Our Prime Minister visited the town of Collie last week and saw what's going on for himself. He is the first Prime Minister to visit there since Prime Minister Hawke. I'm proud that, as a government, we're standing up for regional workers across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have, of course, legislated for a net zero economic authority which will see that interface between communities, industries, state governments and the Commonwealth really get these transitions moving. And move we must, because, if we're to meet our climate targets, we must really dig deep into this work now. In addition, Future Made in Australia and the legislation attached to that are designed to create the necessary investment to make these transitions possible, and our Labor government is bringing people together on a tripartite basis. Business, workers, unions, community and government are working collaboratively to make these changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to be clear to those on the opposition benches who find the idea of tripartism so awful, and I want to point out to them that industry representatives are very clear about the role of workers and unions. To quote them, 'We would not get these projects off the ground without the union.' We can get consensus and progress when we have governments, business and communities all working together and collaborating. What we have from the opposition, though, is an expensive nuclear power station.</span>

Since then, more than 200 people have been held hostage by the terrorist group Hamas, the latest horror being the six hostages brutally murdered by Hamas in Gaza just last month. The names of those six were Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alexander Lobanov, Carmel Gat, Almog Sarusi, Eden Yerushalmi and Ori Danilo. May they now rest in peace and may their murderers rest in hell forever and ever.</span>

Queensland was once the Sunshine State, but now it is the state where dreams go to die because we have a state Labor government who are more interested in their own re-election and their own power plays to determine who will sit on ministerial leather, rather than in fixing the cost-of-living crisis, the housing crisis, the health crisis or the crime crisis. It is only 45 days until the state election in Queensland. It's 33 days until Queenslanders start voting. I call on all Queenslanders to come together and vote in a David Crisafulli LNP government that will focus on your priorities and focus on fixing up the crisis that is impacting our state because of the do-nothing, know-nothing bunch of lazy so-and-sos who are the Labor Party and who aren't looking after Queenslanders.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="266524" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:59</span>):  The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> newspaper reported on 29 August that 'a government owned bank created out of Australia Post is understood to be back on the Labor government's agenda' and that it is 'seen as a response to the closure of numerous bank branches in regional Australia'. I hope this report is well founded, and, if it is, I applaud the government for this welcome development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Years of regulation have failed to force the banks to behave with honesty, decency and compassion. More regulation is not the answer. Big banks will always have better lawyers than the government. The answer is a people's bank offering competition to the big four bank oligopoly—or, more accurately, cartel. As someone who participated in the inquiry into bank closures in regional Australia, I attest that there is a desperate need for a public bank to revolutionise Australia's banking system, the way the original Commonwealth Bank did, which the Fisher Labor government established in 1912.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the big four cartel controls 80 per cent of the market and dominates banking. They're acting together to remove face-to-face banking, which doesn't stop customers from needing face-to-face services. It just forces customers to travel further. It's not just in the regions; it's as difficult for the elderly in the city to travel to the next suburb for their banking as it is for a regional customer to travel to the next town.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw numerous instances of the banks' dishonesty when closing branches, and we're seeing it again right now with ANZ's closure of its Katoomba branch. The ANZ treated Katoomba as a regional branch until it promised to not close the regional branches as a condition of its merger with Suncorp Bank. Lo and behold, suddenly ANZ claims Katoomba is not a regional branch so is proceeding to close it. The big four have concentrated close to 70 per cent of their lending into residential and investor mortgages, with more money fuelling the increase in house prices, while neglecting small business lending and regional communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All four are aggressively pushing customers away from cash and into digital banking and transacting so they can surveil and harvest your data and collect fees on all non-cash transactions. They now gouge Australians out of more than $4 billion per year in transaction fees and surcharges. In short, the big four serve only themselves and use their oligopoly power over a captive market to exploit their customers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a dire need for a public bank that can set standards of service and break up the banking cartel. A post office bank is the perfect way to do it, operating under a modified banking code of practice to restore protections to customers that successive Liberal-National governments have removed and guaranteeing cash and banking services, face-to-face banking in a branch, best interests of the customer and protections against politicisation of banking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth Bank originally started in post offices in 1912, from which it provided banking services to all parts of Australia, even remote areas. It raised loans for the government at one-tenth the cost of the private banks. In the panic of 1914, it protected deposits in all the banks. It supported Australia's agricultural production in World War I and funded the emergency purchase of a fleet of ships in the war, which became Australia's first national shipping line. It made development loans to local councils all across Australia for crucial infrastructure, and it made affordable housing loans to returned soldiers. It accomplished all of this in its first decade, before its political enemies reduced its ability to compete with the private banks, until later when another Labor government unleashed it again in World War II.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Public and post banks are very successful around the world. The Japan Post Bank is one of the world's biggest banks and was the secret to Japan's postwar economic miracle, funding their government's investments in infrastructure and industries. France's post bank, La Banque Postale, started in 2006 and is already Europe's 18th biggest bank and the biggest lender to local councils in France. Kiwibank started as a post bank in 2002, quickly growing into New Zealand's fifth largest bank and the only bank that can compete with New Zealand's big four banks, which Australia's big four banks own. Its first achievement was injecting competition which stopped all branch closures in New Zealand for seven years. In the global financial crisis, Kiwibank was the only bank to increase lending while the private banks all reduced lending. Listen to this: the Bank of North Dakota, not a postal bank but a brilliant state owned bank, supported North Dakota's public finances and its farmers for more than a century, making a profit in every year of operation. In the 2008 financial crisis, North Dakota was the only United States state to stay out of crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I applaud the news that the government is in talks with Australia Post on this solution, and I urge the government to have the vision to create a powerful bank that can once again serve the people of Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:04</span>):  We know that Labor made Medicare and it's only a Labor government that will strengthen and protect it. That is exactly what our government is doing right across the country but especially in Queensland. At the heart of our efforts is a simple yet powerful belief that access to quality health care should not be a privilege but a right for every person, no matter where they live or their financial situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most pressing challenges we face as a nation is the growing need for mental health support. Last week I announced in Mackay a brand-new Medicare mental health centre. This is just one of the ways that our government is tackling mental health in this country. This centre will provide free walk-in mental health support for people in distress as well as ongoing care for those with more complex needs. The Mackay centre is just one of 61 Medicare mental health centres being rolled out across the country, with 19 of those in Queensland, including in Cairns, Townsville and the Torres Strait. This initiative is part of our broader commitment to strengthening Medicare and ensuring that every Australian, regardless of their postcode, has access to the health care that they deserve. It complements our government's Medicare urgent care clinics. Just last week in my hometown of Cairns, I announced that our urgent care clinic had seen over 10,000 patients in just nine months. That's an incredible achievement. This is the Albanese Labor government's promise—delivering care closer to home, where it matters most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is also delivering unprecedented savings on the cost of essential medicines, because we understand that health care comes at a cost, and, during a cost-of-living crisis, this is incredibly important to families. Thanks to our government's cheaper medicines initiatives, Queenslanders have already saved $88 million. These savings are a direct result of the largest cut to the maximum patient co-payment in its 75-year history. Our landmark 60-day prescription reforms have also contributed to these savings. We know how important affordable health care is, especially to those with chronic or ongoing health conditions. By allowing Australians to fill 60-day prescriptions, we're saving them time, reducing the number of visits to the doctor and putting money back into their pockets. Over 10 million prescriptions have already been dispensed under this scheme, helping people with conditions like asthma, anxiety, Parkinson's disease and depression.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're reinvesting every single dollar from this reform into community pharmacies, ensuring even more health services for Australians. In just two years, our government has achieved what the previous government couldn't do in nine, and that's because those opposite have never been committed to Medicare. We've delivered not one but two of the largest increases to the Medicare rebates in 30 years. That's an incredible $900 million this year alone on top of $940 million last year. This means more funding for GPs, more incentives for bulk-billing and more affordable visits to the doctor for every Australian. I'm especially proud of what that means for regional and rural communities. Since tripling the bulk-billing incentive, we've seen over two million additional bulk-billed GP visits across Australia, with regional areas seeing the largest increases. For families with children under 16, pensioners and concession card holders, this makes a huge difference. In May alone, almost a million extra visits were bulk-billed, providing vital relief to households struggling with the cost of living. In rural and regional Australia, the Medicare payments to doctors have increased by as much as 50 per cent, meaning more doctors are able to offer bulk-billing, and more patients can see their GP for free. This is the Albanese government's commitment in action, making health care affordable, accessible and equitable for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we know that we could not achieve this without working together with healthcare workers. I want to pay tribute to those healthcare workers that I stood with in Mackay last week, when we announced this mental health clinic. They do some of the hardest work in our community, working with people suffering acute mental health crisis. In 2012, on this day, the Liberal-National government in Queensland— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RENNICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:09</span>):  I rise today to speak about the lack of water infrastructure being built in this country and the distraction by both state and federal governments away from talking about it. I note that over the last few weeks there's been a lot of discussion around monetary policy in regard to the RBA, around whether the RBA should be independent and around how much independence they have and why certain sections of the RBA Act should be withdrawn. It's a shame that this conversation is happening, because it's distracting from the real potential of what monetary policy can be, which is to fund the construction of infrastructure. In the same way that companies issue new shares to build new mines or to buy another company or to construct a new factory, countries and federal governments who have their own currency should look at issuing infrastructure bonds to build sovereign infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go through the wasted opportunities out there at the moment. Every time it rains we're letting this beautiful, precious water flow out to the sea. I've got the flows from the Murray-Darling Basin that have been released from the Snowy Hydro project, probably Australia's greatest infrastructure project ever. In 2003 the total flows from the Snowy Hydro project was about 2,000 gigalitres. Last year it was about 1,300 gigalitres. At the same time, buybacks have increased from around 2,000 gigalitres to 3,400 gigalitres. So we are now allowing more and more water to flow out to sea rather than capturing it and using it for irrigation. But that's the Snowy Hydro.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's another place, about 2,000 kilometres up the road from Snowy Hydro, called the Clarence River. It has the potential to deliver twice the energy, twice the power of the existing Snowy Hydro project. And of course there's a number of dams on the Clarence River that would be involved in this. You would be able to build a tunnel—not a very big one—that would push water from the eastern seaboard to the western seaboard. There is often discussion in my home state of Queensland about capturing the water in the north and sending it south. I'd disagree with that proposal. I'm from western Queensland. I know the area where, under this idea, we're going to push water down through the south. But it won't get that far; it will evaporate away. By all means push it out as far as Hughenden, on the black soils there, but you don't need to take it any further.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we can do in this country is push water from east to west, because we have this wonderful thing called the Great Dividing Range. The scientist in me, looking at a mountain range, sees potential energy. The total energy of a system is of course potential energy plus kinetic energy. When all that water is trapped and caught on the high part of the range it can, depending on where you push it, create energy as it falls down to the coastline. Or, if we want to push it inland, it can create energy that way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're debating monetary policy and whether the RBA should be independent, and we also discuss policy, and we're having this debate about nuclear at the moment. But we're missing a very key component of this energy debate, which is hydro energy. The beauty of hydro energy is that it not only can be used to create energy but also can be used for irrigation. I would strongly urge all state governments, particularly Queensland and New South Wales, to look at utilising the water supplies, the water opportunities that we have in those states—and in other states, I should add; there are some good locations for dams in Western Australia—to increase productivity in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've named the Clarence River. There's also Urannah Dam. There's Nathan Dam. There's the Burdekin Falls Dam. There's Hells Gates Dam. There's the Fitzroy Dam over in WA. They are the potential dam sites from which we can, especially along the eastern seaboard, on the Great Dividing Range, produce hydro energy and actually look at drought proofing, to the extent you can, the inland areas of western New South Wales and parts of Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not that long a pipeline that you need in order to push the water from the Clarence into the Darling system out through Copeton Dam and into the Gwydir. And you could get water into the Darling system from there. That is a much smarter idea than trying to bring it from North Queensland. But I urge all governments to be much smarter about how they go about being productive in this country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:14</span>):  Last Friday, I had the privilege of chairing a national road transport industry round table here in parliament. Thirty-seven industry leaders from right across the road transport sector came together for the day to talk about the priorities for the next tranche of transport reform. State and territory transport associations were at the table alongside representatives from the big trucking companies, small-to-medium operators, owner-drivers, the bus industry and the Transport Workers' Union. We all agreed that we need to continue to work together to address the challenges facing our industry. We all agreed that we need to continue to work together to improve the lot of our transport operators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Put simply, we have an ageing workforce, and we don't have enough drivers, forklift drivers, receival staff, loaders, tyre fitters, diesel mechanics, admin staff, sales staff and managers—it goes on and on. We need to train and retain these people, especially the ones that we have. A recent survey released by the National Road Transport Association revealed there are 26,049 unfilled truck driver positions in 2024. That's just the drivers. Those numbers are expected to get worse. Colleagues, this is a crisis for our trucking industry, which means it is a crisis for our national economy. If we can't find those additional drivers, train them and develop career paths for them, there will be significant impacts on our supply chains and on our country. Forty-seven per cent of truck drivers working in Australia today are aged 55 years or older, whilst just 5.2 per cent are younger than 25 years. The average age is 49.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We face similar challenges filling other roles in the transport industry, as I've said. We all learnt through COVID that the supply chain is the backbone of our economy, but, without enough drivers, the entire system is at risk. This is the challenge we came together to talk about last week. The round table heard from the various state transport associations about their activities and priorities around the recruitment, retention and training of drivers. Large transport operators talked about their individual activities aimed at recruiting and retaining their truck driver workforce. We all agreed that foreign drivers are welcome in this country. However, as an industry, we know there are flawed and discredited state training schemes where—listen to this—drivers can obtain a licence within a few hours, having never driven a truck before. All truck drivers, no matter where they come from, must be trained and licensed to Australian standards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The peak representative bodies that attended all expressed the need for national action and leadership. We kicked off the round table by hearing from Peter Anderson from ARTIO and Michael Kaine from the Transport Workers' Union. Both reminded the group of the importance of working together and of what has already been achieved. When industry and workers come together, we can achieve great things in this nation. Thirty-day payments, secure employment and fair rates of pay, with a specific road transport advisory group advising the Fair Work Commission, are all reforms supported by industry, owner-drivers and transport workers. But, as we all agreed on Friday, there is a lot more to be done. The round table agreed that the next priority must be the development of career pathways for drivers, the finalisation of skills and licensing and the development of a national training agenda and package. Industry desperately needs access to fit-for-purpose training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many other issues were raised by the group, like the need to recognise transport as an essential service and the need for small and big transport operators to work together to bring young people into the industry and nurture them. The group also repeatedly expressed their frustrations with the divide between Commonwealth and states. If industry leaders can come together and agree on a set of priorities for the road transport sector, I ask: why can't state, territory and Commonwealth transport ministers do the same? Roundtable participants suggested that making transport reform a priority for National Cabinet might be a way of breaking this deadlock. Of course, the bus industry faces similar challenges. However, their operators face the additional challenge of the removal of the incentives for bus operators to take on apprentices and for training new bus drivers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a real buzz in the air throughout the day, particularly when the Prime Minister dropped in to say hello and share his views on the importance of the transport industry. Prime Minister, I thank you for that, and so do they. As I mentioned earlier, most of those in the room last week have worked together over many years to develop support for the important reforms contained in the closing-the-loopholes legislation. We have so much more to do, and we will continue to push for greater standards in the road transport industry.</span>

Is anyone in this place really buying this? If this government were really concerned about children's welfare it would have already banned puberty blockers for kids. If the government were really that motivated to protect kids it would remove radical gender theory from all schools and all classrooms—everywhere—for all age groups. This government expects us to believe that an Instagram account is more dangerous than telling children they've been born in the wrong body and they require a lifetime of medication to suppress and stifle their natural development. This government will attempt to sterilise kids without sanction but won't let them near a Facebook account, though—no, no. Give me a break!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Prime Minister says he is all about protecting children. Really, Prime Minister? Riddle me this: how is it that your own literary awards just shortlisted a children's book titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Welcome to Sex</span>, which describes in graphic detail the most wicked of sex acts? The author of this book said that she would 'be happy with a mature eight-year-old having a flick through the book'. So eight-year-olds can learn about sex acts that I don't feel comfortable repeating here in this chamber with parliamentary privilege? So this book is acceptable—okay, great—but God forbid your child scrolls through Instagram or TikTok. Are you serious, Prime Minister?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How does the government propose to stop children accessing social media except with some kind of digital ID being required to interact online? That seems to be where we're going. And here is the real issue: is the government actually interested in protecting children or potentially more motivated to roll out the digital ID system? Protecting kids from the harms of social media, in my opinion, could be nothing more than a trojan horse. We have increasingly authoritarian governments throughout the West that are intent on removing freedom of speech and monitoring everything that is said online. I'm sure they're going to protest and say that it's not their agenda and that their only concern is safety et cetera—and the gullible might believe it, just as people believed that masks and vaccines were for their safety, the crackdown on mis- and disinformation was for their safety and the removal of their guns was for their safety. Garbage! It's about government power; that's what it's about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Promising to protect the citizenry from all manner of harms, the government convinces us to give them more and more power until, eventually, none of us are safe from the most dangerous entity in the entirety of human history—the state. I don't doubt that children need protecting, but the people best placed to protect children are their parents. We don't need a nanny state dictating how old your child must be before he or she can watch a funny video on Instagram or communicate with their grandparents on Messenger. We don't need Prime Minister Albanese or his eSafety Commissioner policing our interactions online. Once we give the government power, the only thing that it wants is more power—and it never ends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both Labor and the coalition have promised to ban children from social media. They'll tell us about protecting kids, like I said before, but it's really about corporate and government surveillance into every corner of our digital lives. Social media is of course not a safe space for kids—I agree—but the answer is not to strip away everyone's freedoms under the pretence of protection. Once we lose freedoms, they're gone for good. Like I said, the best people to protect children are those children's parents, not the government, and the greatest form of governance in the world is the nuclear family. Delegating family responsibilities to the state never ends harm; it only serves to perpetuate harm. We must resist government overreach.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="250026" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LAMBIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  Whenever a government, any government, want to avoid expert advice, they commission their own inquiry. That's exactly what the Tasmanian Liberal government did when there were calls for a rigorous independent inquiry based on the work of independent economist Saul Eslake and Tasmanian workforce demographer Dr Lisa Denny.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmanian kids aren't smarter or stupider than other kids around the nation, but we are the nation's high school dropout capital. That's what we are in Tasmania. We are also the bottom of the class when it comes to reading and numeracy skills. This is even more shocking when you find out the Tasmanian government spends more per student than any other state, yet we are failing our kids miserably in Tasmania. Just over half of all students get their year 12 equivalent, which is the lowest figure of any state in this nation. It is absolutely shameful. Tassie is also the poorest state. According to independent experts, including Dr Lisa Denny and Saul Eslake, if we fixed our education system, we wouldn't be as broke as we are today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The experts are clear, especially where literacy is concerned. Tasmanian teachers still teach whole learning. Basically, the idea is to show a child the whole word and move quickly to the meaning. Seriously! You might want to get the word under control to start with. The problem is that most experts say we should be teaching kids phonics—that is, learning the letter sounds. Let's go back to the good old days. The government is trying to change this, but, unfortunately, the education union doesn't like it. God knows why, because the older teachers have been doing it that way for their whole careers, and this way is failing us. We need to go to the phonics. We need to try something different. We can't keep going over the same stuff in Tasmania year in, year out—it keeps failing and every year it gets worse for our kids—and not change the system. This is nuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Denny and Mr Eslake also point to the college system we have in Tasmania. Oh my goodness, I could sit here and spend hours on this, the absolute cluster which has been rolled out by the Tasmanian Liberal government. What a mess! This may work well in the ACT where, let's face it, people have more money. If you are one of those Tassie kids who lives outside an urban centre and who wants to finish year 11 and 12, you often must travel some distance to a college. The Tasmanian government also tried to fix this, but they went only halfway. What's new? As usual, instead of making tough decisions, they tried to keep everyone happy. They didn't want to lose any votes. You actually gain votes when you do 100 per cent instead of 50 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal government has extended more high schools to year 12 but has stopped short of abolishing colleges. Dr Denny said that the extension process has been incredibly poorly implemented and compromised by colleges striking deals with high schools to provide some year 11 and 12 students. In an attempt to head off a sweeping parliamentary inquiry into educational failings, the Liberal minority state government recently announced its own review. That's it—they're going to review their own failure. So the Liberal Party that failed in the first place is now going to reveal its own failings. This keeps getting better! They've got a whole new police on the beat in state parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No doubt that review will say the government has the situation in hand. That's how it works. But these are our kids. They are our Tasmanian kids. Besides having a roof over their heads and food in their bellies, their education matters more than anything. If we want to have a thriving economy—as Saul Eslake has reportedly said not just in his most recent report but for years—we need to get our education system working properly for all of our kids. We need to have kids that are ready for jobs—jobs that they need now and that we need in the future. That is what all Tasmanians deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't even have time to go into our TAFEs. Oh my goodness, what a joke! I saw TAFE Australia the other day and TAFE are still in a mess. They are telling me that, even under this government, they are worse. What was worrying was, when I asked them which TAFEs were working well and which TAFEs needed to have their facilities fixed up, they didn't have the answers. So, if those TAFEs around Australia don't know what each one of their TAFEs is doing, what they are educating and what needs to be done construction-wise there, how can the government possibly say that they have this under control? They are just rolling out extra positions and saying they're doing something with our TAFEs. Rubbish!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:29</span>):  I rise to speak with a bit of a wake-up call for stakeholders, river managers and state governments. On 28 June this year, water ministers met to discuss the release of the Productivity Commission's inquiry report on national water reform and to talk about replacing the National Water Initiative with a new national water agreement. It's not such a bad concept after nearly two decades of the National Water Initiative. A renewal is timely. However, I made the point at the time that never before have so many Labor water ministers had so little to say on important water reform, with the meeting running for less than an hour. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment there are draft principles for the new National Water Agreement doing the rounds, drafted by the bureaucracies with very little input from stakeholders, and I'm wondering how much input there was from state governments. This draft principles paper contains over 300 principles, with an immense lack of detail around how they would be implemented and what it would actually mean to implement them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Governments absolutely need to go back to the drawing board to work with stakeholders to look at what the consequences of adopting these high-level, feel-good principles would actually be if put into practice. We've got to get beyond the theory. We've got to get beyond the 'vibe' and we must start to concentrate on what it means in practice. Can it be done, can it be done affordably and can it be done without negative social and economic impacts across our communities?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  Today I stand here to honour the memory of a very dear friend of mine and a wonderful South Australian, Ian Smith, who passed away in July this year. In doing so, my thoughts are with Ian's wife, Sue; his daughter, Maddie; and the many family and friends who loved him and miss him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ian was an absolute giant of the labour movement in South Australia, with his work over many years not just changing lives but saving lives when it came to transport reform. He joined the Transport Workers Union 30 years ago, and in making that decision he changed the course of history, although he never would have thought it at the time. Ian went on to become a lead delegate at TNT and then a TWU official before being elected branch assistant secretary and then branch secretary, until he stepped down earlier this year because of his health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ian refused to settle for injustice, and he fought against it relentlessly, and so many lives are the better for his actions and his work. Often, he took up these fights when he was in an extraordinary amount of pain, but this work was so important to Ian, and he knew that he had such a powerful role as an advocate to change people's lives for the better. He believed that transport workers deserved better, and he dedicated his entire career to making that so. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was so proud to work with him on the closing loopholes legislation, which has set up the architecture for a complete reform of the gig economy—something Ian fought so hard for. He campaigned for those laws, for those protections and for the election of a Labor government to enact them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am so proud to have fought with him in that reform work. It is just one way in which Ian Smith's life and his work changed our world for the better and changed the industry to be safer. His legacy is vast. It lives on in the work that we carry forward. Ian, I will miss you so much.</span>

The colour of the sky changed. The sky was filled with screams, crying and the sound of ambulances.' That was how an eyewitness described Israel's latest massacre in Gaza, committed yesterday. There have been just too many. We can't bear to look, but we should never look away. Families were sheltering in tents in what was supposed to be a safe zone, and they were burnt alive, buried in the sand. The bombing was so severe it left a deep crater at al-Mawasi and melted bodies. At least 19 people were slaughtered, and the death toll is expected to climb. That is on top of the 41,000 Palestinians already slaughtered.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, while Israel is slaughtering families day after day, burning them alive in tents, down in Melbourne major weapons companies, including the Israeli firm Elbit Systems, are gathering for an arms expo. My solidarity is with the thousands protesting in Melbourne today to say no to the business of war and to say no to Australia being complicit in genocide, because that is where this Labor government has, shamefully, positioned this country. Labor tries to distract and deflect, but there is no deflection. So long as we have defence contracts with Israeli weapons companies, the Labor government is complicit in genocide. So long as we refuse to impose sanctions on Israel, this Labor government is complicit in genocide.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are no excuses for inaction. The UK has suspended some arms sales to Israel. Canada today is halting more arms sales to Israel. What will it take for the Labor government to take action against the apartheid State of Israel? Your hollow words and pointless phone calls are nothing but a smokescreen, and everyone can see through it. Do something! Take action!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  My parents were farmers. My grandparents were farmers. My great-grandparents were farmers. If you go to my office, you will see an old milk can and you'll see some old K-knives up on the wall. So yesterday, standing alongside Peter Dutton and David Littleproud, I was proud to be able to look those farmers in the eye and tell them that we supported them—a simple message but a truthful one—because, under this Albanese Labor government, our farmers and our regional communities are having their lives destroyed and their way of life destroyed, and the explanation from Labor and the Greens is just radio silence. It's disgusting, it's disgraceful and it's wrong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, farmers who spent thousands of dollars to get here to Canberra, especially those from WA, to have a conversation about the very essence of their existence received absolutely nothing from our Prime Minister. He was a no-show, and it's not a surprise because this government has been a no-show when it comes to our rural, regional and remote communities. No Labor MP and no Greens MP went out the front of this building to talk to those farmers. They all hid inside here and stayed in their offices—these politicians who think that food comes from a fridge, from a cupboard or from a restaurant that they eat in; these politicians who do not understand that, if we do not have farmers, then we will not have food to feed our people and, as importantly, we will not be able to export our food to help feed the region. Our farmers want some common sense, and they'll only get that under a coalition government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  Young people in the workforce have many advantages. Being in the workforce builds skills, responsibility and confidence and it introduces these fine young people to managing their own finances. That's why it's so important that our young workers are well remunerated for the contribution that they make to their workplace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, also known as the SDA union, recently launched its Adult Age Adult Wage campaign with the aim of ending junior rates in the retail, fast-food and pharmacy awards for workers aged 18 and over. The SDA also seeks to raise the wages of junior workers under 18. Turning 18 does not mean that you ought to be penalised, but it does mean that you are legally considered an adult and that you are able to be and should be paid an adult wage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Workers deserve to be paid for the work that they perform, regardless of the year that they were born. Workers deserve to receive the payment that every other worker in the workplace is entitled to. Young workers don't deserve to receive less income than their co-workers over 21, despite performing the same job. That was the main message that young SDA representatives gave senators and MPs during their recent visit to Parliament House, and I'd like to thank those dedicated workers for sharing their stories with us. It's also worth noting that these workers don't receive superannuation on every dollar that they earn when they are under the age of 18. The costs of owning a car and paying bills or rent aren't reduced for people who are under the age of 18, and neither should be their pay. Some of Australia's major companies already pay adult rates at 18, and it's time that this became the norm across the retail, fast food and pharmacy sectors.</span>

It was eight years ago today that I made my first speech in the Senate. It would be an understatement to say these speeches caused a bit of a stir. For daring to say things that needed to be said, I was hounded by the media and the political class of this country and called all sorts of ridiculous names. I called out immigration, political Islam, multiculturalism, equality for all Australians, the Aboriginal industry and abolishing ATSIC.</span>

Australians are facing homelessness and mortgage stress while hordes of new arrivals and foreign students take up available housing and rentals.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  I am calling on the Australian Bureau of Statistics and Treasury to stop misrepresenting the export value of international students. Foreign students pay $13 billion in tuition fees and are largely responsible for the $8.6 billion in remittances out of Australia, a net gain of $4.4 billion to Australia in terms of actual cross-border exchange, yet for some perverse reason the ABS report all expenditure incurred by students living in Australia as an export to derive a figure of $48 billion. This figure is patently false and masks the fact that foreign remittances sent from Australia have been rapidly increasing, from $3 billion in 2021 to $8.6 billion in 2024.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's bad enough that, in a housing crisis, universities are allowed to import so many students, knowing it'll make it harder for Australians to find housing, but to pretend that universities are punching above their weight economically when they aren't is just deceptive. As a former accountant, if I were to engage in this type of misleading reporting, I would get sacked or sent to jail. It is time the ABS, Treasury, the media, the sector themselves and policymakers in both major parties acknowledged this inconvenient truth.</span>

I speak of generation Z, who will be playing a substantial role in the next election, and generation alpha, who will start to come of age during the election after. It is for this reason that I will now render the remainder of my statement using language they're familiar with.</span>

A few of you may remember when they said, 'There will be no fanum tax under the government I lead.' They're capaholics. They're also yapaholics. They yap non-stop about how their cost-of-living measures are changing lives for all Australians. Just put the fries in the bag, lil bro.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They tell us that they're locked in on improving the housing situation in this country. They must have brainrot from watching too much Kai Cenat and forgot about their plans to ban social media for kids under 14. If that becomes law, you can 'forgor skull emoji' all about watching Duke Dennis or catching a dub with the bros on Fort. Chat, is this Prime Minister serious? Even though he's the Prime Minister of Australia, sometimes it feels like he's the CEO of Ohio. I would be taking an L if I did not mention the opps who want to cut WA's gyatts and services tax.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Around the world, for far too long, environmentalists have been persecuted, assaulted and, in some cases, tragically, murdered just for defending nature. In recent times we've seen governments of both political stripes in this country and around the world enact draconian anti-protest legislation and arrest and jail people who are defending nature and demanding climate action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One recent example is the arrest of Captain Paul Watson in Greenland about six weeks ago at the request of the government of Japan. That request is nothing more than a politically motivated attempt to punish Captain Watson for his decades-long defence of whales, his decades-long defence of ocean ecosystems and his defiance of illegal whaling, in particular by Japan in the Southern Ocean. If extradited, Captain Watson faces up to 15 years in a Japanese prison. That is simply unacceptable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Danish government should immediately drop proceedings against Captain Watson, refuse to extradite him to Japan and free him immediately. The Australian government should use all diplomatic influence and channels it has at its disposal to try and deliver that outcome. Every member of this parliament has received a request from the Captain Paul Watson Foundation to sign a letter to the Danish Prime Minister calling for Captain Watson's release. All Greens members have done that, and I encourage everyone to do that. Captain Paul Watson is an environmental hero. He should be celebrated not persecuted, and his actions should be applauded rather than having landed him in prison. Free Paul Watson now!</span>

Many drove their trucks for thousands of kilometres to be here. The war on farmers conducted not just here but in Western nations around the world is complete and utter madness. The government is changing the rules on water. The government has destroyed the live sheep export trade. The government has hamstrung farmers with ridiculous climate policies and red tape. The government is covering prime agricultural land with solar panels, wind turbines and transmission lines.</span>

The attack on our farmers is an attack on humanity itself, and whatever you might think about carbon emissions, we are a carbon-based life form, which means that this war on carbon is actually a war on humanity. How can it not be a war on humanity? We absolutely must end this net zero insanity. Obviously I stand with our farmers, but, more importantly, I stand with everyone who values life. Everyone who thinks the same way that I do needs to not only support our farmers but support change and support the UAP. </span>

Soon you won't even be able to use the internet without a digital ID, and it gets worse. Big tech companies tell us that, to make it work, they're going to need a 'collection of new personal data such as facial imagery or government-issued ID'. It's not going to stop at kids on social media; it's going to be used for everything in your digital life: facial scans, fingerprints and who knows what other data will soon be needed just to simply exist online. You can kiss your privacy goodbye, and you can kiss goodbye your freedom of speech. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all want our kids to be safe online, but safety is always the first excuse. The safety of our children can't be used as a Trojan Horse for the real objectives: control over the narrative and profits for the corporate media sector. Now these Labor governments—who, by the way, are the same Labor governments who do nothing about the sexually explicit books in our kids' libraries or about the life-altering puberty-blocking drugs being fed to them across the nation—tell us that they're the ones who are worried about the safety of our children online. Give me a break.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  I know what it's like to be on the waitlist for public housing. I was a single mum and a carer for my nephew, and I had a very tight budget. I know the value of having somewhere safe to live that is yours, whether that be social housing, somewhere you're renting or a place you have a mortgage on. Not all of us have that. For all of us to have that, we need more homes. This is something I fought hard for when negotiating for Tasmania to have a minimum guarantee of 1,200 homes as part of the Housing Australia Future Fund negotiations. We really need those homes in Tassie, and I know it's the same in your electorates as well. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently attended the Civil Contractors Federation Tasmania Earth Awards dinner in Hobart. It was great to meet the members, but what I was really interested in was how these civil construction projects were going to help us get more people into homes. I clapped as Tasmanian civil construction operators, contractors, trainees and apprentices won awards for projects, management, innovation, training, environmental management and safety, but I really wanted to hear more about the medium- and high-density projects that will house the Tasmanians who need somewhere to live. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know house prices won't shift until housing supply is addressed. We know rents will stay high while there isn't enough housing stock to rent. The simple fact is that we don't have enough houses for Tasmanians. We don't have enough houses for people across this country. The solution to a lack of houses to buy and rent is to build more houses, and that's what the HAFF is supposed to do. We've already voted to build these homes, so let's make them happen. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  In five days time the AUKUS agreement will be three years old, but, in the last 36 months, all we've really got from AUKUS is the cancellation of other needed defence programs so that Australian taxpayers can cover the massive $368 billion price tag. This huge, all-eggs-in-one-basket program comes at a huge opportunity cost to the rest of the Australian Defence Force.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Putting the cost to one side, we're supposed to get three US Virginia class submarines sometime in the mid-2030s, but we'll get them only if the US can increase its submarine build rate from 1.4 to 2.3 boats a year. We're gifting $4.7 billion of your money, Australians, to try and increase the build rate, but expert commentators are predicting the US won't hit its target of 2.3 boats a year, so they won't hand over any of the Virginia class submarines to Australia. Good one on that! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The geniuses in Defence haven't negotiated any refund of your money if they don't come through on their commitment. How much of a dud is this deal? Then we'll apparently build five UK designed AUKUS submarines. That's the plan, despite the fact the UK are reliably late and overbudgeted on all their shipbuilding programs and they can't put any of their current Astute class submarines to sea. It's hardly an inspiring choice of partner, is it? This is it—this is the mess you've left us in.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also written them a $4 billion cheque, Australians, to help them get their act together, again with no refund option for you taxpayers out there. AUKUS is eye-wateringly expensive. It won't give useful capability anytime soon. It bleeds money from other defence programs, leaving our defence industry without work, undermining our sovereignty and harming national security. Sadly, this bad idea seems to be all but unstoppable.</span>

There's no doubt that watching our Paralympians compete on the world stage and watching them share their stories has empowered our nation, particularly many young Australians, to participate. It's empowering big dreams and empowering us to pursue our dreams no matter what adversity gets thrown in our way. Importantly, it provides encouragement to all Australians, particularly young Australians, to get out there and participate in sport.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has been behind our team every step or wheel of the way, because we've witnessed a demonstration of human spirit, of strength, of talent, of teamwork and, most particularly, of resilience. What a fantastic way to finish off the games with gold medallists Lauren Parker and James Turner carrying the flag at the closing ceremony. It was a privilege this morning to join the family, friends and supporters of our para-athletes in welcoming them home to Australian soil. But, above all, there was a deep appreciation for the fact that these athletes are competing at the top of their field, and they have overcome significant adversity to be there. There is no doubt that our athletes left our shores as athletes and have returned as national heroes.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I think it's fair to say that every single Australian, our entire country, thanks and congratulates our Paralympic team for how they have represented our nation on the world stage and for the empowerment and encouragement they have provided every Australian who has watched on from home.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  Yesterday I had the pleasure of meeting with Ella, Jo and Sheila, who work in housing and homelessness, financial counselling and family and domestic violence from my home state of Victoria. They travelled to Parliament House with over 20 of their colleagues from around the country to advocate for the ASU's campaign to ensure that their incredibly skilled work is respected and equal. Ella, Jo, Sheila and thousands of their colleagues are part of the community and disability sectors, which have been historically undervalued, woman dominated and award reliant. They are also trailblazers in campaigning for equal pay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These workers are continuing their leadership for women workers by pursuing a campaign in their workplaces, in the parliament and in the Fair Work Commission to have their work recognised as skilled, respected and equal, which seeks to fix the classification structure in their award to stop employers being able to systematically undervalue their work. The campaign also seeks to close the longstanding loophole that allows disability support allows workers to be underpaid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sheila told me that, despite her many years in the family violence sector, instead of her pay rate increasing with her years of experience, skill and expertise, she is paid less now than she was when she began. To add insult to injury, the work she has been doing over this time has become increasingly more complex. The ASU, ably led by National Secretary Emiline Gaske, is supporting these workers. This support has included commissioning research that found a whopping 67 per cent of workers just like Sheila are underclassified. They want this fixed and our support in doing so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To those amazing workers who have travelled to Canberra and all of their colleagues in vital community services supporting vulnerable Australians everywhere, thank you for raising your voices in advocating for your sector so you can keep supporting the millions of Australians who need your expertise every day.</span>

Minister, despite both your own and the Treasurer's attempts to blame the shocking national accounts figures on interest rates, independent analysis from the RBA and market economists has revealed those claims to be false. ABS data shows that inflation wiped out 4.4 percentage points of household income gains last financial year compared to higher interest rates, eroding 1.3 per cent, and increased taxes, reducing real income by a further 1.1 per cent. That's according to analysis by former RBA economist Jonathan Kearns, who said, 'The erosion by inflation is greater than that of interest rates.' Minister, will you correct the record for the Treasurer and acknowledge that inflation and higher taxes are eroding household incomes by three times as much as interest rates?</span>

I think the Treasurer and I have both made very clear the fact that we inherited an inflation number with a six in front of it when we came to government, and that has moderated in welcome ways to have a three in front of it now. I'm sure Senator Sharma would have been most concerned about the escalating inflation challenge that we inherited and that we have actually responded to through our economic plan. Our economic plan is around moderating inflation, ensuring that we can provide some cost-of-living relief to households without adding to the inflation challenge and ensuring that we're getting the budget in much better shape. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Reserve Bank has made it clear that the two surpluses that we are delivering—one that we've already delivered and one soon to be finalised—are actually helping with the inflation challenge in the economy. I don't think there is anything surprising in the sense that we have outlined that price pressures across the world, inflation, global uncertainty and interest rates are being reflected in the national accounts. You can choose to selectively single out one element of what we've said, but we have said price pressures, global uncertainty and interest rates are being reflected in the national accounts. And, if it wasn't for our economic plan, whilst all of those opposite called to cut spending and slash and burn at budget time, we would have seen a much different set of results and that would have seen our economy in recession. The only people in the country that seem to want a recession are those opposite.</span>

That is why the Prime Minister has announced that the Albanese government will be creating a new minimum age for access to social media. We will bring legislation forward before the end of the year, and I look forward to those opposite supporting it.</span>

South Australia has released a report by the former Chief Justice of Australia the Hon. Robert French AC outlining a legislative vehicle to ban children under the age of 14 from accessing social media. Why is it important that we work with the states and territories to build on South Australia's approach with national laws on a minimum age to access social media?</span>

We thank South Australia, including Premier Malinauskas, for its work and we acknowledge the contribution of Premier Minns, too, but ultimately the issue needs national leadership, because otherwise we will see Australia with different laws in each state and territory.

Given Regis Resources had already spent $200 million on the mine by the time of Ms Plibersek's decision, and to help us better understand the accuracy of the minister's attempted comparison, could the minister tell us what each of the equivalent figures for the go-kart track were?</span>

There are, in fact, a very great number of similarities between the two decisions. Minister Plibersek made her decision based on the advice of the same traditional owner group as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition consulted with, the Wiradyuri Traditional Owners Central West Aboriginal Corporation. She made the same type of decision, a section 10 decision under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, and I would observe that that act has been in place since the 1980s and operative under a range of governments of different flavours.</span>

In contrast, Labor's section 10 decision, proposed by fewer than 20 people, has left those same locals furious and at a loss as to how they'll continue to live and work in the area. How can the minister so offensively equate the economic blow to the Blayney community with the decision to prevent a go-kart track from being built?</span>

I will say this. Ms Plibersek has repeatedly indicated that her obligation is to apply the law. What is extraordinary is that Mr Dutton, the Leader of the Opposition, has indicated that he is indifferent to the law on these questions—that he will rule these projects in or out based on how he feels about them.</span>

How can the minister justify this decision?</span>

The way it works is that the department provides advice to the minister on the application and its merits, and this includes providing a summary of the application, a map of the area and its boundary, a detailed analysis of the available evidence, an assessment of the evidence against the relevant criteria and any other matters of relevance. Submissions from the applicant and those received from any other interested party throughout the course of the evaluation period are also summarised and presented to the minister. Procedural fairness is carefully observed in the processing of applications made under this act. In advice to the minister, the department also outlines how the principles of procedural fairness have been observed. Those are the similarities. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Minister, the federal government's own Threatened Species Scientific Committee recently estimated that there are just 40 to 120 maugean skate left on this planet, provided preliminary advice that the skate be uplisted to 'critically endangered', and stated very clearly that salmon production in the skate's last known home, Macquarie Harbour, in Tasmania, poses a catastrophic risk to the survival of the skate. Minister, does your government accept the findings made by the committee that industrial salmon farming is the single biggest threat to the survival of the maugean skate in its natural habitat?</span>

Of course, the Australian government are deeply committed to ensuring that the maugean skate does not go extinct under our watch. We know that this is a species at high risk of extinction, as you have alluded to in your question, and that substantially reduced water quality in Macquarie Harbour is the primary contributing factor. The minister is aware of these issues. You will know, I think, because we have talked about it in estimates, that on 12 October the minister held a roundtable discussion in Devonport with industry, with government and with other stakeholders regarding Macquarie Harbour aquaculture, and she wrote to the Tasmanian Premier, Mr Rockliff, on 6 November 2023 and provided really clear information to him about her responsibilities under the EPBC Act with regard to salmon farming in that harbour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the minister has been asked to reconsider a decision, made back in 2012 under the EPBC Act, about marine farming in Macquarie Harbour, including whether current farming operations require further approvals under national environment law. The department is rigorously assessing a very large volume of information relevant to that decision and, I understand, will soon provide Minister Plibersek with advice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Macquarie Harbour will need long-term support to recover, and the Australian government is actively working with the Tasmanian government, technical experts and community stakeholders to achieve that, but we also acknowledge that in the short term there are things that we can do. You will be aware that in September last year the minister announced $2.15 million to urgently initiate a captive breeding program ahead of hot summer conditions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:22</span>):  As you point out, Minister, it has been 221 days since Minister Plibersek was ordered to reconsider that 2012 decision to expand salmon farming, yet evidence at an Administrative Appeals Tribunal hearing last week revealed the minister doesn't yet have a brief on this decision. Minister, why has it taken 221 days, and are you kicking the can down the road till after the next election?</span>

It's an issue that is of real concern to industry and of real interest and importance to industry and to many conservationists in the local community as well. The consequence of that, in part, is that over 2½ thousand submissions have been received by the minister. The government is carefully considering the information and the scientific advice that it has obtained to ensure that there is a proper, legally robust decision, and I think you will understand that it will take time to do that properly.</span>

Minister, if you want to prevent extinctions, at some point you will have to do something that will prevent extinctions. Will you listen to the scientific advice that has been before you for months, stop salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour and give the skate the best possible chance of survival?</span>

But you are right: there are things that we can do now in advance of that decision, and we are working to ensure the protection of the skate. I spoke earlier of the $5.7 million that is being invested to help protect the skate and improve that health of the harbour. That includes a $2.1 million program to establish this captive breeding program, and we are pleased to report that that program is helping to save the maugean skate. More than 19 baby skates have hatched and over 100 new eggs have been laid in captivity.</span>

                  </a>  Especially this bloke here! At the last election, Minister, federal Labor promised to get wages moving again and support Australian workers. We know that low wages and insecure work were a deliberate design feature of the coalition's economic plan when they were last in government. We also know that these policies led to high levels of industrial action and rising cost-of-living pressures on Australian households. After a decade of deliberate wage stagnation and attacks on workers, how is the Albanese Labor government's policy agenda supporting Australian workers to earn more and keep more of what they earn while also keeping industrial action low?</span>

I can see why you were so excited to ask that question. There is good news for Australian workers and Australian businesses arising from the Albanese government workplace reforms. The Albanese Labor government is helping working people in Australia to earn more and keep more of what they earn. After a decade of low wages being a deliberate design feature of the coalition's economic policy, this Labor government is getting wages moving again, creating more secure jobs, making workplaces safer and closing the gender pay gap, all while keeping industrial action down.</span>

It is unfortunate that that side of the chamber feels so upset and so disappointed every time we talk about the fact that our workplace reforms are delivering higher wages, more secure jobs and safer workplaces and are closing the gender pay gap, all while keeping industrial action down. I don't know why you're so sad about that, but every time we talk about it you arc up, you cry and you complain. It's very, very puzzling.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of our agenda, wages growth is back, the gender pay gap is at its lowest level ever, there are more people in jobs and industrial action is low. In fact, in the last quarter of the previous government, industrial action was far higher than it is now, and that is because Labor has built a cooperative workplace relations system to replace the conflict driven model that we inherited. We've closed loopholes which is benefiting workers and also benefiting businesses, stopping them from being undercut by rogue competitors. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Given the coalition's track record of attacking workers' rights and wages, how are the government's reforms supporting workers and the economy, and what is the biggest challenge to implementing these very important reforms?</span>

We already know that Mr Dutton, Senator Cash and all their colleagues over there are out there running scare campaigns against higher wages and more cooperative workplaces. It wasn't that long ago that we had Senator Cash out there saying Labor's workplace law changes would close down Australia. Sadly for Senator Cash, Australia is open and functioning and—you know what?—delivering higher wages and more jobs, reducing the gender pay gap and reducing industrial action all at the same time.</span>

What will that actually mean for the Western Australian economy? Under this government, employment growth in Western Australia is at a record high of 3.6 per cent. Under the Morrison government, it was 1.6 per cent. Wages in Western Australia have been growing faster under this government than under the Morrison government, and working days lost to industrial disputes in Western Australia have fallen under this government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

They get upset when we talk about wages rising, more secure jobs, a lower gender pay gap and, importantly, lower industrial action. Unlike those opposite, who thrive on conflict, this government is focused on bringing businesses and workers together to ease cost-of-living pressures and deliver higher wages and more productivity for businesses. We know the coalition had an anti-worker and anti-union agenda when they were in government. They deliberately kept wages low, kept workers in insecure work and refused to fix the bargaining system, leading to more industrial action. We know the coalition have already committed to ripping away rights for casual workers and taking away the right for workers to stop working for free with our right to disconnect—scrapping casual worker rights and scrapping the right to disconnect. They're on the record saying it. We had Senator Hume out there saying adding more rights for workers is 'unreasonable', and that's because the coalition have a plan to take a targeted package of repeals to the next election. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

A few years ago sheep farmers had limited access to an Australian manufactured footrot vaccine, called Custom R-Pilus, that was highly effective in reducing and managing footrot, but its use was discontinued by the APVMA. It was also cheaper and much more effective than the single overseas manufactured vaccine now available to Australian farmers to manage this debilitating disease, which costs the industry more than $83 million a year. Will the minister please explain why the Australian manufactured vaccine is no longer available to Australian sheep farmers?</span>

I will get some further details specifically on that. I understand that we are talking in relation to the APVMA as an independent regulator that administers a scientifically rigorous, risk based regulatory system for ag and veterinary chemicals. We have confidence that the APVMA decisions are based on the best available science to improve safety outcomes for Australians.

I'm also informed that a process to fully register the Australian vaccine is facing significant delays, and that this farmer's pleas to the minister and the Prime Minister have gone unanswered.

Minister, a few weeks ago APRA ordered Cbus and BUSSQ super to review their governance arrangements, given recent allegations of serious misconduct within the CFMEU, which is a shareholder of both Cbus's trustee, United Super, and BUSSQ. Minister, does the government think it's appropriate for the CFMEU to remain a shareholder in superannuation entities controlling over $100 billion in members' savings?</span>

And, if it's industry super he can attack, then he'll go after them.

On 29 August the CFMEU administrator, Mark Irving KC, forced all three of the CFMEU appointed trustees off the Cbus board. CFMEU appointed directors still make up half the eight-member BUSSQ board, and BUSSQ recently launched a federal court challenge to APRA's request that they conduct a review of their own arrangements, describing the licensee conditions as unreasonable. Will the government take action so that fund members can be better served by more independent directors on super fund boards rather than them being controlled by unions; and, if not, why not?</span>

They need to ensure that superannuation funds meet the highest standards of governance and act in the best interests of their members, and the independent regulator has the mandate to uphold these standards. Your question, and the fact that you have referred to APRA, shows that we have the system in place to manage concerns, and, if complaints or cases are raised, then APRA should respond to them. That's the system that this parliament has put in place. APRA, I think, has a very strong reputation in enforcing and upholding those standards, and I have no doubt they will continue to do so.</span>

Over the weekend I visited a group of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees protesting in the electorate of Tangney, grieving the death by suicide of 23-year-old Mano Yogalingam and calling for an end to mandatory offshore detention. The recent reports by the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre reveal the suffering of refugees held in offshore detention and subjected to uncertainty, medical neglect and trauma. On page 141 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">2023 Australian Labor Party platform</span>, there is a mandate to reintroduce the 90-day rule in the Migration Act. Independent MP Kylea Tink has introduced a refreshed private member's bill calling for a 90-day time limit on detention for people seeking asylum. Minister, will the government support Ms Tink's bill?</span>

Can I first say what an outstanding member of parliament Sam Lim, the member for Tangney, is. I am aware that there has been a pretty longstanding protest outside his office. The protest and the rally that Senator Payman was referring to has been occurring outside Mr Lim's office for quite some time, and I think it has been obstructing members of the public from obtaining services from that office, but I'm sure that that won't stop Mr Lim from doing the excellent job that he has been doing as a representative member in the electorate of Tangney.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also aware that many of the community members who have been at that protest are members of the Tamil community, and, of course, we respect their right to protest. I know that in at least some cases their protest activity has been motivated by the recent tragic suicide of a Tamil asylum seeker. Of course, it goes without saying that our thoughts are with the family and friends of that man who did take his life on 28 August.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have provided a visa pathway for thousands of people who were neglected by the former government. When we came to office, we understood that there were several thousand people who had gone through what was known as the fast-tracking process. Their asylum claims had not been properly dealt with and in many cases were rejected, but then they weren't given any security as to their future situation. They were told they couldn't stay in Australia, but they also weren't sent back to their originating countries, so they have been in limbo for more than a decade. This is one of the many challenges that we inherited from the former government in the immigration portfolio. Of course, it's now a matter of record that, when Mr Dutton oversaw that portfolio as home affairs minister, it was a broken system. That has been the finding of several reviews. The issues that Senator Payman is referring to are some that we're dealing with right now, and I know Minister Burke is giving it his full attention.</span>

The number was given by Senator Payman, and, of course, it's a very large number. But, since taking office a couple of years ago, our government has taken a different approach to this matter. We've provided resolution-of-status visas for anyone with a temporary protection or safe haven enterprise visa before 14 February 2023 and who has been found to be owed protection. This has provided a visa pathway for thousands of people neglected by the former government. Of the 6,352 people who were not found to be genuine refugees but are still lawfully in the community, only 167 are without work rights and access to Medicare. As I say, the Minister for Home Affairs, Minister Burke, is working through the failed fast-track cohort on a case-by-case basis. It's a large job to be done as part of fixing our broken migration system, but it's one that Minister Burke is committed to.</span>

Our government has taken a different approach to that of the former coalition government. As I say, we've provided resolution-of-status visas for anyone with a temporary protection visa or safe haven enterprise visa before 14 February 2023 who has been found to be owed protection. That is a very different approach to what was taken by the former government. It does remain an issue for many people in our community, and it's an issue that Minister Burke is working through.</span>

Minister, you've spoken before about the Albanese government's commitment to paid parental leave, a policy that Labor introduced and that is now expanding and modernising. Labor's commitment to PPL is also about valuing the important work of caring for babies, supporting families to share the care and reducing the long-term economic impact of time out of the workforce, especially for women. Can the minister please outline why the government is committed to paid parental leave and why adding superannuation to PPL is a priority?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we came to government, we had a long list of things that had been left undone or ignored relating to women in this country, and we started implementing changes and announcing new measures. One of those was about expanding paid parental leave, which the former Labor government brought in over a decade ago. It always takes Labor governments to do these important social changes that drive outcomes for women. We expanded that to 26 weeks by 2026, and we are seeing those increasing weeks come on board this year. We've introduced reserved leave for each parent. This will reach four weeks by the end of 2026, with the remaining week shared between parents however they may decide, and that's about making it flexible for families. An important part that we hadn't addressed was paying superannuation on paid parental leave. It was something that had been advocated for and campaigned about for years. It was the only employment condition that didn't have super paid on it, and we put that in place in this year's budget. It is due to come in on 1 July next year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important change to paid parental leave, and it's an important statement from the government about the value that we place on parents taking time out of the paid workforce to care for the next generations—whether it be the birth parents or the non-birth parents of those children. We want that condition to be flexible, but we don't want people to pay an additional penalty because they're doing that. This is work we value. It is important work, and we know that all the data shows women pay a penalty for taking time out for it.</span>

The Liberals will take any chance they can get to undermine the super system. We saw that in the pandemic, and they want to do it again for housing. How is this approach from the Liberals and the Nationals the latest attack on women's economic security?</span>

The Albanese government has lent to $100 million to Ampol for 200 battery-charging stations to expand electric vehicle fast-charging infrastructure nationwide. If, as Senator Wong claims, renewables are cheaper, why is it necessary for the Albanese government to give taxpayer funds to a company that recently reported a half-year profit of $235 million in order to subsidise electric vehicle charging stations?</span>

The thing is that those consumers are making a choice, and the choice that they are making requires them to have access to charging facilities. Under this government, we think that's important because we know that when you purchase an EV there are substantial savings available to you on fuel. And it's why, under this government, the number of EV charging locations has nearly doubled in 16 months to around 900 as of March 2024. We've also seen a 131 per cent increase in ultrafast charging locations.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to make sure that existing industries, businesses and stations are part of that transition. We announced in August, as your question points out, that CEFC capital will be available to finance a range of clean energy technology measures at Ampol service stations across the country, and that is to accelerate the decarbonisation of its operations, to kickstart its biofuel development and to drive down national transport emissions. The thing that you need to understand, Senator Rennick, is that all of these CEFC investments are made with the expectation of a positive, risk based financial return.</span>

                  </a>  We are in a period of very significant technological change across a range of fronts, and this is one of them. The National Electric Vehicle Strategy is this government's response to that. It's a pathway to cut our transport emissions, but it also has three objectives which are relevant to the question that you ask. The first is to increase the supply of affordable and accessible EVs, the second is to increase the resources, systems and infrastructure to enable rapid electric vehicle uptake and the third is to encourage increased EV demand. Part of that is thinking about waste. I encourage you to go and take a look at the strategy, have a look at the appraisal and have a look at the measures that are being proposed and set out in that strategy.</span>

It's also the case, more broadly, that lithium batteries are an increasing feature of our economy. It's not just electric vehicles where lithium batteries are used; they're used in a whole range of products. There are a range of things that we do need to do as a community to make sure that the technology is being used safely.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">To hear this government talk about inflation, you'd think that their fight against it is going well. They're fond of quoting the inflationary figure when they came to office. In June 2022, Australia's inflation figure, at an annualised rate, was 6.1 per cent. But, at the same time, in the eurozone it was 8.6 per cent. In the United States, it was 9.1 per cent. In Canada, it was 8.1 per cent. So when the Labor government came to office, inflation in Australia was lower than benchmarked advanced economies around the world—several percentage points lower.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the picture today: inflation in Australia is 3.5 per cent annualised, higher if you look at core inflation, but in the eurozone it's 2.2 per cent; in the United States, it's 2.9 per cent; and in Canada, it's 2.5 per cent. Inflation was several points lower than other advanced economies when the coalition left office. Now, with Labor in government, two years later, it's several points higher. This is why interest rates are higher in Australia than they need to be, because the government is not getting control of inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard the Minister representing the Treasurer say, 'Our economic plan is supporting economic growth.' But the only thing supporting economic growth in this country is immigration running at record highs. We are in a per-capita real GDP recession. We have now had six negative quarters of real GDP per capita growth. That's the largest per capita recession in Australia in 50 years. Real net disposable income per person—this is a measure of how well off or otherwise people feel—is down 8.6 per cent over the past 18 months. So if you wonder why people feel poorer, why households are complaining about the cost of living, this is why: because there is no economic plan from the Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen a collapse in productivity. It's down by 6.3 per cent. And we've seen that the only economic measure this government has is an expansion of the public sector. Of the 209,000 new jobs created in the first six months of this year, 2024, one in two of them were public sector jobs, or in the non-market sector. In a normally functioning economy, that would be one in seven. Instead, it was one in two.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also heard from the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs, Senator Watt, who claimed that industrial disruption was at an all-time low. In fact, under this Labor government there have been 36,700 days lost to industrial action every quarter. Compare that to the number during the coalition's nine years in office; it was 23,600. So days lost to industrial action is 50 per cent higher under Labor, the result of their sclerotic, union-friendly industrial relations regime they are forcing down the throats of Australian corporations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If households are wondering why they are feeling worse off, this is why—because their real incomes are not increasing and there is no productivity growth and no productivity agenda from this government. They are paying more in taxes because of bracket creep. This government is collecting record amounts of income tax, and their stage 3 tax cuts, even on their own forward estimates, are going to take more in receipts. You're paying more for your mortgage because interest rates are higher than they should be, despite countless warnings from the Reserve Bank that government spending is too high and keeping inflation higher than it needs to be. Despite all the evidence from economists, respected institutions and people in the financial markets, the government refuses to accept this and instead seeks to blame the Reserve Bank.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In other advanced economies around the world, central banks are cutting interest rates. The Bank of Canada is cutting interest rates. Eurozone is cutting interest rates. The Bank of England has cut interest rates. The US Federal Reserve is poised to cut interest rates. Only in Australia is the central bank, the Reserve Bank, saying that there are no interest rate cuts on the horizon and certainly not this year, because inflation is too high. As I said before, when this government came to office, it inherited inflation that was several percentage points lower than other advanced economies. It is now presiding over inflation that is several percentage points higher.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why people are paying more for a life's everyday essentials—because inflation in this country is out of control. This government does not have an economic plan to address the economic challenges facing Australia. They need to come up with one.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:07</span>):  If you had been overseas and not actually understood what had gone on in this country over the last decade, when those on that side were in government, you might believe some of that contribution, but we know the facts are very different. They were in government for almost 10 years and never delivered a surplus—not one. We've been in government for just over two years and have already delivered two surpluses. Even the RBA governor has made comment about the extent to which that has actually helped to reduce inflation in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You might want to come in and try and paint a very different picture, but people in Australia understand that, if inflation had a six in front of it and now has a three in front of it after two years, that is a downward trend. If you are that concerned about the cost of living for ordinary Australians, why is it that you have voted against every measure that this government has put forward? We know that, under Mr Dutton, there would be higher energy costs and tax cuts would not have been delivered at the rate that we have delivered them, because Australian taxpayers on average have got twice the tax cut under our government than they would have had if they were still in power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, when we put measures in place, like increased wages for Australian workers, you voted against them. You have voted against every single measure that we have put through this chamber to help with the cost of living for ordinary Australians. You voted against them. Every time you say no. So coming in here and bleating about inflation and what would have happened under you is not going to wash with the Australian people, because they see right through you. What did you do when we introduced cheaper medicines? You voted against it. When we introduced 60-day scripts, which will help people reduce the number of times they have to go to their GP and cost them less when they go to the pharmacy, what did those on that side do? They voted against it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every single opportunity those opposite in this place have to attack superannuation for Australian workers, they do it each and every time. Why do they do that? Why do they attack superannuation? Because, fundamentally, it's in their DNA not to support super for Australian workers. That's the reality of it. Why was it that, when they were in government for almost 10 years, their policy was to keep wages low? Because it's part of their DNA. On this side of the chamber, we will always support Australian workers. We believe in superannuation. We believe in access to Medicare. We haven't tried to tear it down, which is what they have done each and every time they've been in government. That's why Mr Dutton, when he was the Minister for Health, cut billions of dollars out of health each and every time—because they do not fundamentally believe in universal health care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All these things add to the cost of living. Whether it is increasing wages or making medicines cheaper, they have voted against it. They have voted against every measure we've tried to put in place through this chamber to help with the cost of living. When they actually make a contribution with their hand on their heart, trying to have the Australian people believe they really care about what they're going through with the cost of living, all the people have to do is look at their record of voting in this chamber. Each and every time—they never let them down—they vote no. Their great contribution to the energy debate and reducing the cost of energy for Australian households—22 policies when they were in government, and they couldn't even deliver one of them. And the one they want to try and deliver, if Mr Dutton ever becomes Prime Minister, will cost the Australian taxpayer billions and billions of dollars and not reduce their personal energy bills by one cent. That's the reality, that's the truth and they're the facts that need to be put on the record, which I'm happy to do.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to take note, following Senator Sharma's very wide motion alluding to all the answers to questions, in relation to Senator McAllister's answer to the question in relation to the McPhillamys gold project. I want to put this in context for the people listening to this debate. There is a dispute at the moment with respect to Minister Plibersek, in her capacity as environment minister, exercising powers under section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, refusing approval for a $1 billion gold project called the McPhillamys gold project in regional New South Wales. In defending that decision, Minister Plibersek went on ABC <span style="font-style:italic;">AM</span>:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">a wonderful journalist—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">just a couple of years ago, the previous Environment Minister, the Deputy Leader of the Liberals, Sussan Ley, made a very similar decision just down the road, about 50 kilometres away in Bathurst.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, when this was referred to earlier in the week, I assumed—in good faith—that Minister Plibersek was actually referring to a material project—a project comparable to a $1 billion gold project, but she was in fact referring to a go-kart track. It never even occurred to me that the comparison that Minister Plibersek was drawing was one that sought to conflate a decision made in relation to a $1 billion gold project with one in relation to a go-kart track. That was not disclosed by the minister when the minister made that comment on ABC <span style="font-style:italic;">AM</span>. There is a reason, when you give evidence in court, that you've got to take an oath that you're going to give the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth—the whole truth, and that was not disclosed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at section 10(1)(d) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, it says that the minister must consider 'such other matters as he or she thinks relevant'. I say to the Australian people: how about these for relevant matters that should have been considered by the minister—the hundreds of jobs that would have been provided in regional Australia by this $1 billion project? How can you compare that and say it's a similar decision to one in relation to a go-kart track? How about a major project of this size acting as a foundation stone for the local regional community?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These projects have economic consequences that go beyond the fence of the project and could provide jobs and support for small businesses, for NGOs, for students to go to local schools et cetera. How about the hundreds of millions of dollars of royalties that would be generated by this gold project? There are at least 10 million ounces of gold in the ore body that this project would have mined, and now those hundreds of millions of dollars of royalties are forgone. How about the $192 million that had already been invested in relation to this project when it got to this late approval stage? Seven years! How can you possibly, in good faith, compare that to a go-kart track?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, what about sovereign risk? The most disturbing thing about this decision is that it says to mining companies all over the world that you could come to this country and spend $192 million of capital, get to the end of that process and then have the rug pulled from under you. It's an absolute disgrace.</span>

Looking at the cost of living in our country, we have a shadow Treasurer who is so out of touch with the needs of our country that he calls substantial cost-of-living relief 'manipulation'. Fancy that—manipulation! And we have, coming from the opposition, policies that would pull the rug out of our economy at the very worst possible time. Indeed, at a time when we have an economy that is barely growing, it is absolute economic insanity to slash and burn as the opposition would have government do at this time.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some $315 billion worth of cuts would leave our economy in a critical condition. Meanwhile, we know they also had on their agenda—which we have undone and which eventually they, sensibly, voted for—tax cuts that they had targeted at the very highest income earners in our nation. Had we not delivered the redistribution of those tax cuts, we would have left the Australian economy and household incomes in a dire, dire plight. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an opposition that does not want to fight inflation. You are here, day after day, to fight your ideological battle with us for your own electoral purposes, but, in doing so, you are fighting against the interests of the Australian people. You don't want to help Australians; you want Australians to get hurt and have a hard landing so you can manipulate it for electoral purposes. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You've left us with debt and deficit as far as the eye can see, and now you want to bring forth cuts and chaos on the Australian people. We, the Labor government, are committed to doing the hard work of getting the balance right. I'm proud to be part of those efforts and to see our ministers working hard day after day to balance our books and get our policies right. Meaningful, substantial cost-of-living relief that helps everyone in the fight against inflation is not there to smash what is—as we all acknowledge—an already soft economy. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know inflation is higher than we'd like, but it is less than half of its peak and is much lower than what we inherited from the coalition. At the election just two years ago, inflation had a six in front of it; now it's come down to have a three in front of it. We know we've got more work to do, but it's good to see that underlying inflation has moderated and we now have momentum towards inflationary pressures heading downward. That is a good achievement. We are pushing in the right direction. Of course we'd love it to be faster, but you're not helping. You're not doing the work to push inflation down; all you're doing is pointing the finger. Monthly inflation has hit a four-month low. Our budget strategy is helping in the fight against inflation, not hampering it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, fiscal policy isn't the primary determinant of prices in our economy, but our decisions in the budget and as a government are here to help—and they are helping. We want to be, and indeed we are, a government that, day after day, in the last budget, this budget, and the next budget, takes the edge off inflation. That's why we've delivered back-to-back surpluses— </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:23</span>):  That was a lacklustre question time, if ever there was one, from the government for vested interests. Our questions this afternoon were about the issues that are important to the Australian people in relation to the cost of living: interest rates, taxation policy and superannuation policy. These are the things that impact Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To hear Senator Pratt say that these are not the issues that impact the Australian people is actually quite offensive. The reality is that interest rates are stubbornly high in Australia because there is a massive inflation problem in this country which comparable nations are not having to deal with. Inflation is running so high because of public sector spending. Labor can't say no to their favourite vested interests. They keep on spending taxpayer funds, which is making the inflation problem so much worse, and households and small businesses are getting smashed. It is outrageous for Dr Chalmers, the Treasurer, to say that the Reserve Bank is smashing the Australian people. It is him and his government, through their lacklustre fiscal policy, who are smashing the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Taxes are up. That is also eroding the household budgets of the Australian people. One of the things that this parliament will live to regret is the reinsertion of a tax bracket that was abolished by the last parliament. Who would have believed we would turn back the clock and put a tax bracket back in place? That that has happened has locked in bracket creep in the long term. There will be more and more bracket creep and Commonwealth budgets will be riding high on stealing people's income to pay for surpluses and the like here in Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is offering nothing for small business—absolutely nothing. There is nothing in relation to cutting regulation or taxes or doing things like accelerated depreciation. It is no wonder that business investment is flatlining and the economy is turning sour. The government could do things like cut regulation and taxes, and until they do that, I fear we are heading for the rocks. The central charge against this government is that it is a government for vested interests. It only works hard for the unions and the special interests like the super funds and can't bring itself to work hard on inflation or on things like housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the other part of this very revealing question time was that the government is against choice. On the question on paid parental leave, it was very clear that the government thinks it's a bad idea for new parents to be given access to their own money and they want it locked away for 40 years in a superannuation fund. Now, anyone who has had children would know that, when you have children, you need to buy nappies. Nappies are more important than superannuation when you have children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea that the government would deny people choice and access to their own money shows how paternalistic this government is and how they believe that the Australian people are too stupid to save for their own retirement. There is no rule that says the only way you can save for retirement is through the Labor Party's favourite superannuation scheme. There are other ways to do it. Australians know how to pay a mortgage. They know how to tighten the belt when the going gets hard. So the idea that the Australian people are too stupid and need to have all this paternalistic policy is, frankly, very offensive. But it is revealing that this is the character of the modern Labor Party. It has such a low view of the Australian people: that they are too stupid to save for their own retirement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is not our policy, nor is it our position. We think that the Australian people are smart enough to make their own judgements, and if they want to put their money into superannuation, that's fine. If they want to put their money into their own living expenses, that's fine. If they want to negatively gear to provide an investment property for someone else, that's fine. It is our view that people are smart enough to look after themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So that is the choice that is coming for the Australian people next year—or maybe later this year. I assume it will be next year. It will be a choice between, on one side, a party and coalition that is in favour of empowering people to make their own judgements about their own lives and seeks to support small business and, on the other side, the Labor Party that thinks the Australian people are too stupid to make their own judgements, has no interest in helping small business to invest and to grow and is locked into a corporatist, unionist mindset such that it thinks that the function of government is to funnel money and policy in favour of special interests. This is a sickness and a cancer on the Australian polity, and it shows that Alfred Deakin was right 100 years ago when he said that Labor's problem was that it was beholden to vested interests. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I started this week on Monday morning with a contribution on the maugean skate, following an editorial in a Tasmanian newspaper, the<span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Advocate</span>. The editor had made some comments, and I think it's fair to say I was furious when I read those comments. The editor had commented that, while he might find it unfortunate if 'that damned fish', the maugean skate, went extinct, it's not something he would lose sleep over. I've reflected on my comments on Monday morning and my fury, and something has occurred to me. To give Mr Haneveer credit, at least he spoke what he believed to be the truth. He said out loud the quiet thing that a lot of decision-makers haven't been prepared to say, which is that they really don't give a rat's arse about a species that's likely to go extinct.</span>

                  </a>  They really don't care that a species is on the edge of extinction. I haven't heard any concern from any of the politicians in this chamber who support the salmon industry in Tasmania about the fact that this ancient creature that's been with us since the time of the dinosaurs is on the edge of extinction, based on all the best science that we have. As surely as the sun rises in the morning, if we don't care that a creature is about to become extinct, especially when we're leaders—whether the editor of a newspaper or a politician—then it will become extinct. It's 100 per cent sure it will become extinct. </span>

Where do we draw the line when we've got 2½ thousand endangered species in this country alone?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's great that we had politicians going to Minister Plibersek's session out the front here for endangered species. It's good that they can choose to connect with an animal, and I hope that they do when they go along. Of course, it's those charismatic animals that we tend to love and talk to our friends about. But there is such a broad array of wonderful creatures in this country that are on the edge of extinction. It's absolutely critical that we understand that what these 2½ thousand or so endangered creatures in Australian habitats, and other endangered creatures—and there are many more of them around the world—all have in common is that we can link them to a decision of government.</span>

I wanted to see if the government cared about the maugean skate, and I'm none the wiser from today's answers. I asked why it's taken 221 days for the government to make a decision on this. I know senators across the chamber, like Senator Duniam, also would like the minister to hurry up. Of course, they're champing at the bit for her to hurry up so they can farm more salmon and push the skate to the brink of extinction. I'd like them to be honest about that. If they don't care about the extinction of a species, they should come out and say it, as Mr Haneveer did. At least say the quiet thing out loud. That way, people know and understand just what we're up against.</span>

That way, they can vote. That way, they can lobby their local members of parliament to actually do something about this, because politicians have it in their hands if they choose to act. It is that simple. We can protect nature now by making the right decisions and getting some decent environment laws and a whole range of other things.

                    </a>  Senator Paterson's motion highlights the lack of trust in our security agencies the opposition has demonstrated throughout the debate on this issue. The opposition is recklessly asking the government to table advice from our intelligence and security agencies in relation to the Middle East. We've acted in accordance with the advice of our security agencies on this issue. The personnel and the processes that underline that advice remain the same as when the opposition were in office. Rather than engaging on the cost of living, the Liberals seek to drive fear and division in our community.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Paterson has talked of a social cohesion crisis. These types of motions and the coalition's dog whistling are what is causing it. We urge the crossbench to send a message to the opposition that enough is enough. Leave our intelligence and border agencies to do what they do best, which is to keep us safe. Our visa processes are strong. The system has multiple checks built into it, and referrals can be made at any point. This is the same visa system that existed under those opposite.</span>

                    </a>  Okay, thank you. I understand it suits the convenience of the Senate for the deferred vote to be held now. As Senator Lambie has indicated to the chamber, she wishes to vote differently on part of the motion, so I'll put the question on the entire motion except for (f). The question is that the motion moved by Senator Rennick, relating to a proposed reference to a committee—minus (f), as asked for by Senator Lambie—be agreed to.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This situation should never have arisen. International students should never have been used as cash cows. But here we are because of the short-sightedness of governments. And now they want to slash and burn, with no plans on how the shortfall of funds will be met. This is just plain disastrous. Labor is holding the sector hostage by telling them they will get rid of the crappy MD107 if these caps are in place. This is a choice between two evils. It is a no-win situation, and I'm glad people can see right through this and are fighting back because their livelihoods, their profession and the future of education in this country are on the line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will tell you that this is all about ensuring quality and integrity. But 70 submissions and three hearings later, no-one is able to tell me that caps have anything to do with quality or integrity. And let me tell you about how Labor has made a complete mockery of the Senate inquiry process itself. They released the university cap numbers the day after our original final hearing. When we pushed for a further hearing, the government published caps for the VET sector while we were in that hearing. The government knows they don't have a leg to stand on, so they want to avoid any scrutiny. Well, we're not going to let that happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Evidence shows gaping holes, perverse outcomes, uncertainties, inconsistencies and a complete lack of consultation. These are just some of the flaws that make the whole policy and its process a complete catastrophe. This is a hot mess. The more details that are forced out of the government, the messier this train  wreck gets. Not only are the Labor government intent on decimating the sector; they have absolutely zero regard for the harm they are doing to international students by making them scapegoats for their own policy failures and blaming them for the housing crisis—just disgraceful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">International students pay massive fees. They work here doing the jobs no-one else does. They bring vibrancy, diversity and culture. They keep unis and the economy going. And you have the audacity to scapegoat and demonise them. I am loath to frame education as an export sector, because for me it is a public good and a pursuit of knowledge. But the reality is that it is the second-highest export, mining being the first. If anything, it should be climate-wrecking coal and gas that you should be capping, not international student numbers. And if Labor really cares about tertiary education then fully fund it; wipe student debt, make uni and TAFE free, scrap the Job-ready Graduates Package and give staff job security. Don't come to the table with half-cooked rubbish policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is hell-bent on strangling the sector in their bullish attempt to achieve a migration outcome that has absolutely nothing to do with international students' education. The Liberals don't have clean hands, either. Both have the same racist playbook on migrants. The tertiary education sector, their staff and their students are becoming collateral damage in this shameful racist race to the bottom between Labor and the Liberals on migration.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Albanese knows how to backflip. It's time he backflips on these reckless, irrational and illogical caps. It's time to go back to the drawing board and come back with an education bill, not a migration policy.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HENDERSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  I rise to firstly place clearly on the record that the coalition vehemently disagrees with the Greens about the need for caps on international students studying in Australia. I also have real issue with the way you've characterised the Liberals, Senator Faruqi—the reference of the word 'racist' is appalling—and I would ask, through you, Chair, that you consider withdrawing such a slur on the Liberal Party, because we have a very proud history of supporting international education in this country. We have a very a proud history of supporting a great multicultural country, but the capping of foreign student numbers is critical to fixing Labor's immigration chaos.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since Labor was elected, the number of foreign students has increased from 336,000 in March 2022 to well over 800,000. This has fuelled a housing crisis, particularly in large metropolitan centres. As we heard during our Senate inquiry into the bill, 500,000 foreign students have been forced into the private rental market. In the suburb of Glebe, near the University of Sydney, where foreign students now number 52 per cent of all students, rents have gone up by 17 per cent in just 12 months. In Clayton, which is the home of Monash University, rents are up a staggering 20 per cent in 12 months. By bringing in 1.6 million migrants into Australia over five years, Labor's 'big Australia' policy has completely failed to safeguard the national interest, including the right to find an affordable home, see a doctor and access other essential services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I will agree with the Greens on this. The government has made a complete mess of its proposal to cap international student numbers, and I am disgusted. I share Senator Faruqi's disgust with the way in which the government has treated this parliament and the higher education sector. In the Senate hearings that we have had into the bill, the government has done everything it possibly can to keep the actual student caps provided to each higher education and VET provider a secret. Even last Friday, after we said very strongly that we opposed the way the government was treating the parliament and the sector, they were still keeping all the separate international student caps secret from the Senate committee. That is completely unacceptable. Labor has made a real mockery of the Senate inquiry process. What we do know is that, of the provider caps that have now been given to the sector, the total allocation for universities has gone backwards by one per cent. But we understand that across the private higher education and VET sectors it has gone back by 28 per cent. So we are seeing gross discrimination at play.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister, when he announced these caps, said this was a win for the regions. We've now learned, through the Senate inquiry, that this is not a win for the regions. A number of regional universities have done very badly out of these caps, because the government have basically gone about imposing these caps without any transparency and have been doing deals behind closed doors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are, as a committee, seeking to extend the reporting date of the committee. We're also seeking to reopen submissions and have another public hearing, because the way the government is treating this whole issue, including the sector, is absolutely not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will implement a hard cap on the international student program in consultation with the higher education sector, which is what has been missing. International students contribute to the Australian economy. They provide valuable labour by working in casual and part-time jobs. However, the vast majority of international students are housed off-campus. This is placing enormous pressure on housing. There is a housing crisis courtesy of this government. That is not good enough. We need a system that manages this properly. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  We have, in the international education sector, an economic and social contribution to our nation that is incredibly important. It's important for those students in their future lives abroad and indeed for those who might progress to migrating to Australia. But we are progressing reforms, as a government, to strengthen the integrity and sustainability of international education in our nation. I've got many dear friends all over the world who I met as international students, and they form such a firm foundation for government-to-government and community-to-community relationships right around the world. But, following the pandemic, international students were in grave strife, often trapped without incomes et cetera. We had to work hard to come back from that. But international students have indeed voted with confidence in Australian education and have come back stronger than anyone expected. We have about 10 per cent more in our universities and almost 50 per cent more in our VET sector. But when we look at what the government is actually doing now—at the new limits that have been set out transparently to university institutions, for example—we'll see 23 of our 38 universities set above the 2023 student numbers and, for 34 of the 38 universities, above the levels of student numbers that they had in 2019.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we don't want to see is what has happened, which is that the growth of the sector post the COVID pandemic has lured back unscrupulous providers, who are motivated by profit, not quality. It has lured students to Australia who seek to work in Australia, not to study. We are as a government determined to commit ourselves and continue to remain committed to the integrity of the sector, strengthening the sector and ensuring it retains and maintains a social licence so that we can confidently invite international students here and know that they will be welcome. We need this experience to benefit students and our partners overseas but also Australians. We need reform to ensure sustainable growth into the future. So, subject to the passage of legislation before the Senate, we are intending to set a national planning level for overseas student commencements at a rate of 270,000 for the calendar year of 2025.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NPL will support a managed international education system designed to grow sustainably over time. We can't have a system of international education that sets housing economies and employment markets completely out of whack. We need to be careful about how we balance higher education and VET sectors, for example. For publicly funded universities, the managed-growth approach, in aggregate, will result in around 145,000 new overseas student commencements in 2025, which is very close to last year's number. For other providers, in aggregate, their new overseas student commencements in 2025 will be around 30,000. That is about the same as student numbers were before the pandemic. That is where they should be, because that is where a quality VET service to international students was seen. We've got to cut out sham providers and people seeking to come to Australia simply to access the labour market. We will, though, see around— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Let's be honest: it's to keep foreign students' numbers uncapped. This motion shows the Greens' disregard and contempt for Australian families experiencing homelessness and mortgage stress. As always, the Greens are putting the interests of foreigners before the interests of the Australian people and Australian university students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were more than 810,000 international student enrolments in Australian universities as of May this year. That's more than the entire population of Tasmania and the Northern Territory combined. These same universities, which make billions of dollars a year from international education, make insufficient provision to house all these students. Last year it was reported that international students took up about 70 per cent of available rental accommodation in Australia. That's an appalling figure when so many Australian people are struggling with rental vacancy rates in mainland capital cities that have fallen to under one per cent. International students are also affecting the quality of education for Australian students, who are being left behind. So many of them cannot speak English and sit in lectures and seminars with their phones translating for them or get lectures in Mandarin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens must learn a simple fact: record immigration and international student numbers are hurting this country while the Greens advocate for more immigration, more refugees and, now, more international students. Australia owes nothing to foreigners that it does not first owe to Australian citizens. In fact, our universities, built and funded by Australian taxpayers, cost approximately $20 billion to $25 billion a year, and that includes student loans. They are classified as charities and don't pay tax. We have the bull by the horns if we now believe foreign students are more important than Aussies when it comes to educational and living standards. As for Senator McKim, he is trying to use foreign students to prop up the University of Tasmania, regardless of the impact on housing, while rents in Tasmania have doubled and vacancy rates in Hobart have fallen to less than 1½ per cent.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  I, too, rise to speak on this matter of urgency moved by Senator McKim, and on one thing we agree: the value of Australia's international education sector. It is a vital part of our economy, and international students are a valuable part of our communities. That's why it's important that we progress reforms that strengthen the sector's integrity and sustainability. Such reforms will ensure that students have a brilliant experience in Australia and go on to be proud ambassadors for our country and our values when they return home. I want to make it absolutely clear that our government is committed to this sector and its future. That's why, subject to the passage of legislation which is currently before the Senate, the government will set a national planning level for new overseas student commencements of 270,000 for 2025, divided between the higher education and the VET sectors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the pandemic, international enrolment numbers have surged more strongly than anyone expected and, unfortunately, some of these enrolments are people who seek to work in Australia, not study. That needs to happen through the appropriate pathways. We have also clearly seen a resurgence of unscrupulous operators who are focused on profit over delivering quality education. That leads to bad outcomes for students—students whom we want to have an amazing and transformative experience in our education system; students whom, as I said, we want to return to their countries with nothing but positivity and share with others about their time in Australia and the education that they received here. That's why the government has taken these measures to deliver sustainable growth for our international education system into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This policy will ensure that students coming to Australia can be confident that they are investing in a high-quality education and study experience. Since the pandemic we have seen that the previous, unmanaged system presented unacceptable risks to the quality of international education received by students and that it would ultimately undermine the strength of our sector and its reputation internationally. The government has released indicative international student profiles, using a transparent formula that has been designed to ensure that regional universities, in particular, whose enrolments have generally not returned to prepandemic levels, have room to recover from the pandemic and continue to grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These proposals do not decimate the sector, as this motion claims. They do not cut enrolments by 90 per cent or any of the other misleading numbers that members of this chamber have claimed. The fact is that, overall, public universities will be able to take roughly the same number of new students next year as they did last year. For publicly funded universities, our government's approach will result in around 145,000 new overseas student commencements in 2025, which is close to last year's number.</span>

We are trying to do so in a way which advances and supports a quality international education offering and which leads to a positive experience for students when they come to Australia. We're also doing what we can to support those students in Australia for whom university is the pathway that they prefer, that they choose and that they seek to have a transformational benefit from—for Australian students to be able to go to university—and we're supporting them to do so by wiping $3 billion in student debt for more than three million Australians.</span>

We're already progressing this work by committing to suburban hubs and regional university study hubs and expanding access for First Nations students in particular. I visited a number of these student hubs around regional South Australia. They offer a huge benefit to students who wish to further their education but do so in a way where they can stay at home, continue studying at home and continue doing their prac placements at home.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  The Senate committee inquiry into the government's Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Quality and Integrity) Bill 2024, or ESOS, has heard overwhelming evidence of a bill that has been rushed, poorly drafted and poorly consulted on and which presents serious risks to the higher education sector, including the already record low research funding levels, as well as the economy more broadly. That's not to say that the government's objectives are wrong. The integrity measures are welcome and much needed. There is a genuine issue in some courses in some organisations with an over enrolment of international students leading to poor student outcomes. No-one can deny that housing affordability is one of the biggest issues we face. A strategy for immigration—how big Australia gets—is needed. I believe that is something Australians want, but this bill, as drafted, doesn't deal with those issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a range of sensible amendments that could make this legislation more workable, but there must be a delay in implementation. It is getting so close to the start of the next university year. We simply cannot risk the reputational damage from rescinding offers that are already out there—that students are planning for next year. We can't risk the hit to the economy from slowing too quickly our biggest non-mining export industry. I cannot see how government and higher education providers can possibly be in a position to implement this in a matter of months. We need to delay the start date, put a safety net and a buffer around the caps, provide a process to challenge individual caps and sunset the extraordinary powers that this bill gives the minister.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

Not a week goes by without this place being dependent on the work of social scientists: their research and their training of people who inform all of our work in this place. High-quality, accessible education serves the public good and should be adequately funded by governments. Students should have fee-free access to a safe and effective learning environment, and staff need secure jobs and pay. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Inadequate public funding and the gradual corporatisation of Australian universities has eroded the quality of research, teaching and employment. The future of public university hangs in the balance, and this cap on international students will only make things worse—much worse. Rather than address the structural issue of chronic university underfunding, this government would rather scapegoat international students and blame them for the housing and cost-of-living crises. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian universities have been chronically underfunded for decades. The structural crises in university funding and workforce reflect decades of punitive restructuring and underfunding, and they pushed deregulation and privatisation that's been underway in our sector since the mid-1980s. Federal funding for universities between 1995 and 2021 declined by $6.5 billion. That equates to almost half of current higher education funding. In addition, Australian universities are experiencing an epidemic of insecure and casualised employment. It's been going on for years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If this bill is passed, it will put a further 14,000 university jobs at risk, according to the sector. I know what this means for research and the quality of teaching in our Australian higher education system. Make no mistake: this is an appalling migration policy masquerading as an education policy. This bill is a political smokescreen that the government hopes will give it an upper hand in its political battle with Peter Dutton on migration ahead of the next election. This is wrong on so many counts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">International students accounted for more than half of Australia's GDP growth last year, almost single-handedly saving the nation from recession. International students are more than numbers or commodities; they bring culture and vibrancy to our cities, towns and campuses. International students pay astronomical fees, yet too often face bias, discrimination and racism. In my home state of South Australia, international education is the largest export sector. In 2023 it was worth over $3 billion to our state economy, and our community in South Australia would be so much worse off on so many counts without our international graduates. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the hearings about the international student caps, the Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the University of Adelaide, Professor Jennie Shaw, said, 'The imposition of caps endangers the future prosperity of South Australia.' The president of the Flinders University Student Association also said that the government's measures over the past 12 months have left international students feeling completely dehumanised. There was universal opposition to this chaotic and reckless bill at the inquiry hearings.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The higher education sector will be collateral damage in this race to the bottom and race to the Right on migration between Labor and the Liberals. The government must scrap the caps and immediately get rid of ministerial direction 107. They must go back to the drawing board. They must genuinely consult with the higher education sector and restore public funding to these critical institutions which are so important to the economic, social and cultural health and richness of our country. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise the great achievements of the Australian cattle industry. It's an industry that has existed in this country from pretty much the inception of European settlement here in Australia. In fact, the First Fleet brought over the first herd, so to speak—four cows and two bulls. They were put out to pasture on Bennelong Point, where the Sydney Opera House now stands. It didn't go so well because they escaped from that area within weeks, and the first settlers lost them. But it was actually a happy circumstance because around 20 years later they found this herd of cattle south of Sydney that had flourished; hundreds of cows had bred and naturally grazed on Australian pasture lands. There was no human development, no clearing of land; it was just a natural place where cows could survive and ultimately build the cattle industry we have. I remember being at a meeting in Normanton where Fred Pascoe, a great Indigenous leader, spoke about how the cattle industry is now part of his people's culture. He is part-owner, with other Indigenous leaders, of the Delta Downs cattle station in the Gulf of Carpentaria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cattle industry is part of our country's heritage and history, and it's why there's been such a reaction from the industry to the attempt of another nation's government—another colonial power—to take over and dictate what Australian graziers should do on their own lands and properties, including Indigenous Australians who run their own cattle properties now. The European Union, a few years ago, introduced a new set of regulations called the deforestation regulations. They cover a range of products, but the one I'm focusing on is beef. In short, those regulations mean that in areas of Australia that the EU deems forest land we will not be able to raise, graze and ultimately produce beef from cattle. If any cow sets foot in an area the European Union deems forested area, it won't be able to be exported as a beef product or other animal product to the EU. I think this is gross overreach into the sovereignty of another nation. It should be the job of an elected representative body either here in Canberra or at state level to decide how our land is regulated in such a detailed way. But you also, of course, get the normal problems when other governments—on the other side of the world, in this case—seek to dictate what should be best for the environment and for agricultural production in a part of the world they obviously know very little about. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The European Union's regulations have a number of challenges for our graziers. Those regulations dictate that, of any area that has a canopy of five metres or above, over 10 per cent is deemed forest land. Consistent with my example from the First Fleet, a lot of our pastoral lands have not been cleared. They are naturally part of the environment already available for cattle grazing, even with a large amount of woodlands on them. It's very different from the European situation, where they have very thick forests and, to graze cattle, they have to clear those forests. That's not necessarily the case in Australia, where there is lots of downs country that is naturally formed in that way, or it has been slightly cleared over time but it's been part of our practice to do that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Europeans have put out maps of the forest areas that they reckon exist in Australia. They've taken it upon themselves to map our own country. That area covers 144 million hectares, not far off the size of Victoria, and 44 per cent of the green blotches the EU have on their map are actually grazing lands in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There remain huge issues with the implementation of the EU regulations. They haven't finalised the country-benchmarking scheme. There is no clarity for our beef industry on how they would comply with these regulations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason we're moving this motion is to respectfully ask the European Union to look again at these regulations and to defer their implementation. We're not the only country in this boat, asking for a deferral. We ask that they look properly at this issue and not seek to overregulate another part of the world that they don't really understand, understandably, which will only actually worsen environmental outcomes here in Australia and cause economic damage to the relationship that we have with our friends in Europe. We should work together on these issues, not seek to pass laws against each other's nations, ignorant of the facts on the ground.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Assistant Minister for Education, Assistant Minister for Regional Development and Deputy Manager of Government Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:47</span>):  I thank Senator Canavan for that contribution and also for working constructively with Senator Ciccone on this motion, because this is an important issue for our country and for our cattle industry and beef producers in particular. As a Queensland senator I understand the importance of the cattle industry to my state, and, in my new role as Assistant Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, I have enjoyed the engagements I've had with the cattle industry across Australia at the same time. It is an issue that is important to our economy, but it's also important to many regional places. I was in Cloncurry and Mount Isa last week, and it was a topic that came up for discussion amongst the mayors and community members that I engaged with whilst I was in that part of the world, which obviously has a really proud history in terms of beef cattle, particularly the export trade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This specific issue is important. It is something that the government are taking seriously, and we understand the role that we have to play in supporting our industry in this country. We are committed to combating deforestation, and we understand the European Union's concerns about the rate of deforestation globally. Like the European Union, we understand the critical importance of forest biodiversity and sustainable land use. The European Union is a close trading partner of Australia's, and we look forward to working with them on areas of mutual interest. As Senator Canavan said, that is something that we have a strong history on in the past and that we would seek to continue on this matter. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is committed to halting and reversing net forest loss and land degradation by 2030. Australia and the European Union are both signatories to the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use, the Forest &amp; Climate Leaders' Partnership and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. We have a well-established institutional framework to support the conservation and sustainable management of forests. However, we are concerned about the complexity and regulatory burden that the European Union Deforestation Regulation will place on our agricultural exporters, in a market that already has high costs of entry—a concern that is shared strongly by industry. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we have continued to do since coming into government, we will support and advocate for our agriculture sector when it comes to arbitrary measures imposed by trading partners. The Albanese Labor government has undertaken significant advocacy with the European Commission on the European Union deforestation regulation since forming government. These steps have included a submission on Australia's forest status provided to the European Commission on 30 June 2023 supporting our advocacy for a low-risk-country rating. On 6 May 2024 Senator Watt, in his former capacity as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, wrote to the European Union environment commissioner calling for a delay of commencement beyond 30 December 2024 and outlining a range of issues with the European Union deforestation regulation, including a lack of clarity, slow development of European Union information technology systems and insufficient preparedness among member state competent authorities, all of which could potentially have an adverse impact on Australia's agriculture trade.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been a range of government officials meetings and exchanges of correspondence with European Unions counterparts to seek clarity on specific destinational issues to ensure that the European Union understands Australia's agriculture and forest management practices, including our national forest maps, to increase the accuracy of the European Union global forest cover dataset, although the European Commission confirmed that they are preparing additional formal guidance for trading partners with respect to agricultural use, grazing intensity and frequency, set-aside land and plantation forest, among other topics that Australia has raised with them directly. We are still waiting, and our advocacy will continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government continues to engage with the European Union on the regulation to seek clarity and to support our agricultural industry's efforts to comply with the regulation. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry recently completed work to assess the implication for Australia's trade, which involved industry stakeholder engagement, in-depth trade analysis and ongoing engagement with the union. Separately, we continue to work closely with like-minded countries to raise specific concerns about the European Union deforestation regulation, including with the WTO. We are supporting Australian led industry initiatives to respond to the European regulation, including an ag trace project led by the Food Agility Cooperative Research Centre. We call on the European Union to delay implementation of the European Union deforestation regulation until the uncertainties around its implementation are resolved.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  Deforestation is a significant contributor to emissions and therefore to climate change. So, avoiding deforestation—in which Australia, sadly, is a world leader—is taking climate action. I expected that the LNP would bring on a motion like this, because they spent the last decade in government in this place doing whatever they could to undermine climate action. But I am surprised that the Labor Party would co-sign and join this motion. I'm not surprised about the timing. We had farmers here yesterday protesting, so the timing of this is no doubt designed to try to give the Labor Party some cover in trying to keep farmers on side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you a little bit about deforestation. Documents obtained by the Wilderness Society by freedom of information revealed that the government was seeking assurances from the EU in relation to its deforestation import regulation and that Australia ought to be considered a low risk for deforestation, because it claims that Australia has a robust environmental law that supports the protection and sustainable use of our forests. Well, Australia's environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, has described the environment law as broken and recognised that under these laws deforestation is a significant problem. So, which one is it?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The law is currently going through a supposed reform, and no doubt this is something we are going to be acting on. As the good senator from the government said, the Australian government is also a signatory to a global Glasgow leaders' declaration to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. There is a quote from the Wilderness Society that I really like, from Adele Chasson, Corporate Campaigner for the Wilderness Society:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The government can't seem to keep its story straight on Australia's deforestation problem. The Australian government is telling the world Australia is a global leader on environment issues, all while asking for delays and exemptions to the EU's flagship deforestation regulation. At the same time, they are undertaking a tumultuous environment reform process to, at least in part, tackle a serious and admitted deforestation problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, we now know that the laws around deforestation aren't going to come before this parliament, and I reckon we'll be bloody lucky if they come before the next parliament, having been in this place for nearly 13 years and having seen how little attention, focus and priority is put on climate action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, let's call this out for what it is. This is an attempt, on behalf of a vested interest—the beef industry—who want to have a low carbon footprint. The MLA and others have actually been ahead of the government in their emissions reduction targets, and consumers want to buy zero-carbon beef, as they do in the EU. And good on the EU for having strict regulations. I hope they stick to it. I hope they force Australia to step up and do something about avoiding deforestation and tackling this issue. Maybe then we'll be the world leaders we claim to be in environmental and climate— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BROCKMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  It's not surprising the Greens stand up in here supporting the taking over of Australian sovereignty by ideological fellow travellers from overseas. The fact is that Australia should set the rules for Australian farmers as to how they operate in what is considered forest country in Australia. We should not have those rules imposed on us from outside by another party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I consider myself a strong free-trader. It's one of the reasons I thought very hard before speaking out against a prospective free trade deal with the EU, because, quite frankly, the EU have history in this space. They have a strong focus on trying to control the countries they do business with and how they operate and, quite frankly, this is not acceptable. This is not an acceptable way for an international player to operate, and it's not an acceptable way for an Australian government to take those approaches lightly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should push back; we need to push back. We need to defend the rights of this place, this parliament, to make decisions for Australia. We need to support great industries, like the Australian beef industry, who do a lot in this area to manage the plains type environments, open savanna type environments that Senator Canavan talked about, where there is a mixture of agricultural activity, trees, landscapes. We have great Australian businesses operating in that sort of an environment. We don't need rules and regulations being imposed on Australian beef producers in this way by a foreign actor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't the only space where the European Union in particular has sought to interfere in other countries. We've seen it in the use of some chemicals. A chemical like glyphosate is extraordinarily important to the broadacre farming sector in Western Australia particularly, but also right across Australia. Without chemicals like glyphosate, broadacre farming would be forced to either shut down or return to the old methods of tilling. The environmental damage that would be done if we were forced to abandon no-till approaches to agriculture would be simply extraordinary, to the point where it would probably be either completely inefficient or extraordinarily destructive to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea that we would accept the judgement of other countries who do have other imperatives driving this—as Senator Canavan said, the type and nature of forest cover in Europe, given their long, long history of intensive agricultural production, is very different to Australia, as are their soil types and the kinds of agriculture they undertake. They're much heavier soils than in Australia and the use of chemicals such as glyphosate are less important to their farming systems, on a relative basis, than they are in Australia. So we have to be very careful when considering our relationships with other countries and other foreign organisations like the European Union.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking at the incentives that are driving their decisions, they aren't always just about positive environmental messages. Often there are underlying reasons for the settings they seek to put in place, the settings they seek to impose on other countries. These settings actually give them a relative economic advantage. That's their job, and I don't think we should find anything particularly surprising in that. But when making decisions in this country, we have to make them in the best interests of this country. That is why I'm very happy to support Senator Canavan in this urgency motion.</span>

Like many in this place, I am very passionate about advocating for Australian agriculture. I celebrate the jobs that it creates, the communities that it supports around the country, particularly in regional parts of Australia, and the significant contribution that it makes to our economy nationally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the outset, I would like to particularly acknowledge the role of the beef industry in our ag sector. It's my view and the view of many, thankfully, that our country's reputation as a high-quality, safe and sustainable producer of beef is something that all Australians should be very proud of. In fact, we're also clean and well respected around the world, having some of the best agricultural products. We are renowned for what our farmers do to make sure that we can deliver not just for us to consume here but for us to export internationally. That is why we are a global leader. It's for very, very good reasons, as any person who enjoys a steak or sausage on their barbeque would understand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to Meat &amp; Livestock Australia, the total value of Australian beef and veal exports amounts to almost $11 billion, with the export trade accounting for approximately 70 per cent of beef production in Australia. In fact, we are one of the largest beef exporting countries in the world, with only Brazil outpacing us for T-bones shipped. You don't get to be that big without a commitment to reaching and maintaining high standards of quality and safety. You also don't get to stay that big without an equally strong commitment to sustainability and sound land management practices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am the co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Red Meat with my friend Senator McDonald. I know we constantly enjoy hosting these events here at Parliament House to promote the benefits of our cattle producers, red meat and butchers and the fine work that the many men and women in the industry do every single day to feed Australians right across the country. We also educate our parliamentary colleagues, particularly those on the crossbench who failed to understand the benefits that people in this industry actually deliver for many regional communities and communities in metropolitan parts of Melbourne. These jobs are part of the whole supply chain. That always gets ignored and neglected by those on the crossbenches.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is important also to make the point that we who constantly go out to regional parts of Australia see firsthand the commitment of these Australians who do the work every single day, as I and many others in this place have seen. It is with pride that I must say that the demand for Australian beef is at a record high. Indicators are that, in the future, it will only continue to grow. This is very, very good news for the thousands of jobs that it supports across regional and rural parts of Australia. In 2021-22, for example, over 430,000 people were employed in Australia's meat and livestock industry. From the direct jobs of our many producers, who wake up at the crack of dawn, to the additional industries like transport, veterinary services and meat processing, the jobs it provides are critical.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The commitment of the industry and the government to sustainability and constant improvement in livestock practices will play an important role in ensuring that we keep our status as a leader in beef production. But I'm concerned at what the implementation of the European Union Deforestation Regulation would mean for our beef producers. I'm concerned about the complexity of the measures and the regulatory burden that it would create, and I know beef producers share this concern, as does the government. Like all governments should be, ours is committed to combating deforestation and reversing net forest loss. Like the EU, we appreciate the importance of our forests and sustainable agricultural practices. This was mentioned by the former minister Murray Watt when he spoke at beef week in Rockhampton, where he articulated the government's call on the EU to delay the implementation of the regulation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:04</span>):  Last year the European Union regulation on deforestation-free products entered into force. It seeks to control deforestation worldwide using a devious trick: requiring proof that products imported into the EU did not originate from recently deforested land or contribute to forest degradation—products like Australian cattle and wood, as well as derived products like leather, chocolate and furniture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It does seem inconsistent to One Nation that the two parties, Liberal-National and Labor, who just voted through a bill to prevent illegally logged timber coming into Australia, now oppose a measure to stop the same material being exported from Australia to the EU. One Nation, on the other hand, opposes both measures. Trying to control deforestation through holding food and building materials hostage is the long way around the block. It introduces compliance costs, and it's impossible to confidently determine the status of products. It's easier to use satellite imaging to identify and take direct action against illegal logging.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Using the European Union approach allows for politics to enter into the equation. It allows greenmail, it allows tit-for-tat sanctions on spurious environmental grounds and it gives life to bureaucracies that should not exist. For instance, define 'recently cleared land'. In Australia, farmers will let fields go fallow for several years, after which there is some vegetation growth, which is cleared to return the field to use. It's bad enough that farmers have to put up with idiot greenies crying over junk vegetation being mulched to enrich the soil. Now we must put up with the European Union bureaucrats joining them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seriously, our farmers won't be able to feed and clothe the world with the layers of stupid regulation being heaped on them. They're the best farmers in the world. They know what they're doing. I don't know how we can influence the European Union on this matter, yet One Nation is happy to support the motion. At some point, hunger might inspire an awakening of commonsense across Europe and across the Liberals, Nationals and Labor to stop pushing climate fraud and its allies and to stop pushing net zero.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="123072" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:07</span>):  I also rise to support this urgency matter, and I thank Senator Canavan and Senator Ciccone for providing a bipartisan position of reason on this matter. To be clear, this is not about environmental management or protection. This is not about diversity. This is not about habitat protection. This is nothing more than a cheap, non-tariff barrier to trade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this will do is ensure that Australian beef producers and, I'm concerned, other agricultural producers, like blueberry and cane farmers, will also bear the brunt of these EU deforestation regulations. We don't have a huge beef market into the EU—it is a very premium market—but what we do have are markets for things like cattle hides, markets that could otherwise no longer exist because of the crazy rhetoric on pleather and other fake leather products, on motor vehicles and on other things. But I digress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I am concerned about is that we are going to have a non-elected, non-Australian organisation restricting Australian farmers from being able to export into this market and, worse, that these restrictions will be picked up by other countries. When we start seeing these same standards which are unclear and undefined creeping into other regions and other trade markets, this is incredibly dangerous. We know that, over the last five years, since 2019, we have seen 10,000 pages of legislation on this matter. That equates to about 15 pages a day that farmers are expected to manage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is outrageous because food production, fibre production, is the most important thing that we can do for humans. We eat three times a day, and the quality of food that we produce should be protected. Our farming expertise should be protected and encouraged. As I've already said, this is a non-tariff barrier to trade and is going to restrict Australian farmers. Worse, we're not sure where it stops. This is an incredibly important precedent that has to be pulled up. I think that the lack of definition, of Q&amp;As provided and of advice means that we are trying to manage a regulation that is unclear and complex, and it is an unreasonable regulatory burden to put on people who are doing such important work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm from northern Australia. I also want to flag what this will mean to the development of northern Australia. From Cape York right across the Northern Territory, this will stop any future development of agriculture and, potentially, mining. This is a shocking piece of regulation that we should hold out against at every opportunity. Already we're seeing companies like Woolworths and banks adopt some of these allegedly science based target initiatives, but I'm here to tell you that they are not about environmental management. They are a restriction that we should be very afraid of. I want to call out to Woolworths and any other retailers here in Australia: if you think adopting these measures is going to be in the interests of Australian farmers or Australian consumers, you are wrong. You will restrict their ability to farm, and, worse, the contagion may mean that we will see other regions and other trade areas for Australia also restricted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is dangerous stuff. Wars are fought over food production. Food security, food reliability and, particularly, the high standards of Australian produce are things that we should nurture, encourage and protect. To have these EU deforestation regulations that are not about the environment but about non-tariff barriers to trade is dangerous. We should be very afraid of what this could do to both our beef industry and farmers more broadly, and I urge the government to hold out against it and ensure that our farmers are protected at all costs. </span>

The Government considers the PJCD would have been an important forum for ensuring Parliament is appropriately briefed on the activities of the Regulator with necessary security safeguards in place. It is therefore regrettable that, despite the bi-partisan recommendation of this Committee, Coalition Senators voted with Greens Senators to negative the PJCD Bill in the Senate on 4 July 2024. Should the Government decide to reintroduce the PJCD Bill, the Government will take this recommendation into account.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The CGRPs include new mandatory requirements for strengthened briefing by officials and decision making, recording and reporting by ministers (paragraphs 4.6 and 4.7). In addition to the existing requirements under the CGRGs, officials will be required to provide ministers with clear advice on the merits of grant applications and to indicate which applications can be supported within the available funding. In addition, officials must recommend that applications that do not meet any of the selection criteria be rejected. Officials are also encouraged to make other specific recommendations regarding the grant applications. These recommendations could, for example, be based on other factors outlined in the grant opportunity guidelines (paragraph 4.7(d)). The new key principles of 'Consistency with grant guidelines and established processes' makes clear that grant opportunity guidelines should clearly set out how such factors will be assessed and applied ( paragraph 13.3). </span>

Ministers must also record in writing any conflicts of interest relating to a grant that they approve (paragraph 4.10). </span>

The decisions by ministers under paragraphs 4.11 and 4.12 must also be recorded on GrantConnect. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:14</span>):  I rise to speak on the government response to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee report on the Australian Naval Nuclear Power Safety Bill 2023. We asked for the usual courtesy of an early provision of the government's response to assist us. We weren't afforded that courtesy; it's Defence, so there's a love of secrecy. It is a bit odd in this case because it's now been made public by being tabled, but we asked for the usual courtesy and we weren't granted the usual courtesy. I think that speaks to the ongoing frustration many people have with the way Defence treats parliament and democratic oversight. It's part of a pattern of aggressive nondisclosure that comes from Defence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill was first presented in 2023. It proposes to set up a standalone naval nuclear regulator. The government thought they could just wave it through because the impetus of AUKUS would somehow drive the parliament to wave this through without close scrutiny. The difficulty the government had was that the bill deals with an incredibly controversial matter of public interest—putting in place a regulatory regime to deal with nuclear powered submarines—and brings into that the growing public disquiet and opposition to the AUKUS project. Last time I checked, the AUKUS project was not much more popular than the Labor Party; I think it had about 33 per cent public support, and it was falling. There were those matters of genuine public interest with the subject matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the bill was actually read by my office and subject matter experts, it became clear that it was a dangerous and reckless proposal from the Albanese government in a number of ways. The first way in which it is dangerous and reckless is that it's proposing a standalone regulator for naval nuclear propulsion, and it proposes that that regulator report to the defence minister and be oversighted by the defence minister. The defence minister is at least notionally the person in charge of the Australian Defence Force. Where you have both the operator and the regulator of a nuclear facility or facilities responsible to the same minister, you have a shameful lack of independence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the non-negotiable minimum standards under the International Atomic Energy Agency for nuclear regulation—and that's whether it's civilian or military—and one of the non-negotiable key safety features the International Atomic Energy Agency requires for a nuclear regulator is legal, structural and practical independence from the operator. The United States, for its nuclear submarine project, addresses that by having both the Department of Energy and the Department of the Navy as co-regulators of its naval nuclear propulsion. The UK has a blended form of regulation, with both civilian and military regulators forming a combined regulator of the UK naval nuclear propulsion ecosystem. Australia decided to reject both of those and come up with its own model, which literally has the regulator solely reporting to the defence minister and indeed giving the defence minister the power to direct the regulator as well—a critical, inherent and fundamental flaw in the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second issue that became apparent on a close reading of the legislation was that it was putting in place a regulatory system that was giving the defence minister, through regulation, the power to nominate anywhere in the country—whether public land or private land, defence land or not defence land—to be a high-level nuclear waste dump. This is in circumstances where Australia has failed to get a low-level nuclear waste facility approved, because of the intense opposition from First Nations traditional owners and local communities. The government attempts to avoid all of that by creating an absolute power, in the defence minister, to nominate anywhere in the country, at any point and without any process, to be a high-level nuclear waste dump. This dump would take the most toxic nuclear waste on the planet, which is highly radioactive material, including the reactor components and spent nuclear fuel from highly enriched uranium that is in UK and US nuclear submarines and potentially Australian nuclear submarines. The community couldn't believe that the government was proposing to give that absolutely unrestrained power to the defence minister. They were appalled by the proposal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third aspect which really set an irradiated cat amongst the pigeons was the decision by whoever the genius drafters of the bill were—someone in Defence, no doubt—to permit the United States and the United Kingdom to dump their nuclear waste at any one of these nuclear waste facilities to be created at the stroke of a pen by the defence minister. The legislation automatically creates a nuclear waste facility just off Perth, on Garden Island, and another nuclear waste facility in Port Adelaide, 10 kays from the Adelaide CBD. It is already creating those two nuclear waste facilities. The legislation then said that it would be permissible to dump nuclear waste from an AUKUS submarine in not only those two facilities but any other facility in the country. And an AUKUS submarine is defined in the act to be a UK sub, a US sub or an Australian sub.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the UK, for example, has a couple of dozen rusting hulks of nuclear submarines chock-full of highly irradiated reactor parts and highly enriched uranium that they don't have a solution for. You can go on Google and look at them. The United States has a similar problem of rusting hulks of nuclear submarines tied up and chock-a-block with high-level nuclear waste. They're just looking for some sucker to take all their nuclear waste, and in walks the Albanese government, which puts its hand up and says, 'We'll take all your high-level nuclear waste.' Is it any wonder that the community was in revolt about this?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At every hearing we went to we heard the same thing: How could they possibly be doing this? How reckless! There's no independence in the regulator, no community consultation, and we're taking US and UK high-level nuclear waste. Who came up with this stuff? The answer, it appears, is Minister Marles and his genius advisers in the Australian Submarine Agency; that's who came up with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We now see that the government is moving to make some minor changes, and we welcome what we understand these changes to be. There'll be some form of community consultation, some form of slightly greater independence, in terms of the senior positions, in the new nuclear regulator. This wouldn't have happened without a widespread community campaign.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we first raised the issue of the high-level waste being from US and UK submarines, at the end of last year, we had the defence minister come out and say it was Greens scaremongering. He actually got a front-page headline in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> saying it was Greens scaremongering. They now realise it's a significant issue, but they'll be moving an amendment that is grossly inadequate. The legislation is still permitting high-level nuclear waste, if it's contaminated reactor parts or cooling rods, to be dumped in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be a lot more to be said on this when we read in detail the response and consider the amendments. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This monitor reports on the committee's consideration of 122 legislative instruments registered between 28 June and 22 July 2024. In this monitor, the committee has commented on three new instruments, including the Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment (Vaping Reforms) Regulations 2024. This instrument supports the vaping reforms introduced by the Therapeutic Goods and Other Legislation Amendment (Vaping Reforms) Act, which was recently passed by the parliament. The instrument amends two sets of regulations to specify commercial quantities of vaping goods for the purposes of new offences and civil penalty provisions in the act. The instrument also introduces conditions applying to existing exemptions in the regulations that allow sponsors to lawfully handle therapeutic vaping devices and goods where they were imported or manufactured before 1 March 2024.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this monitor, the committee has raised scrutiny concerns about the broad discretionary powers in the instrument. These powers also appear to be coercive in nature, as they require the production of documents and allow entry to premises. For example, a number of conditions introduced by the instrument require sponsors of vaping devices or goods to allow authorised officers to enter any premises at any reasonable time and enable such officers to make recordings on those premises. While broad discretionary, coercive powers can seriously impact on an individual's rights and liberties, the committee expects these powers will not ordinarily be included in delegated legislation. Where an instrument does include coercive powers, the committee expects that the explanatory statement will explain why this is considered necessary and appropriate. Further, where instruments confer broad discretionary powers, the committee expects the explanatory statement to set out several matters, including the factors the decision-maker will consider in exercising the discretion, who will exercise the discretion, their qualifications or skills, how the public interest is served by including the powers in the instrument and whether an independent merits review is available for decisions and actions in connection with these powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this monitor, the committee is requesting the Minister for Health and Aged Care's advice about these matters, as they are not addressed in the instrument's explanatory statement. The committee is also raising privacy concerns about several conditions introduced by the instrument. Some of these conditions require sponsors of therapeutic goods and devices to produce documents to an authorised officer and allow them to make copies, enter premises or make recordings. However, the explanatory statement does not explain the nature and scope of the information that might be collected, used or disclosed, whether it may contain personal information or whether any safeguards are in place to protect personal information. Accordingly, the committee is requesting the minister's advice on these matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has also commented on the Therapeutic Goods (Vaping Goods—Possession and Supply) Determination 2024 as amended by the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, including a number of offences and civil penalties for the importation, manufacture and commercial supply of therapeutic vaping goods. These instruments are made pursuant to that act and set out vaping goods or classes that may be supplied or possessed in Australia, the persons or classes of persons that may possess or supply the goods and the circumstances and conditions on the possession or supply. The committee is raising scrutiny concerns, as, in doing so, the instruments create exemptions to offence provisions in primary legislation. The committee's longstanding view is that provisions which create exemptions to primary legislation or include significant elements of a regulatory scheme should ordinarily be included in the primary legislation instead of delegated legislation. However, where these provisions are nonetheless included in delegated legislation, the committee expects the explanatory statement to comprehensively justify the nature and scope of the exemptions and explain why it is appropriate to include them in delegated legislation. The committee is therefore requesting the minister's advice as to why it's necessary and appropriate to include the exemptions in the instrument, as this is not detailed in the relevant explanatory statements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, the committee is concerned that these instruments also confer broad discretionary coercive powers—which enable the production, seizure and inspection of documents or information—and that many of the conditions in the instrument require the collection and disclosure of information which may contain personal information. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee looks forward to engaging with the minister on these matters and its other concerns as detailed in <span style="font-style:italic;">Delegated legislation monitor</span> 10. The committee has also resolved to lodge protective notices of motion to disallow three instruments examined in this monitor. However, the committee wishes to emphasise that these protective notices of motion are being given to facilitate the committee's consideration of the instruments, and this is prior to the minister having the opportunity to respond to the committee's comments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The timing of these protective notices of motion to disallow are a reflection of the significant number and the complexity of legislative instruments registered in June, at the end of the financial year, and the time taken by the committee and its secretary to scrutinise the high volume of instruments. The protective notices to which I've just referred will be lodged on 17 and 19 September—the last day on which these notices can be lodged—to facilitate the maximum amount of additional time to engage with the minister and resolve the committee's scrutiny concerns. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee would also like to thank the agencies and ministers that have provided updates to the committee secretariat on the progress of implementing outstanding undertakings in line with the committee's new practice. I'm pleased to advise the chamber that the number of undertakings that have been outstanding for more than 90 days has decreased to 24 matters, and that 12 undertakings have been implemented since 16 August. I reiterate the committee's expectation that undertakings are implemented in a timely manner and that the committee will continue to closely monitor the implementation of outstanding undertakings. With these comments, I commend the committee's <span style="font-style:italic;">Delegated </span><span style="font-style:italic;">legislation monitor</span> 10 of 2024 to the Senate. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The National Health Amendment {Technical Changes to Averaging Price Disclosure Threshold and Other Matters) Bill 2024 amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Health Act 1953 </span>to clarify the operation of provisions relating to pricing and supply arrangements for older and low-cost medicines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Health Act 1953, </span>price reductions can occur for multi- branded medicines listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—these are known as price disclosure price reductions. These price reductions ensure that the subsidy paid by the Commonwealth under the PBS for a particular medicine more closely reflects the price actually paid in the market for a medicine by a pharmacist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This results in price reductions to some medicines on the PBS on 1 April and 1 October of each year. These reductions are based on data submitted to the Department by medicines companies about their sales volume and revenue. A price reduction can occur where the difference between the PBS price and the average market price that the medicine is being sold at meets thresholds in section 99ADH of the Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Amendments under the Bill clarify provisions that were introduced through the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Health Amendment (Enhancing the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Act 2021 </span>that implemented reforms negotiated with the medicines industry through Strategic Agreements, to improve access to medicines for Australian patients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Amendment Act included new prov1s1ons to support supply of the medicines that Australians need and use every day. This was achieved through the 'Medicines Supply Security Guarantee' which included reforms to improve the supply of older, lower cost multi-branded medicines referred to in the Act as 'designated brands'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will make technical amendments only, which are intended for avoidance of doubt and therefore are not intended to change the operation of the provisions in the Amendment Act which have been in effect since 1 July 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill includes amendments that apply retrospectively and prospectively to ensure the understanding of the provisions is consistent with the Parliament's intention when it passed the Amendment Act, removing any possible doubt as to how these provisions have operated to date, and how they will continue to operate. The amendments clarify provisions in section 99ADH of the Act which relate to the 12.5% average unadjusted price reduction test, and section 99ADHC of the Act which relates to the timing of when a brand becomes a designated brand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments to section 99ADH of the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Health Act 1953 </span>reflect the policy intent outlined in the Explanatory Memorandum for the 2021 Act, which states in relation to designated brands with an approved ex-manufacturer price greater than $4:</span>

                    <span style="font-style:italic;">
                    </span>'...<span style="font-style:italic;">there will be no further price reductions under the Act unless, over a period of three consecutive data collection periods (1.5 years),.the brand is discounted on average by 12.5% or more without taking a price reduction, or if the brand is discounted by more than 30% in any one price disclosure cycle'</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments clarify paragraph 99ADH(6)(b), that for a brand to pass the 12.5% average unadjusted price reduction test, that a price reduction cannot have occurred as a result of calculations using data from the 3 consecutive data collection periods used in the test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Each data collection period is 6 months in duration, therefore 3 consecutive data collection periods results in a period of 1.5 years between a possible price reduction for designated brands that have discounted on average by 12.5% or more in those periods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Section 99ADHC of the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Health Act 1953 </span>sets out the conditions for a brand to be a designated brand and subject to a range of more protective pricing and supply provisions. These provisions include price disclosure thresholds, floor price protections, and the Minister's powers under Division 3CA if a medicine company offers a discount or incentive in relation to sales of a designated brand with an AEMP of $4 or less. Designated brands are also subject to the minimum stockholding requirements under Division 3CAA. As outlined in the Explanatory Memorandum for the Amendment Act in relation to designated brands:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">
                    </span>
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">'Where a PBS listed brand is protected by the price reduction floor, it will be subject to a condition that minimum stocks of the brand are held in Australia'</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As there are various consequences that flow from brand of pharmaceutical item being identified as a 'designated brand', it is necessary to clarify the timing on when a brand becomes a designated brand. The Bill provides a definition of <span style="font-style:italic;">'previous data collection period' </span>to make clear which data collection period the 'previous data collection period' refers to, which is required to determine whether or not a brand is a designated brand. This in tum ensures it is clear that each of the operative provisions associated with a designated brand are effective from the same date on which a brand becomes a designated brand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill includes prov1s10ns that are retrospective, commencing from 1 July 2022, in the interests of providing certainty to the various medicine supply chain stakeholders due to the inherent complexity associated with the PBS statutory framework. Although the amendments do not change the intended meaning of the provisions, they are made for the avoidance of doubt to avoid potential ambiguity. Therefore, retrospectivity and validation removes any potential doubts regarding past price reductions subsequent to which subsidies have already been paid to approved suppliers by reference to reduced approved ex-manufacturer prices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In conclusion, this Bill includes technical amendments only, that will provide clarity regarding the operation of sections 99ADH and 99ADHC of the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Health Act 1953 </span>that relate to designated brands. These amendments are consistent with the Parliament's intention when it passed the Amendment Act and the overarching policy intent of the price disclosure regime.</span>

This addresses practical difficulties and disadvantages to parties seeking to make an appeal over the holiday period—when many legal assistance providers and law firms have limited staff and capacity to assist.

There is currently inconsistency as to when this 28-day period begins and ends across these different Acts. This Bill harmonises timeframes to apply to the Tribunal for review of these decisions by applying the standard timeframes in the ART Act and related rules to these decisions (which cannot be less than 28 days after the decision is deemed to have been made). The amendments ensure consistency for users and reduce unnecessary administrative burden for the Tribunal. </span>

The Government considers that all forms of family violence are unacceptable and is committed to addressing the economic consequences of family violence on separated families. Family violence is a critical and far-reaching issue in the community. Women are victims of family violence from a current of former partner at significantly higher rates than men. First Nations women, in particular, are disproportionately impacted by family violence. They are 33 times more likely to be hospitalised due to violence than non-Indigenous women and six times more likely to die as a result of family violence. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Women are also more likely to experience financial difficulties after separation and face a higher risk of poverty than men. This is particularly the case where there is family violence involved, with research indicating that victims of family violence struggle to achieve a fair division of property under the Family Law Act, and may suffer long-term financial disadvantage. For any children involved, in addition to the trauma of exposure to family violence, they may also then face financial insecurity and housing instability as a result of an inequitable outcome for their primary carer in a property settlement.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Family Law Act does not currently identify family violence as a relevant matter for the court to consider in a property settlement. This has been left to common law principles in case law, which are difficult to find, understand and keep up with. There has been a high evidentiary threshold for establishing the relevance and impact of the violence, and limited evidence that the principles result in a meaningful adjustment to the distribution of property in a victim-survivor's favour. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill makes amendments to explicitly allow the court to consider the effect of family violence on the parties' ability to contribute to the property pool of a relationship, and to consider the effect of family violence on their future needs. This may be considered by the court along with a range of other factors to inform its decision about dividing property and finances. The effect of family violence can also be considered by the court in determining an application for spousal maintenance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill sends a strong message to the community that property settlement outcomes should recognise the effect of family violence on individuals, and on the wealth and welfare of the family, where this is relevant. It makes clear to the family law courts, and parties negotiating outside of court, that the economic consequences of family violence are relevant to resolving property and financial aspects of relationship breakdown. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will introduce a duty of disclosure for property and financial matters into the Family Law Act. While the duty currently exists in Court Rules, the ALRC recommended that the duty to disclose be elevated from the Rules and codified in the Family Law Act, to support the transparent disclosure of separating couples' financial circumstances. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will make the less adversarial trial approach available in property and other non-child-related proceedings. The less adversarial trial enables the court to actively manage the conduct of the proceedings, including directing how and on what issues evidence is brought forward and dealt with. Extending this beyond child-focussed proceedings will support parties to raise family violence risks in property and other proceedings, ensuring they are safe and these issues are managed effectively throughout the proceedings. It will also support those seeking to raise the economic effect of family violence as a factor relevant to determining their property or spousal maintenance matter to bring forward evidence of family violence and its effects. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Pets hold an important and unique place in many Australian families. In fact, in 2022, 69% of Australian households had amounting to 28.7 million animals across 6.9 million households. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Families have strong emotional attachments to their pets yet pets are treated like any other type of property under the Family Law Act. This can be a source of confusion and angst for separating Australian families, particularly in circumstances where there is family violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill proposes amendments that will apply particular considerations to pets—defined as 'companion animals'—in determining the ownership of the pet as part of a property settlement. This will allow a court to make orders giving ownership of a pet to one party following a relationship breakdown. In making such an order, the court will be able to consider factors such as any history of family violence during the relationship, the extent to which each party has cared for the animal, any history of cruelty to the pet by a party, and the relationships of a party or a child with the pet. This will help recognise pets as a unique type of property that deserves special considerations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will provide the courts with the ability to prevent records and other evidence generated from a child or party's engagement with health and specialist domestic and family violence services from being viewed by the other party or used as evidence, where the harm in doing so outweighs the need for the evidence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While these records will often contain information relevant to proceedings, the experience of having private medical records or counselling notes made available to the other party is traumatic and distressing for many litigants. Seeking to have sensitive information disclosed and adduced in family law proceedings is also a method that can be employed by perpetrators to exploit legal systems to continue to their abuse an ex-partner. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to rise to speak to this motion today because tax reform is desperately needed in this country. Yesterday I addressed the issue of bureaucratic inefficiency, but we also need to change the way in which our taxation system works because we currently have a system that punishes those people who are productive and rewards those who sit back on their wealth. It can be lazy wealth, and it's not earning an income.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have a system in this country where, for some reason, we seem to want to tax domestic earnings much higher than offshore earnings. That, of course, encourages retained earnings to be sent offshore, only to be replaced by foreign debt, and, yet again, there is even a special provision in the tax act that allows the interest you pay on this foreign debt to actually be exempt from tax. I became aware of that section of the tax act, and I've mentioned it many times before. It's section 128F of the 1936 act: the publicly offered test. It was the moment I thought, 'I'm going to have to make a run for politics here because there is no-one else in this country who will actually be aware of what this act is, why it's there and the impact it has on this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will start off on that slightly obscure but very important section because that publicly offered test is not a publicly offered test at all. What it says is that if you offer a bond in the primary market to at least 10 participants you don't have to pay withholding tax and, of course, anyone that knows anything about the Treasury bond market knows that not anyone in the public can just walk up and issue a bond in the Treasury bond market. I think it was half a million in my time; it might be a million today. That's the minimum parcel you need to issue a bond in the bond market. The sort of people that pay withholding tax, of course, are foreigners. I knew straightaway from my Treasury experience that this was a section in the tax act that allowed foreign banks to avoid having to pay tax on the interest that we pay them offshore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought to myself, 'I wonder how people who earn interest income in this country would feel knowing that foreign banks don't have to pay tax on the interest that we pay to them.' Many hardworking Australians, pensioners in particular, and retirees who earn interest on their bank account do want to earn interest on their bank account as they don't necessarily want to have their money in the stock market as they get older. They don't want to suddenly wake up one morning to find out the Dow Jones has collapsed and the value of their equities has rapidly diminished. Many older people don't want to take risks and do like to invest in fixed interest. Well, guess what? You've got to pay tax, but foreign banks don't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to address many other issues in this area. I know I'm going to run out of time, but it's important that I do address it. One of the other things that really grinds my gears in this country is the fact that people on low income who earn less than the cost of living have to pay income tax on that cost of living. I have to pay income tax on my income. All that does is actually drive these people further into poverty. My view is that if you get out of bed every day and put your nose to the grindstone—I don't care whether you're earning 40 grand or a 100 grand—that first 40 to 50 grand on your income should be tax-free. Currently, if you earn, say, $50,000, you're paying about $10,000 tax, you're paying about $6,000 in superannuation and you're just about to start paying HECS. You are effectively losing $16,000. So you are going from earning $50,000 to having take-home pay of $34,000. It's highly likely that unless you're still living at home with your parents—even then you would probably struggle to live on $34,000—you are going to go back below the poverty line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that we tax low earners at too high a rate in this country, and it needs to be reduced. Ideally, it needs to be reduced to zero. I think we also need to call out Treasury for the way that they model these tax cuts, because they effectively don't assume secondary impacts. That discriminates against income tax for low-income earners, because, if you are a low-income earner and you did get a tax cut of $1,000, it's highly likely that most of that money will end up back in the Treasury within the next 12 months. We need to look at why we tax low-income earners at 16c in the dollar. It was previously 19c in the dollar. We need to ask ourselves why those low-income earners are playing 16c on the dollar plus two per cent Medicare plus 12 per cent super while you can have money in superannuation uncapped. You can have millions of dollars in superannuation. You could be earning $150,000 in superannuation, and the most you're paying on your earnings is 15c. I fail to see why someone earning less than $45,000 has pay 18c including Medicare plus 12 per cent super, while someone who's a multimillionaire and has millions of dollars in super only pays 15c on their earnings. If it's a capital gain and they have held it for longer than a year they only pay 10c.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet again we have arbitrage between different trust structures or different corporate structures. If you've got your money in a superannuation fund, which is effectively a trust, you're paying a lower rate of tax than someone who is trying to get ahead by getting out of bed and trying to earn that through an active wage. Many of low-income earners work very, very hard. They travel the furthest to work. They're doing the menial jobs like cleaning, cooking or working in aged care. These aren't easy jobs, and someone has to do them. We really need to look at the way we go about taxing low-income earners. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's another thing that we need to look at. There is a big hoo-ha at the moment over the fact that Treasury want to bring in a system whereby, if you have more than $3 million in assets in superannuation, you would pay 30c in the dollar, while if you have less than $3 million in assets, you would pay 15c in the dollar. It's really strange that with superannuation for some reason tax is based on your balance and not on your income. You could have $2.8 million in superannuation and earn a five per cent return, so you could earn $140,000. Or you could have $3,000,001 in super and earn three per cent, or $90,000, and pay a higher rate of tax on $90,000, because that particular year your rate of return on your asset was less than someone else's rate of return on their asset. So you would pay a higher tax rate than someone who actually earned more than you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I often think it's being used to mask the significant superannuation tax concessions, which are just shy of $50 billion. If you look at the tax expenditure statement, that $50 billion goes mainly to the upper 25 per cent. Nearly all of it goes to the upper 25 per cent, while we still have the pension, and it costs $54 billion. That tax expenditure statement has actually forecast that tax concessions for superannuation, which mainly go to the upper 25 per cent, are going to very quickly exceed the cost of the pension itself. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is another issue that we need to have a look at, because it is completely dysfunctional. There is no symmetry in any of this whereby we have a flatter tax rate. Different people, depending on their income, can have the same income and pay different amounts of tax, and that's completely dysfunctional. What we want is a system where we have a very simple tax system and everybody pays the same rate of tax based on the level of income they earn, regardless of whether it's in superannuation or not. It should be taxed at a flat rate on the same amount of money. I think that we need to seriously look at taxing superannuation based on income levels, and I would suggest that your first $20,000 to $30,000 in superannuation is tax-free. You can add that on top of your first $40,000 outside of superannuation, and there you go. You've still got a very generous tax-free income if you're retired, but after that you go back to your marginal rate, rather than just have a flat 15 per cent in superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing we need to look at in this country is that we have an onshore tax rate of 30c, and that's before franking credits, which I'll come to in a minute. Depending on the withholding tax treaty that you're dealing with and depending on where that money is sent, that withholding tax rate on profits transferred offshore can be between zero and 15c in the dollar if it's with one of our recognised trading partners. That is basically encouraging any company to either set up a subsidiary offshore or transfer their profits offshore. That is ridiculous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw it a few years ago with the iron ore companies. Obviously, if they kept their earnings here in Australia, they'd pay 30c, so they decided to set up a marketing hub in Singapore whereby they could pay marketing fees to Singapore. What Singapore knows about marketing iron ore is beyond me—it's not like they've ever had any iron ore—but suddenly BHP, Rio and Fortescue decided that they needed to set up a marketing hub in Singapore. Of course, that was nothing more than a tax dodge. I'm glad to say that the tax office did get onto those iron ore companies about it and they've shut them down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this sort of behaviour goes on all the time. We've seen it with Pfizer, for example. Their operating profit ratio is seven per cent, despite the fact that their worldwide operating profit is 40 per cent. Of their $1.4 billion in sales, about $1 billion of it got transferred to Ireland. Why Ireland? Why that money needed to go to Pfizer Ireland, who I doubt would actually have a manufacturing plant, is beyond me—other than the fact that Ireland has a company tax rate of 12 per cent. So it's very simple logic. If you get a tax deduction here, you save 30c in the dollar. If you send the money to a low-income tax jurisdiction, you pay 12c there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people will say, 'You can't have withholding tax on profits sent offshore because you'll have double taxation.' That's not the way it works. What you've actually got to look at is the cumulative rate of taxation. If there's a withholding tax rate of 10c here in Australia, on profit-centre Ireland, which has a company tax rate of 12c, the cumulative rate of taxation is 10c plus 12c, which is 22c. It's less than 30c. So there's an eight-cent arbitrage there—for the sake of paying a lawyer to set up a subsidiary, putting an office over there and effectively transferring profits offshore. That sort of behaviour goes on quite a lot. While I know the tax office does a very good job and tries very hard to crack down on it, they literally cannot keep up with the number of international transactions going on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why the very easy way to do all this and deal with this in a heartbeat is to effectively increase the rate of withholding tax on all profits sent offshore. There are more tax treaties than you can poke a stick at, unfortunately. I haven't been able go through all of them, even though after I finished my masters of tax law I actually went back and did another subject at the University of Sydney just to come up to speed with it. But you just can't keep up with this sort of stuff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Put in place a higher withholding tax rate offshore and lower the company tax here so that we encourage people and companies to retain their earnings here in Australia rather than shift the profits offshore. You will find that, like anyone that understands a balance sheet, if you increase your retained earnings, you'll have a higher capital account and you'll need less debt. So it's actually one of these things that will help reduce foreign debt in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing we need to look at is the amount of churn and the real company tax rate here in Australia. Imputation tax credits have had two iterations in this country. The first time was when Paul Keating introduced imputation tax credits, and the second time was when Peter Costello decided that he would refund tax credits. Of course, what that did was create a massive churn in the economy. I've worked on both sides of the ledger here, first of all as a company tax accountant, where you would pay company tax down to the ATO in Canberra and then, six months later, the shareholders would lodge their tax return and the ATO would refund the company tax paid to Canberra back to the shareholder.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia, I think, is the only country—or one of two or three countries in the world—that refunds franking credits. It's a very inefficient system of churning money through Canberra. It requires companies to keep franking accounts and streaming accounts, and they've got to watch how they frank their dividends and everything like that. Then it creates a whole heap of work on the other side for the public accountants, who have to go through and work out all the franking credits and all the rules around that. You're much better off having—and I'm pretty sure the states do this—a rebate of 10c. That way, you don't actually have to repay the money once it's been sent to Canberra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to have a look at that, because our net company tax rate is now below 15c as a result of the balance in superannuation funds going from about $500 million, when Costello introduced the refund of franking credits, to now $3½ trillion, and it's forecast to hit $9 trillion by 2050 or 2060. So, we're just churning money through these superannuation funds, only to repay it later on. Let's get rid of this, yet again, arbitrage between these different legal structures in which taxable income is declared. But, long story short: if we want to increase productivity in this country, we need to look at lowering taxes on active income, we need to look at lowering taxes on income earned here in Australia and we need to look at actually retaining our earnings and encouraging productivity, which our current tax act does not do.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  In my first speech, in 2016, and many times since, I've called for comprehensive tax reform. The tax system in Australia as it exists is our country's most destructive system, and not just exorbitant tax rates. I'll give you some figures from the late 1990s and early 2000s. Someone on the average income paid 68 per cent of their income to government in the form of rates levies, fees, charges, special charges and special levies. That means someone's working from Monday to mid-morning Thursday to pay the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then, it's got much more complex and more absurd, and some of the data I'll give you is more recent. Some of the figures are indicative, not definitive. The ABS average income figure is $100,000. The median income figure is $67,000. Life is tough for people on the median. In 2015 Joe Hockey said that a typical person in Australia pays 50 per cent in tax—works from January to June to pay the government, and then gets to keep from July to December. Basically, as I said, people are working at least half the year—probably 68 per cent of the year—for government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we think about the tax. Tax on a house, according to a News Corporation article a few years ago and according to recent figures, is 45 to 50 per cent of the house price, The effective tax rate is 80 to 100 per cent. International accountant and auditor Derek Smith in Queensland says that 50 per cent of the price of bread is tax, which is an effective tax rate of 100 per cent. Petrol excise and tax varies. At 70 per cent, the effective tax rate is 230 per cent. So, a worker on the average income on payday gives 21 per cent of his or her gross income to the government. With what's left—that's 79 per cent—she the next day wakes up in her house and pays 80 to 100 per cent to have that house and makes some sandwiches because food is too expensive to purchase wherever she works. So, that's a tax of 100 per cent. Then she fills up at the petrol station on her way to work, and that costs her 230 per cent tax.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have GST. GST can be levied on bills, including stamp duty, so we've got a tax on a tax. So, there are three aspects. First, there's the total tax paid. Second, how is it levied? And third, is it enforced fairly? Ultimately, the people pay a tax in the form of higher prices. So, it doesn't matter if a company is being taxed or if another entity is being taxed; they pass it on to the customers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of living, inflation, overregulation and many other factors make sure that today's system of government impositions—government cost recovery—are highly regressive. Look at the carbon dioxide tax and offsets—a UN tax, driven by the UN, introduced by the Liberal-National government in 2015 under Greg Hunt and Malcolm Turnbull and now ramped up under this government with Chris Bowen and Anthony Albanese. What we've got is a highly regressive imposition of taxation and other charges by the government. The Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that the median income is $67,000. People on that median income are doing it extremely tough because of government and the mishmash that's evolved in the taxation system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That takes care of terms of reference (a) and (b) in Senator Rennick's motion. I agree with them; in fact, I agree with his whole motion, and I thank him for his motion. I've raised the need for comprehensive tax reform many times, so I support this motion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we see the core, one of the bedrocks of our federal system and Constitution—competitive federalism. That is being converted under the current tax system to competitive welfarism, destroying productivity in this country. The way competitive federalism should work is by promoting competition between the states—not cut-throat competition, just competition for efficiency. As I said yesterday, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, as Premier of Queensland, abolished death duties in Queensland and people moved to Queensland to retire, which developed the Gold Coast. The other states then saw their people were leaving, so they abolished death duties too. Now we've got Labor—and the Greens, I think—wanting to put in place a central death duty as a state duty—centrally imposed, with no competition and no accountability. When you have a marketplace in governance because the state can't operate according to their needs and the needs best suited to their constituents, then you have competitive federalism, a marketplace in governance, and that is priceless. One of the reasons we've got such low accountability in state and federal parliament is that it's too easy for the states to blame the feds and the feds to blame the states, as I said yesterday. The GST undoes competitive federalism and replaces it with competitive welfarism. It's a reward for states like Tasmania and South Australia to be inefficient and not use their resources and, instead, bludge off Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned yesterday that systems drive behaviour and behaviour shapes attitude, and the combination of behaviour and attitudes along with values and leadership and symbols determines the culture, which is the most important determinant of productivity, security and accountability. Energy prices, as I said, are a huge regressive tax on the poor. Massive record immigration is a huge regressive tax on housing, especially on the poor. As I list some of these examples, as Senator Rennick listed some of his examples, I urge you to think about the impact on our culture in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tax system is Australia's most destructive system. What behaviours does it drive? We've got the best and brightest accountants and lawyers in this country fighting the government, not helping our producers to fight our competitors overseas—the Koreans, the Japanese, the Chinese and the Americans. We've now got a tax system that's grown up like Topsy; it's a mishmash of dishonest promises to various vested interests for favours. What behaviours does that drive? Is that productive? It's certainly not productive. Inefficient or suboptimal allocation of capital and resources leads to inefficient or suboptimal decisions and a waste of resources and inefficient allocation to minimise tax rather than to maximise wealth and value.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have the ATO in a position where it can level complaints against people and businesses—small businesses particularly, because they don't have the lawyers to back them up. In addition to prosecuting those cases, they adjudicate on those cases. How can that be justice? It's not justice. It leads to corruption, and we saw that in the Australian Taxation Office just a few years ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the complexity of various structures that Senator Rennick mentioned; he's got far more experience in that than I have. They're unfair to people who can't set up structures. Senator Rennick discussed some of the modern structures in the technologies that have come up. That increases the appeal of workarounds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we've got something that Senator Hanson has talked about for many years, since 1996: multinationals basically pay no or little company tax. They use our resources for free. We've got the world's biggest freeloader, the biggest tax avoider in the world, Chevron, taking our gas and sending it overseas, using our infrastructure, our security forces and our education system and not paying much at all for the gas. This is a figure I got from Jim Killaly, the former Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, Large Business and International, who retired in 2015 or 2016. I've met him. He said in both the nineties and in 2010—and it's quoted in the newspapers—that 90 per cent of Australia's large businesses are foreign-owned and since 1953 have paid little or no company tax. Who's paying that share of tax? It's the men and women of Australia, working families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 1953, when we had double taxation legislation enacted by the Menzies Liberal government, we've had foreign companies paying little or no company tax. In the 1980s, we had Labor, with the petroleum resource rent tax, making sure that large companies such as Chevron pay little or no tax when exporting our gas from the North West Shelf. Then we had transfer pricing rorts and so many other rorts, which Senator Rennick went into. So terms of reference (c) and (d) are definitely worth keeping.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tax reform, while it's necessary and arguably one of the most important things in this country, is difficult because the uniparty, Liberal and Labor, sees new ideas, seizes on new ideas and then basically tells lies and misrepresents to destroy our tax system. Paul Keating, as Treasurer to Bob Hawke, introduced the concept of the GST. Later, when John Hewson raised it as opposition leader, who smashed it? Paul Keating smashed it. He destroyed the GST concept even though he'd come so close to putting it over the line in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Pauline Hanson, who wasn't a senator at the time, got hold of the transaction tax, it was also sent to Costello by the originators of that taxation system and taxation proposal. Peter Costello, as Treasurer—and a good treasurer—was asked about it and he said: 'Sounds like a good system. We must have a look at it.' Then Senator Hanson introduced it to the public, and he used it to try to destroy her.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And look at my motion for stopping bracket creep—a motion on a Labor bill for stopping bracket creep. Labor stood right up there and said it supports work to remove indexing of bracket creep, but it voted against it. The LNP, the Liberals and Nationals, did something similar. They stood up—Senator Hume, I think it was—and said, 'We support removal of bracket creep, the stealth tax, the hidden tax, the deceit tax,' but they voted against the indexation of bracket creep. Barely a few weeks later, Senator Sharma, in his first speech, said that one of his goals was to get rid of bracket creep. Well, pile on, but just a few weeks earlier he had voted against removing bracket creep.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Rennick has already mentioned, the tax system has been wangled and mismanaged to protect special interest groups feeding off tax loopholes. The terms of reference (e), (f), (g) and (h) are all necessary. Tax is the cost of government. That's necessary. But it's now got to the point where tax, in this country of ours, is the cost of excess government interference and excess waste—well, all waste. It's the cost of poor governance, and it's the poor who pay regressively for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support Senator Rennick's motion as a step to exposing the harm and inefficiency of the tax system. Because of the complexities of the tax system and because of the politics around it, I think the first thing to do is to get an agreement to understand that the tax system is so destructive and so inefficient. Senator Rennick's motion is a commendable first step to exposing the inefficiencies and the unfairness in the tax system. Once there's an agreement on the inefficiencies, then we need to develop principles—not a system but principles: for example, simplicity; efficiency, so the tax system actually collects more than the cost of implementing that tax; fairness; objectivity; and the fact that it's inescapable, so we don't have multinational companies coming here, stealing our resources and assets, using our infrastructure and our people, and skipping the country without paying their fair share. So we develop principles and get agreement on them, and then, once that's done, the specific system falls out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I see Senator Rennick's motion as leading to an important first step in identifying the problems and some of the solutions and then, ultimately, we can take the next step: comprehensive tax reform, defining the ultimate system and the transition of baby steps to getting there. I support Senator Rennick's motion.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Scans within scams within scams—scams costing taxpayers untold billions of dollars every year, as wind turbines and solar panels spread across regional Australia like a malignant cancer; scams driving poverty across the nation, as Australian households struggle with record electricity bills; scams driving Australian small businesses into the ground, as they struggle with reduced revenue from the cost-of-living crisis and their own record energy costs; scams involving guaranteed taxpayer returns to union controlled industry superannuation funds for investing in uneconomic technologies, ending up in Labor and Greens election coffers; and scams that leave energy-rich Australia facing serious energy shortages when economic productivity is still in sharp decline. There is the scam built on the fantasy that Australia can stop global warming all by itself, while major carbon dioxide emitters like China rapidly increase their emissions. And, of course, there's the ultimate scam—that the world is doomed unless human beings stop emitting carbon dioxide altogether.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These scams are a direct threat to Australia's future. These scams are a direct threat to jobs, farmers, miners, industry, manufacturing and innovation, and regional communities. What is truly perverse is the threat that these scams pose to Australia's natural environment and wildlife. Climate change extremists like the Greens, Labor and the teals would have us destroy the environment in order to save it. They would have us clear huge areas of native vegetation and rainforest to plant vast forests of ugly, toxic wind turbines that would end up in landfill less than 20 years later—and, I will add, they use more energy to make and erect than they will ever produce. They would have us rape the earth with child labour to get the vital ingredients for their fire-prone car batteries. They would have us cover prime agricultural land with toxic solar panels that contaminate the soil, wind turbines that harm wildlife and thousands of miles of transmission lines.</span>

Perhaps if we planted a few of those 300-metre wind turbines around Sydney Harbour or on the banks of the Yarra or Brisbane rivers they might understand. But I doubt it, because they're all hooked on the money generated by the scam. They have net zero empathy for the Australian people, as they burn down our nation's future prosperity and growth. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the many scams in this place is the concept we call carbon offsets. This is the idea that carbon dioxide emissions can be offset by buying carbon credits, generated by carbon dioxide sinks mostly located overseas. In other words, it absolves emitters of the reduction effort by handballing it to someone else. It's absolutely critical to the net-zero-emissions fantasy, because there is no human being and no human civilisation that can exist without emitting some amount of carbon dioxide. It's absolutely critical to Labor's promises to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 43 per cent by 2030.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… no longer buy voluntary carbon offsets unless required by law, as offsets have been shown to be troubled by extensive concerns about quality, lack of additionality and an inability to deliver real reductions in emissions.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In June this year, Telstra announced it would also stop using offsets. Until then, the company was the single biggest participant in the Labor government's Climate Active carbon neutral labelling program. Even the extremist Greens think they're bogus, enabling the companies to claim they're carbon neutral when these claims are built on dodgy offsets. Even a broken clock is right twice a day, but the evidence backs them up.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, a joint media investigation found that 90 per cent of rainforest carbon offsets approved by Verra, the world's leading certifier of voluntary offsets, did not represent genuine carbon reductions. Also in 2023, a systemic review of more than 2,000 offset projects found that 88 per cent of the total credit volume across renewables, cookstoves, forestry and chemical processes did not constitute real emissions reductions. Again in 2023, the Australian National University conducted an analysis which found more than 24 million Australian carbon credit units, worth more than $760 million, had led to minimal, if any, carbon sequestration. There are dozens more such revelations, but you get the idea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite all this evidence, Labor continues to push a flawed scheme based on these bogus carbon offsets. These have to be bought by the corporations and the energy companies, with the costs always passed onto Australian consumers. Energy bills have never been higher in Australia than they are today and are a major component of Labor's cost-of-living crisis. We are paying through the nose so that Labor can pretend it's taking climate change action. We are, in fact, in a per capita recession. Labor is all talk and definitely no substance. They're all power with no responsibility. It's desperate Labor virtue-signalling in a vain attempt to stop votes leaking to the Greens.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As our energy costs soar, Australians are wondering: what happened to Labor's promise to lower their power bills? The real tragedy is that all of this pain inflicted on the Australian people is completely and utterly futile. Even if we reduced our emissions to absolutely zero overnight, the reductions would be quickly overtaken by increased emissions in other countries such as China, India and Russia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This inquiry isn't just about scrutinising Labor's policies; it's about standing up for Australian families, workers, farmers and businesses carrying the burden of this scam. It's about holding this worthless, lying government accountable over expensive illusions of taking action on climate change. It's also about trying to hold them accountable for the high immigration levels that we have coming into this country, because the emissions of every person we bring into this country are about 32,000 tonnes a year. If you are really interested in reducing the emissions in this country, why have you brought in 1½ million people, adding to our carbon emissions? Clearly, you're not terribly worried about this country and its high emissions rate. You couldn't possibly be and bring in that number of people. It just doesn't make sense to me or to a lot of other Australians. It has been a scam. The whole thing is a scam. All this money is pouring into this Australian made program, even from Australians. It all sounds good, but all it is doing is keeping your carbon emissions and climate change scam going. That's BS.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another fact was brought to me this afternoon. Polls were done a couple of years ago showing about 11 per cent of Australians and, prior to that, 16 per cent of Australians agreed with climate change. After all the cost-of-living crises that have been going on at the moment, people can't afford their mortgages. They're losing their houses and they can't pay their power bills. In this polling that they did, they had 11 per cent who agreed. Now it has gone down to four per cent. That tells you that you're losing the Australian people. They're starting to wake up to the scams that are going on and they don't like it. They don't believe this rubbish that the world is coming to an end and that, if we don't address our carbon emissions, then the whole world is going to come to an absolute grinding halt.</span>

You're destroying prosperity, you're destroying our standard of living and you're adding cost to it so that future generations are going to have a huge debt to pay off. And, at the end of the day, for what? You are so hypocritical when you talk about carbon emissions. These big companies are having to offset their carbon emissions, which is destroying industries and manufacturing, yet you actually do business with China, whose emissions are over 30 per cent. You continue to buy their solar panels and their wind turbines and everything else they're manufacturing; therefore, you're not questioning it. What a bunch of hypocrites you are!</span>

But you won't do anything. You kowtow to China because you have no interest in standing up to them. What's happened is we've become so reliant on China and on what we buy from them that we can't do anything. So you buy into Australia instead of going to the heart of it and setting up real industries here in Australia that will create jobs and will enable us to provide to ourselves what we need and want. You're do absolutely nothing.</span>

Since I was first elected to parliament 28 years ago, this is the worst government I have ever seen, based on your performance in this place, on the policies you've brought in and on the destruction to this country that is going to go beyond your time and into the future. The sooner you lot are gone, the better for all of us.</span>

Yes, you heard that correctly. It's difficult to believe. Australians may wonder what we agree on. Granted, the Greens and One Nation have come to the same conclusion for very different reasons. Nonetheless, we share the conclusion that carbon dioxide credits are a scam. They are rife with opportunities for fraud.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Clean Energy Regulator has issued 140 million carbon dioxide credits. At the current spot price of $35 each, this represents a racket potentially worth $4.9 billion. That's expected to grow by 20 million credits, or $700 million, this year alone, making it $5.6 million.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens and One Nation aren't the only ones to criticise Australian carbon credit units, or ACCUs. In 2022 Professor Andrew Macintosh, environmental law expert at the Australian National University, and his colleagues published a series of papers absolutely tearing apart the ACCU system. Keep in mind that this is a $5.5 billion market that's being fabricated in part to give the UN income, ultimately. As usual, they enlist parasites who benefit while pushing UN policy for them. For example, the major banks. Rothschild Australia, the Bank of America and Merrill Lynch had on their advisory boards in this country at the time the CSIRO chief executive, Dr Megan Clark—a conflict of interest?</span>

The government should just have been honest and called it what it really was: a whitewash, a distortion and misinformation. Actually, the Chubb review is disinformation. In the past, when Professor Chubb has been requested to provide empirical scientific data within a logical scientific point backing up claims of climate change due to human carbon dioxide, he has repeatedly failed to produce it. He has never produced it, yet he's often advocated for it. He's part of the climate fraud industry and has received a lot of money to push climate fraud. He has been heavily rewarded by both Liberal-National and Labor Party governments. The Chubb review, in this case, addressed nothing of substance and provided no evidence for its claims that problems have been fixed, yet the government held the report up as proof that everything's fine. As Professor Macintosh and his colleagues outlined in their response to the Chubb review, it spent fewer than six pages discussing the ACCU rules, which relate to a $5.5 billion market. They say the Chubb report:</span>

Carbon dioxide credits can never have integrity because they are a scam designed to transfer wealth from the pockets of everyday Australians and their families and small businesses to the bank accounts of billionaire net zero scam artists and parasitic multinationals sucking on the financial payout from climate fraud and associated financial scams.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note some of these points. I won't go into them in detail. The government that introduced the renewable energy target, a scam, and the national electricity market that is really a national electricity racket—it's not a market; it's a bureaucratic controlled entity—stole farmers' property rights across the country so that they could comply with the UN's Kyoto protocol. They put in place the first policy—not legislation—advocating for a carbon dioxide tax. It wasn't Julia Gillard. It was the Howard government that did all these things. The Howard government laid the foundation for all of this. It went around the Constitution to steal farmers' property rights around the country. Then, six years after being booted from office and after the Liberals and Nationals in the Howard government told us that it was all based on science, John Howard, in a major lecture to sceptic think tank in Londan said that on the topic of climate science, he was agnostic. He didn't have the science, and now our electricity sector has been crippled because of the renewable energy target, the national electricity market and an alphabet soup of bureaucratic agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has never been—there never is—any empirical scientific data and logical scientific points that human carbon dioxide is warming the planet. There is not any from the CSIRO—I've done freedom of information requests and held them accountable in the Senate—nor from their publications ever. There is not any from the Bureau of Meteorology. It's the same deal. There is not any from the United Nations. It's the same deal. There is also no policy basis. There is no documented effect per unit of human carbon dioxide on climate factors such as air temperature, rainfall, heat waves, drought severity and frequency or storm severity, frequency and duration—none at all. There is no basis for the policy on which the carbon dioxide credits are based. There's been no cost-benefit analysis. There's been no business case. Ross Garnaut, who produced a report for the Rudd-Gillard government, said in his report on the science that there basically was no science and he was going on the consensus. Yet he is parasitically sucking on solar and wind subsidies, driving up electricity prices and putting Australians into poverty. Remember, the money that goes to the extra costs of electricity in this country is a highly regressive tax on the poor in our country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2009 and 2020 we had two global experiments showing that human carbon dioxide has no effect on carbon dioxide levels in the air. We had a major downturn with the global financial crisis in 2008. We then had a recession in 2009. COVID arrived on our shores—it didn't really hit us; the government hit us—in 2020, and then 2020 was almost a depression because of the restrictions and lockdowns. In both years, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere continued rising unabated. Yet we've been told for decades now that by cutting back on human production of carbon dioxide we would see the levels in the atmosphere start decreasing and go down. We had a major reduction in industrial activity and a severe recession in 2009 and 2020. The production of carbon dioxide from human use of hydrocarbons, coal, oil and natural gas decreased dramatically yet nothing happened. The carbon dioxide in the atmosphere kept increasing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked the CSIRO why. They said that there is an inflection. I asked them for the details of that inflection, to characterise it statistically. They failed to do it. I asked the Bureau of Meteorology, and they said, 'Senator Roberts, it would take years for that to come through.' Here is the CSIRO saying that we've already seen it and the Bureau of Meteorology saying that we will see it eventually, but it will take a long while to come. You can't make this stuff up! What the experiments in 2009 and 2020 showed is that the production of carbon dioxide from human activity will not affect the level of carbon dioxide in the air. Once you understand Henry's law—the quantities of carbon dioxide dissolved in the ocean are 50 to 70 times more than the entire atmospheric carbon dioxide—then you start to understand why that's the case. But not content with climate science fraud, the CSIRO is perpetrating gen cost, which is energy fraud based on bogus assumptions that have been completely debunked. Aidan Morrison has done a marvellous job; others have done a marvellous job.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no basis for this scam, this fraud, but let's return to the fraud. A report in the 2010s said Europol found 95 per cent of carbon dioxide trading credits were suspicious. That's easy to believe because there's no physical basis to the measurement of reductions to carbon dioxide produced. They're all projections. They're all based on guesses. They're formulae based on estimations. They were never quantified and are still not quantified. China is producing record quantities of carbon dioxide, and so are Russia, Brazil, the United States and the European Union—Australia are a small player—yet temperatures are flat and have been flat since 1995. That's almost 30 years of flat temperatures. I urge senators to establish this inquiry so that we can get to the bottom of how taxpayer money is being fraudulently abused.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might just add: only today I met with senior representatives of Rio Tinto, one of Queensland's major employers. I'm not sure whether Senator Hanson or Senator Roberts have ever bothered to go to Boyne Smelters in Gladstone. Rio Tinto, in partnership with the Queensland government, are investing heavily in renewable and other sources of power for their plant, which employs over 1,000 blue-collar workers in Gladstone, because Rio Tinto understand that their ongoing competitiveness, the ongoing future of those jobs in Gladstone and the thousands of jobs in manufacturing outfits that supply Boyne Smelters, along with other heavy industry in Gladstone, rely on making this transition towards cheaper, cleaner power. Rio Tinto are doing this because they understand that, if they want to be able to sell their product in the future across the world, they have to move towards renewable, cheaper and cleaner power. We know that One Nation and, unfortunately, elements of the LNP in Queensland want to put their heads in the sand and pretend that this is not happening. This is what companies need to do now to make sure that we have those jobs in heavy industry into the future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms that the Labor government have introduced will progressively lower baseline on a trajectory consistent with the legislated targets, delivering more than 200 million tonnes of abatement to 2030. The use of Australian carbon credit units has always been central to the safeguard mechanism since it was legislated by the previous government in 2014. Let's not forget that, on 25 November 2015, the previous government's environment minister, Greg Hunt, boasted that the safeguard mechanism would generate approximately 200 million tonnes of emissions reduction by 2030—and that was towards the weak 2030 targets that the former government had at the time, a target that has now been abandoned by the Leader of the Opposition.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACCU scheme has already been subject to multiple reviews and has been found to be sound. In 2022, the independent Chubb review found the ACCU scheme settings were sound and set out some sensible improvements that should be made. We are getting on with it and have already acted to implement the review recommendations. The Climate Change Authority's review of the scheme, which reported last December, has also found that the scheme is 'well designed', with 'robust governance, compliance and enforcement structures'.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 30 April, the Australian National Audit Office released their performance report of the ACCU scheme. They found the scheme's administration and development of methods was effective and was being effectively enforced by the Clean Energy Regulator. The Clean Energy Regulator has increased the transparency of HIR projects and established extra review and audit processes to implement recommendation 8. In May 2023, implementing the ministerial direction, the Clean Energy Regulator expanded its compliance audit program to include independent audits for regeneration and forest cover attainment checks, known as gateway checks, of all HIR projects. In June 2023, the Clean Energy Regulator published HIR project carbon estimation areas.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has also been consulting on the Climate Active program and looking at ways to drive more effective voluntary climate action and provide consumers with greater confidence about businesses' climate credentials. The program is not related to our safeguard reforms and is not one of the key levers used by the government to meet its legislated emissions reduction targets. The Albanese government has put in place a comprehensive suite of climate and energy programs to encourage businesses and organisations to act on climate change and prioritise emissions reductions. Of course, we are doing that partly because of the environmental need to act on climate change, but we're also, as I say, doing this because we understand that so many thousands of jobs across Australia, particularly in the resources sector, heavy industry and other blue-collar occupations, rely on us making this energy transition as quickly and efficiently as possible.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there are some in the Australian parliament—including One Nation and, sadly, many in the LNP—who continue to believe that we can ignore climate change. In some cases, they just don't believe that climate change is even happening. There are many in this chamber—fortunately, not in the Labor Party, but in other parties—who think that we can ignore the reality of climate change and that the rest of the world can move ahead in making this adjustment and we don't need to worry about it. The only thing that will happen as a result of that is that thousands of blue-collar workers in places like Gladstone will lose their jobs. It's not environmental activists who are making this point; it's companies like Rio Tinto.</span>

They understand that we need to make this change, because the workers want to have a job not just next year but in 10 years, 20 years, 30 years and 50 years. The way to do that is by making sure that we accept the reality of climate change, making the investments that are necessary to keep those jobs and ensuring that they are supplied by cheaper, cleaner power.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be clear, this motion is seeking to refer to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee an inquiry with a requirement to report by 26 November this year into Australia's youth justice and incarceration system, with particular reference to the outcomes and impacts of youth incarceration in jurisdictions across Australia; the overincarceration of First Nations children; the degree of compliance and non-compliance by state, territory and federal prison and detention centres with the human rights of children and young people in detention; the Commonwealth's international obligations in regard to youth justice, including the rights of the child, freedom from torture and civil rights; the benefits and need for enforceable national minimum standards for youth justice consistent with our international obligations and any related matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen so many instances of states and territories permitting their criminal justice system to imprison, in particular, First Nations youth at rates that are shameful. But we've also seen instances of systemic abuse across the entire country. There was a royal commission recently into the Tasmanian treatment of young people, more broadly, and child sexual abuse. Its findings in relation to Tasmania's sole child detention system were so appalling, showing such systemic abuse of young people in that prison: physical abuse, sexual abuse and violence. It is unimaginable that that institution continues, and yet it does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give you one indication of the horrific nature of that child jail in Tasmania. The evidence was that, when the young girls were being admitted into that detention centre, if they had reached puberty, they were automatically being put on the pill. The system knew that they would end up being sexually assaulted in that place. That facility continues. There has been only one criminal prosecution brought in relation to the systemic abuse identified in that institution in Tasmania. That prosecution was brought against a corrections officer who took his life. There are no active prosecutions despite the appalling nature of the evidence, and that institution continues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We could go across the country to WA, where the Banksia Hill Detention Centre has been found by repeated Western Australian Supreme Court judgements to be acting in breach of WA laws in the prolonged torture of children. These are repeated findings of the Supreme Court that it's acting unlawfully against somewhat weak existing limitations on detaining children in WA. And the WA government has repeatedly ignored the findings from the WA Supreme Court. As my colleague Senator Cox will make clear, the tragedy, the loss of life, the loss of hope and the brutality of that particular institution identify the systemic unresolved failings in the WA youth justice system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We could turn our attention to the Northern Territory, where, while we are gathered here tonight in the Senate, I think we can have 99 per cent certainty that every child and every youth who will be jailed tonight under the Northern Territory's detention system, including some that are so notorious—pretty much every child in those children's jails will be a First Nations child. And the Territory government has just been taken by the CLP, who want to lower the age of criminal responsibility and put more First Nations kids in jail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We could turn our attention to Queensland, where tonight there will be dozens, perhaps hundreds, of kids held in Queensland police watch houses, because they keep putting more and more kids—the majority of them First Nations kids but not just First Nations kids—into the criminal justice system. They've seen an explosion of kids in jail, as a failed way of dealing with concerns about children's behaviour, sometimes criminal behaviour. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of New South Wales, there are multiple child jails. I visited many of them on numerous occasions when I was a state MP. I've seen the way those detention centres can snuff out hope for young people and drive what is often child removal. It leads to a child being removed from their family. I've seen the failings in the foster care system, or the state care system, where the child has been removed. The child finds themself in juvenile detention, which is a pipeline into the criminal justice system. That system is broken. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I will say, though, is that there are some lessons to learn from New South Wales. The proportion of kids in juvenile detention in New South Wales effectively halved over the last 12 years. It effectively halved because of a series of measures taken—sometimes against the flow of state politics there—that have seen more kids being found stable accommodation outside of jail. If we look at why kids end up in jail in WA, the Northern Territory, Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania, often it's because the courts know that there's no safe home for them to go to, apart from jail. The kids spend months on remand. They eventually get sentenced. Often it's a non-custodial sentence. They've been punished largely because there was no home for them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With all of that happening at the state and territory level, the Commonwealth government has done nothing—absolutely nothing. The federal Attorney-General will occasionally make some sad statement on Twitter to a collection of state and territory leaders. But who has all the international obligations to ensure that children aren't tortured and that the rights of the child are respected, that First Nations' rights are respected and that civil and political rights are respected? Which level of government has all those international obligations? It's not the Northern Territory government. It's not the WA government. It's not the New South Wales government. The international obligations—obligations to prevent torture, for example—all lie with the Commonwealth, and all the Commonwealth ever does is pass that responsibility on to the states. It washes it through the system and passes it through the states and says it's never any of the Commonwealth's business. What we say is that that passing of responsibility, that duckshoving, is failing generations of kids. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the evidence that states and territories by themselves will not fix the system. Yes, there's marginal improvement in New South Wales, but, even then, the systemic problems remain. The states and territories will not fix this problem by themselves. They've proven that time after time after time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this inquiry is calling for is a close examination of the benefits of and the need for enforceable national minimum standards for youth justice consistent with our international obligations, and they are Commonwealth obligations. It's about time the Commonwealth lifted its game. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the short time that these terms of reference have been available and circulated in the Senate, we did get some suggestions from Senator Thorpe's office to expand them. The suggestions are pretty much already covered by the terms of reference that I've read into the record, particularly that final term of reference, 'any other related matter'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that this inquiry needs to report by 28 November. It needs to be focused and it needs to deliver a pathway for reform that's going to get some kids—as many kids as we can—out of jail. That's going to push back against the flow of increased incarceration, and that's going to put an obligation on the Commonwealth to do more than just wring its hands. Whilst I fully respect and understand the rationale behind those amendments, they are covered by the existing terms of reference. We already face an enormous challenge in getting this inquiry done in a time that it can be considered by this parliament. I commend the motion.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="296215" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COX</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:50</span>):  As the co-sponsor of this motion, I echo and support my colleague Senator Shoebridge's comments. Time and time again we've seen governments across this country, as Senator Shoebridge said, put out a sad post or a sad Instagram reel talking about the loss of life—in my home state of Western Australia we've lost two children the last two months—to youth incarceration. There has been a flurry of people coming in and out of that state—politicians, former politicians, the previous director-general of corrective services—saying quite publicly that areas like Banksia Hill need reform, that areas like Unit 18 at Casuarina Prison need to be shut down because they are representative of torture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Children as young as 15 and 16 would rather harm themselves—kill themselves, in fact, by suicide—than be incarcerated or subjected to the torture and trauma in these places. With the death of Cleveland Dodd, the coronial inquest and the harrowing evidence that has already been shared as part of that process, it is beyond time. That a second child died in Western Australia less than two weeks ago means that, as Senator Shoebridge said, the time is up for the wringing of the hands by state governments and territory governments in this country. It is up here tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a mother—my youngest daughter is 10 years old, and I think about the age of criminal responsibility, which governments in this country would like to lower—I think about her being incarcerated. I can't remove that level of trauma from my mind. I don't think anybody in this chamber would agree with that. If this were your child, your niece, your nephew, your grandchild, would you want that for them? I hope we see in this chamber tonight an overwhelming amount of support for this motion, because we should. This is the human thing to do. It is with humility that Senator Shoebridge and I have brought this motion forward here tonight. We are frustrated when we hear the constant excuses about why they can't do anything.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that 70 per cent of the children that are incarcerated in youth justice—and we can't even use that word because it's not about justice; there is no justice for our children that are incarcerated in this country. Seventy per cent of them are First Nations children, but there are many others—children who are homeless, children who have been in the child protection system, children of migrants and refugees in this country, children who have experienced trauma.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we go to the cost. People will often argue with us that this is about a tough-on-crime approach. It costs $1 million per year to keep a child in custody. But we need to have some care and protection for our children in this country when one in six of them is living in poverty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of you in this place will sit around and talk about cost-of-living pressures and what it means. But these children and the love, the care and the protection they need is not in an institution. And we have to dismantle that pipeline. That will be your legacy in this place tonight as you vote for this motion. The humanity that you can restore for the future generations of children here in Australia is out here laid bare on the floor for you all, because everybody's watching—those folks watching at home tonight. We know the stories, the media articles that are being shared, about the reintroduction of spit hoods, the deaths of those children in my home state of Western Australia. Yet we will hear politicians provide the lame excuses time after time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These kids are complex. These kids have disabilities. Well, do you know what? They don't belong in a cage. That's the reality of this situation. Tonight Senator Shoebridge and I bring this motion because jailing is failing in this country. And it's not just a hashtag. This is about our children and the fact that we have the opportunity—the responsibility—to stop youth justice equalling incarceration and jailing the next generation of our children. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="259819" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  I am pleased to continue my remarks in regard to the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024, an important opportunity for our country to take the next step into a cleaner future for our nation and better local jobs for our regions. It's without question that our world is quickly changing, our global and national population is growing, economies are becoming more competitive, and we are moving towards a future where we get to decide: Do we want to fall behind on the global transition to net zero? Or do we want to invest in ourselves and ensure that Australians of today and of future generations are set up to have cheaper and cleaner energy? This is an opportunity to see Australians have more secure and better paid jobs. It's an opportunity for Australians to see their nation become a renewable energy superpower that's taking ambitious strides towards net zero, and it's a real opportunity for regional Queenslanders to lead this change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to discuss what is in this bill, because I have heard a lot of debate about what this bill means. But it's really clear that this bill provides a clear plan for the future of our industrial policy. It's a plan that looks to targeted public investment to attract private finance sectors that have comparative advantage in our net zero global economy. The bill would establish a national interest framework and introduce community benefit principles. The national interest framework would have two streams: the net zero transformation stream and the economic resilience and security stream. Together these streams would target sectors that could have a comparative advantage in the net zero economy and would look towards unlocking private investment for areas that align with Australia's national interest. This framework would have a transparency at its core and play a crucial role in attracting investment that will transform our economy. The community benefit principles are a second priority of this bill, and they're really important. Community benefit principles will be established to ensure that public investment and the private investment that it attracts will flow towards communities and benefit local workers and businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are five principles that are outlined in this legislation, and it beggars belief that those opposite would oppose these principles. They are, very simply: job security and safety, upskilling workforces, engaging collaboratively with local communities, strengthening industrial local supply chains, and demonstrating transparency and compliance in relation to the management of tax affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill, with the aim that our country becomes more competitive, productive and economically resilient, will be delivering $22.7 billion to ensure that we can have good, local, secure manufacturing jobs. Some of these commitments include $68 million over four years to attract key investments in key industries and to increase the contribution that Australia is making to innovation, science and digital capabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's the investment that we are making in our critical minerals that I think is crucial to this bill. A key commitment of the Future Made in Australia Bill which is significant for my home state of Queensland will be the new initiative funding critical minerals. It's an important step forward because we know that this is going to be a crucial industry as we transition to net zero, and it's really important to places like Queensland that have a good resources industry. Under the Future Made in Australia policy, critical minerals will receive production tax incentives to support downstream refining and processing of Australia's 31 critical minerals over the next decade. It is, again, an exciting opportunity for those regional towns to take hold of this transformation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other sector that we are looking at through this bill and through our investment in manufacturing is defence manufacturing. The Future Made in Australia Bill will also look towards broader investments in the government's growth agenda, including in defence priorities and manufacturing. To achieve this, the government will provide $100 million to attract and retain a skilled industrial workforce. This funding will support Australian shipbuilding and the delivery of conventionally armed nuclear powered submarines and create new jobs and experts within our defence sector. It is an important step forward to create an industrial base that is resilient, competitive and capable, and it's exactly what our government wants to do with the Future Made in Australia Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill before us today, the Future Made in Australia Bill, is a pivotal decision for our future. The Albanese Labor government wants to invest in and strengthen our economies, industries and supply chains. We want to make more things here in Australia. We want to create jobs for Australians and invest in our local communities, and we want to equip our workforce with the skills that we need for a modern and thriving economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the beginning of my contribution earlier today, it is so important that we get this right. There is no community that knows that more than the community that I live in in Cairns. We have two things at stake when it comes to this bill. We have a thriving tourism economy that is dependent on us getting to net zero. We also have an incredible defence and marine manufacturing sector ready to take to the next level. We have good local manufacturing jobs that rely on the reef. That is the economic base of our small regional community. It is really important that we support this bill, and that's why I'm doing that, to support the local community in Cairns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's disappointing to see, yet again, the Liberal and National parties voting against a future made in Australia and voting against all the opportunities that this bill could bring to somewhere like Far North Queensland. But this is the first opportunity for the new LNP candidate for Leichhardt, Jeremy Neal, to stand up for the community in Far North Queensland. He has a choice to make: does he support a future made in Australia or does he support Mr Peter Dutton? You can't do both. You can't support the LNP's position on a future made in Australia and vote down this bill that supports manufacturing and say that you support the Cairns Marine Precinct, the shipbuilders down on the wharf and the future of our tourism industry in Cairns. You can't do both. So this is the first chance for Jeremy Neal to stand up for the local community in Far North Queensland and say that he does support Labor's Future Made in Australia Bill and that he doesn't support the position of the Liberal-National coalition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is shameful that we again have this situation, where, no matter what single manufacturing job we talk about, the Liberal-National coalition is out to get those workers. They've been called rent-seekers. I don't see it that way. I've met with manufacturing workers in Cairns and across Queensland. They have a bright future under a Labor government, because we are looking forward to what a renewable energy future looks like for Queensland. What it means is that we're able to do two things. We're able to make more things here in Australia, and we're able to progress to a net zero economy and protect the Great Barrier Reef.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what these bills are about. I'm very pleased to be supporting them. I've always stood up for manufacturing workers, and I've always stood up against the attacks that manufacturing workers have suffered from those opposite. We'll continue to do that, and as a Labor government we'll continue to deliver what manufacturing workers need—good, local, secure jobs.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="306168" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KOVACIC</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:06</span>):  I rise to speak on the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 and the Future Made in Australia (Omnibus Amendments No. 1) Bill 2024. Sadly, these bills couldn't be further from the priorities that this government should be pursuing for the Australian people. We are opposing these bills, because, the more we hear about them and the more we hear about the detail, the clearer it becomes how wasteful some elements of this are. The bigger that government gets, the more intervention in the economy there is. That's what we don't need—more intervention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just another thread in the fabric of this government's agenda to slowly break down small businesses in this country and give special treatment to their mates in the union movement and in the industry super funds. It's time to focus on building small businesses, not bringing them down. Labor's policies on energy, industrial relations and tax are all making it harder for Australian small businesses to survive and making Australia a much harder place to do business. This is the opposite of what we need, and this bill just adds to that significant problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are now continually hearing more and more stories about the poor processes, the lack of scrutiny and the double standards that are within this program. The government continues to try to pick winners in the economy. They are spending billions of dollars of taxpayers' funds to do so, and they are pouring these billions of dollars into the economy in this way in the middle of a cost-of-living and inflationary crisis. We speak regularly about the fact that this government has poured $315 billion extra into the economy since they came to government. This is why we have homegrown inflation, this is why we have the problem with the stickiness of inflation in this country and this is why we are laggards when it comes to dealing with inflation compared to our global contemporaries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since Labor came to power, Australians have been paying more and more—and far more than people in comparable economies. Our core inflation is higher than the US, the UK, Canada, Japan, the EU, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland and New Zealand. We are now in six consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth per capita, the longest per capita recession in 50 years. Think about that. Living standards have fallen by 8.7 per cent, productivity has fallen by 6.3 per cent, household savings are down 10.2 percentage points and personal income taxes are 25.3 per cent higher.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not to mention what has happened to the mortgage repayments and rents of the everyday Australian. Gas is up 33 per cent, and electricity is up 14 per cent. That is even after the rebate has been added. Rents are up 16 per cent, health is up 11 per cent, education is also up 11 per cent, food is up 12 per cent and finance and insurance are up 17 per cent. A family with a mortgage of $750,000 is around $35,000 a year worse off. I'll probably hear you say, 'Yes, we've heard you say that a lot.' We say it a lot because it's really important. The average family with a mortgage of $750,000 in this country—just on that basis—is $35,000 a year worse off. That is extraordinary. We should be talking about that a lot more and we should understand the pain that the everyday Australian is feeling every single day as they struggle and juggle to pay their bills. It is unacceptable that Australians are in a full-blown cost-of-living crisis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been calling, along with so many of my colleagues, for this government to address the root causes of this inflation; however, the spending continues. The Future Made in Australia Bill does nothing to alleviate these pressures on struggling families and small businesses. In fact, this big-spending agenda and this big-spending bill are likely to make inflation worse. Just like households and small businesses, governments need to manage their budgets and live within their means, but the Albanese Labor government have shown just how truly out of depth and out of touch they are. This is not just a cost-of-living crisis; it is also a cost-of-doing-business crisis and it is hitting small businesses the hardest. Small businesses across the country, particularly in my state of New South Wales, are employing fewer staff and not opening for as long. Their costs are going up. Their prices are going up. They are paying more for their loans and, sadly, they have fewer people coming through the door to buy their goods and services, so they are shuttering their doors. They are closing down. Small businesses in this country are in crisis. They are closing down because they cannot afford to continue to operate. That is happening under the watch of this government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this bill do for small business? Does it do anything? No, it doesn't. In fact, it will make the problems that small businesses are facing even worse. One could call it another shot in the war against small business. That is unacceptable. Small businesses are the heavy lifters of our economy. They are the accountants, hairdressers, dentists, doctors, pharmacists, tradies, plumbers and electricians. They are people that hold our country together, yet for some reason this government continues to introduce policy mechanisms that make it harder for small businesses to survive in this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation puts the Treasurer and his department in the position to decide whether a sector of the Australian economy deserves investment. The Treasurer has never run a business, and he described his private career as 'six long, long months'. He will now be setting the conditions for businesses to operate and seek funding under his plan. 'Six long, long months'—think about that. Every small business operator in this country that struggles to pay their bills, pay their staff and keep costs down should have a think about that and the attitude of this government to what they're going through. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer's department will consider the investment against a very narrow set of criteria, and it has provided evidence to Senate estimates that key investments for Australia's energy future and sovereign capability, be they carbon capture and storage, gas, blue hydrogen, uranium or nuclear, will not be eligible and have not been considered as a part of this framework. The analysis to green-light these investments will be guided by a Treasurer who has never worked in business and a department of bureaucrats who, under this government, have shown that they have failed to understand Australian business, particularly Australian small businesses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, the so-called community benefit principles will entrench union involvement in the workplace and replicate many of the same social procurement policies that have enabled the CFMEU's corrupt conduct to flourish at the state level. We don't need more of that; we need less of that. That is not the way to build a healthy and productive economy where everybody gets a fair go. The Business Council have warned that these procurement rules are at risk of enabling this behaviour, while risking subsiding businesses Australia would never have a comparative advantage in. The BCA rightly points out that it is important because there are taxpayer dollars at stake. We have to remember there is no government money; it's all taxpayer money. All the money that is spent in this place is taxpayer money. The BCA have been clear that this is not the best path ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition are not the only ones raising these serious concerns, along with the BCA. Danielle Wood, the Chair of the Productivity Commission—the government's key economic adviser, appointed by Jim Chalmers—has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If we are supporting industries that don't have a long-term competitive advantage, that can be an ongoing cost. It diverts resources, that's workers and capital, away from other parts of the economy where they might generate high value uses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We risk creating a class of businesses that is reliant on government subsidies, and that can be very effective in coming back for more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When asked whether Future Made in Australia contained tax reform, Ms Wood explicitly said, 'No, it is not a tax reform.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a lot of issues here. In another example, an eminent economist, Professor Richard Holden, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:17</span>):  The Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 provides a legislative framework for parts of the government's Future Made in Australia policy. This provides for an investment of $22.7 billion over the next 10 years to 'help Australia become an indispensable part of the global economy as the world transforms to net zero emissions and undergoes the most significant changes since the industrial revolution'. The government talks about maximising the economic and industrial benefits of the move to net zero and securing Australia's place in a changing global economic and strategic landscape. Specifically, the following claim is made by the government:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Given our critical and abundant natural endowments and skilled workforce, Australia is well positioned to strengthen priority supply chains and become an indispensable part of the net zero global economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation are big supporters of the first part of that statement. Australia is blessed with abundant and substantial mineral resources, and it's our obligation to share those with the world so other countries can enjoy the standard of living we have—that is, we used to have it. Now our economy is in a race to the bottom, with the Greens, teals and Labor in a race to see how many wealth-generating projects they can shut down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Future Made in Australia agenda includes broader investments in the government's growth agenda, including critical technologies, defence priorities, skills in priority sectors, a competitive business environment and reforms to better attract and deploy investment—in particular, projects where some level of domestic capability is necessary for efficient delivery of economic resilience and security and the private sector will not deliver the necessary investment in the sector in the absence of government support. That's an important point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been working with the project sponsor of Capricorn Steel, a steel park project in northern Queensland, which I will speak more of in a moment. This project, known also as Project Iron Boomerang, includes a railway, a port and new energy-efficient ships. This is a $50 billion project, initially, which is to be entirely financed through private equity, who have the money ready to go but will not commit it, because they don't trust the Australian government. After watching a litany of cancelled projects—like Adani, where a billionaire from India wanted to invest $17 billion in Australia, and we did our best as a country and as the state of Queensland to keep him out—long legal delays and general incompetence, financiers are taking their money elsewhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why the government is now creating an investment pathway to get things built again. It's the government or nothing. The prime function of the government is to build infrastructure projects that allow private enterprise to grow the economy and raise the wealth and prosperity of all Australians—to improve productivity in a way that protects the natural environment. This bill adds a layer on top, which is that the development must be net zero friendly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation doesn't believe in the United Nations' globalist net zero agenda. There is no empirical scientific data, no logical scientific points and no policy basis. We've seen that repeatedly. We believe it involves a massive transfer of wealth from everyday citizens into the pockets of the world's predatory billionaires—billionaire parasites sucking solar and wind subsidies. It forms a highly regressive tax on the poor using electricity. We wonder when the Left signed on to a crony capitalist agenda that hurts everyday Australians for no environmental benefit. That's a separate issue. One Nation does agree the national environment should be protected. We are stewards of the most fragile ecosystem in the world, and we must act with care. This bill doesn't actually mention good stewardship of the natural environment, but it's okay; One Nation does that as part of our core party values.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Future Made in Australia policy includes the following broad stated aims: firstly, attracting investment in key industries through the national investment framework, streamlining approval processes for investment and encouraging private sector investment in sustainable industries; secondly, investing in net zero industries and increasing the demand for Australia's green exports; thirdly, strengthening resources and economic security by investing in resources and critical mineral supply chains, as well as investing in manufacturing of clean energy technology; and, fourthly, investing in new technologies and capabilities, reforming tertiary education, providing a training and skills pipeline for Future Made in Australia priority industries, strengthening defence capability and increasing drought and disaster resilience, among other things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill establishes the National Interest Framework, to be used for sector assessments which will determine which sectors of the economy are ones in which Australia could have a competitive advantage in a net zero economy and that require government investment, or where some degree of domestic capacity is required for economic resilience and security. The government's stated guidelines in this section include a community benefit test which includes promoting safe, secure and well-paid work; developing skilled and inclusive workforces; working with communities to achieve positive outcomes, particularly First Nations communities and those affected by the transition to net zero; and strengthening domestic industrial capabilities, including local supply chains. This sounds like socialism—government wanting to control.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation agrees with the intent. In particular, the industrial and mining sectors are being hollowed out through net zero measures to the detriment of the workers, unionists and their families. If the government are telling the truth, they will be able to rectify what they've already done in hollowing out the bush and the mining and manufacturing. Otherwise, fine Australian workers will join the tent cities that have sprung up under this Labor government. It should be pointed out that local supply chains are in fact part of the United Nations 2030 sustainability goals. It is more commonly called short supply chains. This goal encourages local supply of all goods and services, especially food. This may seem fine until you realise that, under this goal, anything which can't be supplied locally will not be available at all. That's the design, except that it will be available to the nomenklatura who can afford the carbon dioxide tax on long supply chains. If Australians want to live in a world that even vaguely resembles the world we grew up in, local manufacturing is essential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seems to represent a newfound realisation by the Albanese Labor government that their union bosses and union members are running out of jobs, the economy is tanking and the next election is moving way out of reach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation can get on board with making things here again. We can't, though, get on board with all the net zero nonsense in this bill. The bill is written generally, allowing the minister wide powers to completely stuff things up. I don't see this as any different to the general stuffing-up the Albanese government is already doing. Giving it more ways to make mistakes seems like a bad idea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill has some good qualities. The economic resilience and security stream relates to sectors where Australia requires a degree of domestic capacity and resilience for domestic, economic or security reasons, and there's an absence of private sector investment with that government support. The provisions around this section are quite extensive and seem to be a genuine attempt to provide for Australia's sovereign industrial capacity—without using the word 'sovereign', of course!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give you an example of a project that fits the economic resilience and security rules like a glove and provides breadwinner, family friendly, secure jobs for tens of thousands of Australians. Capricorn Steel is a project to create an Australian steel industry using new, zero-emission steel plants located at Abbot Point near Townsville and Port Hedland in Western Australia. Boomerang ships would take beautiful Queensland coking coal around to Port Hedland in Western Australia, where it'll be used with their iron ore to produce Australian steel. This will be the world's highest-quality steel, produced at 10 to 15 per cent less than China—the cheapest quality steel in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From Port Hedland this steel can be exported to markets in the subcontinent—India and Europe. The development crescent of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia will become the world's largest steel market over the next 20 years; Australia is perfectly placed to capitalise on that. Those ships will return to the Port of Gladstone carrying iron ore which will be combined with Australian coking coal to create a second steel park at Abbot Point. From there, Inland Rail can take this steel anywhere in Australia to help meet Australia's steel needs—steel that is critical to net zero, housing, construction and our modern lifestyle, steel that is critical to Australia's defence capability. Abbot Point, or the Port of Gladstone, is perfectly situated to export this steel to Asia, China and the United States.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Development of a railway across the Top End to open up areas currently served by road as well as new port facilities and new high-efficiency shipping are all projects that satisfy the development criteria in this bill—plus a water pipeline, plus a communications link to open up Central Australia and northern Queensland, the Northern Territory and northern Western Australia. Capricorn Steel and Project Iron Boomerang will add $100 billion to Australia's gross domestic product, provide 40,000 secure breadwinner jobs and provide $25 billion in government revenue every year. Capricorn Steel will be emission free, for those who believe this global warming nonsense. Every ton of steel produced in the zero-emission steel plants to be constructed at Port Hedland and Abbot Point will save two tonnes of carbon dioxide from steel produced elsewhere. That's a reduction in carbon dioxide production of 88 million tonnes a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no net zero without steel. Yet all the messaging coming from the government around this bill is nothing but net zero, which is nonsense. I get it: even net zero carpetbaggers are running out of interest in this failed net zero scam, so the government has to steal taxpayers' money to keep net zero going.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation has no confidence this bill will achieve anything positive for Australia. If the government wants to move the provisions around economic resilience and security into a new bill, with Infrastructure Australia in charge, One Nation would be delighted to support those measures.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:28</span>):  I've only recently joined my parliamentary colleagues in the Senate, but in this short time I've already witnessed the important and ambitious work being done by the Albanese government. In my first speech I spoke about what government is for and the importance of making our time in government count. Today I rise extremely proudly in support of the Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 to do exactly that. This bill is ambitious and long-lasting. It is exactly the kind of policy that's crucial for investing in our workplaces and securing our sovereign capability. It's about shaping the future we want for our country—a future where our incredibly skilled workers make more things right here in Australia.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GROGAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  Today I rise to celebrate a milestone. It's not just a moment in our party's history but a testament to the ongoing fight for gender equity in Australia. Thirty years ago, the Australian Labor Party made a bold and transformative decision and committed to affirmative action for women. The decision to introduce quotas for women for preselection was not just about increasing the numbers and not just about a percentage; it was about ensuring that women's voices were heard and that women's voices, perspectives and leadership were central to the decisions shaping our nation. It was about capturing the best and the brightest of our party and putting them forward into those positions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our society has changed and developed, and the Labor Party has changed and developed alongside it. When we reflect on the past three decades, we can see what a profound impact this policy has had. The leadership shown by the Labor Party has made a fundamental difference to our democracy and our representation. Thirty years ago, women in politics were rarities, and almost invisible, even though they were in those positions. But today women are at the forefront of our party. They are driving the change. They are leading with vision, integrity and courage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This didn't happen by chance. It wasn't just a whim. It happened because our party understood true representation and the true power, courage and intelligence of the women within the party whom we needed to bring to the fore. The affirmative action policy was a recognition of the historical structural barriers that women had faced whereby they were excluded from power and from decision-making. The first federal government to have a majority of women in it is the one we are standing in now, and that is a huge development. It is a huge leap forward. It is a huge advantage for our society to have our community represented appropriately at the highest points of decision-making.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that being in government is about choices, and the Albanese government chooses to back women. In our time in government, in the last 2½ years, we have put economic gender equity at the centre of our government's work. We've made child care cheaper, we've extended paid parental leave, we've extended the single parenting payments, we've delivered tax cuts that are better and fairer for women, we've delivered wage increases to feminised industries, and the gender pay gap is at an all-time low. But we still see underrepresentation of women in some key areas and we continue to face challenges in achieving true equality. Our commitment must remain strong and it must evolve to meet the new challenges that we see as our society continues to change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must also acknowledge that, by fostering a culture of inclusivity and diversity, the benefits of affirmative action go beyond gender equity. We strengthened our party's democracy by making these changes, and that flows on to the country. We ensure that the voices of all Australians, regardless of their gender, their race or their background, are heard and respected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In celebrating 30 years of affirmative action, we honour those women who fought for this policy, and we honour those women who are now in leadership positions by the nature of this policy and their pathway. We recommit ourselves to the principles of fairness, equity and justice that underpin our party's values.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a momentous week. It's been 30 years since that policy was brought to bear, and it has shown us what is possible when we dare to take bold action. Let the next 30 years be defined by even greater progress, by even more courageous steps towards equality and by a Labor Party that continues to lead the way in building a fairer and more just Australian society for all.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="266499" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUME</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  One of my very favourite parts of being a senator for Victoria is getting out and about to visit different parts of the state, getting off some of the major highways and out of the big towns and seeing parts of the state that perhaps I might not have seen if I had done a different job. Just recently, I had the pleasure of visiting the electorate of Monash with our Liberal candidate, Mary Aldred, to join her in the beautiful part of Victoria that she calls home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mary is an extraordinary woman. I have known her for 20 years. She's an exemplary leader and has been an advocate for her community for decades. She was the founding CEO of the Committee for Gippsland, an organisation which, under her leadership, grew from being a startup to having over 100 local employers as members. She also worked in the franchise sector, so she has a deep understanding of the pressures and the operations of small businesses. I hope she'll soon be able to continue her support for small businesses in the parliament, because seeing her in action on the ground proved she is an extraordinary person and will be the amazing representative that the people of Monash need and deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mary and I travelled right around the West Gippsland region to meet with small-business owners, farmers and community representatives. Hearing from these individuals gave me a real insight into the challenges that are being faced in that region and in regional Australia more broadly, whether it be in relation to the cost of living or, particularly, the cost of doing business. While we heard many things, there was one commonality that everyone that we met shared: they absolutely loved what they did and they loved the community that they lived in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We started by meeting with representatives from the Corinella &amp; District Community Centre. We met with Kerryn, Janice and Jan to tour the facility and to hear about the good work that they do in their town. This centre has been pivotal in providing practical support and relief to local residents in the Bass Coast Shire region and in offering essential services such as food assistance and community outreach programs. They told us that they've seen an increase in demand for their services because of the high cost of living. Indeed, people who they have never had to service before have been coming through their doors. They also told us that, as much as people are struggling to make ends meet, it's very difficult for some people to reach out for assistance because they're too proud and they never thought that they would need help just to put food on the table. These are people who work hard every day to make a living, and they're left with very little after they've paid their mortgage or their energy bills. As I said, they are people that have never sought help before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sentiment about how much tougher it is for Australians to get by is one that was shared by almost everyone that we heard from at roundtables that Mary hosted with me in San Remo, in Inverloch, in Warragul and in Moe. Local small businesses told us that they had to adapt their businesses in response to the change in consumer behaviour from the cost-of-living crisis. Not only are these business owners facing uncertainty on the demand side but they also said that they're facing increasing overheads and rents and, in particular, are being wrapped up in red tape and complex industrial relations laws—specifically in how complicated the awards system is. That came up over and over again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just our small-business owners that are facing these pressures; it's our farmers too. The electorate of Monash is an agricultural powerhouse not just in Victoria but in the nation. We visited Fankhauser Apples just outside Drouin, an extraordinary place. They are producers of many types of apples, but Gippsland Golds are my absolute favourite. I highly recommend them, but they're hard to find in the supermarkets. We also met with a group of farmers from the region and were kindly hosted by Durkin Produce, in Thorpdale, which Mary proudly told me is Australia's potato capital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During these meetings, these primary producers and farmers talked about the challenges facing their industries, particularly higher taxes in the form of the biosecurity levy and the heavy-vehicle road-user charge. One farmer told me his costs have gone up 28 per cent in the last year alone, and he followed it up by saying: 'The cost of doing business in Australia is simply unviable. It's horrific.' We saw the farmer rally that took place on the lawns just outside parliament today. We must understand that, without our farmers, there is simply no food. We cannot understand why Labor are intent on making business impossible for our farmers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mary understands the pressures that farmers and small businesses in regional Victoria face because she has spent so much of her time, so much of her life, dedicated to providing a voice for these industries. She knows that only a Dutton coalition government will be able to get Australia back on track, that a Dutton coalition government will have the policies to address the concerns that were raised with us and that she is clearly the best person to advocate for the people of Monash in the next parliament, and I hope that she will be part of a Dutton coalition government. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  You'll often hear in the media commentary that Western Australian voters were pivotal to the election of the Albanese Labor government. Well, if WA voters are the ones who handed the Prime Minister the keys to the Lodge, they have every right to be the ones that hand him and his government their report card. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Australians, like all Australians, have a fairly straightforward test for the government of the day. Are we better off than we were three years ago? Western Australians are asking themselves, 'Has my savings account grown or dwindled? Has my mortgage burden improved or worsened? Is the day-to-day running of my small business easier or harder?' To all these questions and many more, the answer is a frustrating no. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The data shows that our national economy and the economy in my home state are teetering on the edge of recession, with many families hurting, as this government has failed to do the job it was elected to do. Just take a look at how families are struggling to build their savings accounts, with the average household saving ratio at just 0.9 per cent. This is a confronting statistic. It means that many Australians are living pay cheque to pay cheque and that they are finding it nearly impossible to save for that next big purchase, like a car or home repairs. In many cases, they are one unexpected payment away from serious financial strife. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't because Australians can't manage their money; it's because Labor can't manage the nation's economy. Australians are struggling to make ends meet in an economy held in a vice grip by Labor's sticky, homegrown inflation crisis. Western Australians in particular are feeling the impact of this cost-of-living crisis more than most, with the Perth consumer price index increasing by 4.6 per cent in the last year, well ahead of the national average of 3.8 per cent. In fact, in the June quarter alone, Perth had a 2.1 per cent CPI increase. That's twice the national figure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the rising expenses of the weekly grocery shop or fuel costs that have eaten away at household savings but also the surging increases in mortgages, home loans and rents that are making everyday life a financial battle. I recently obtained data from the Reserve Bank of Australia that reveals the extent to which more and more homeowners cannot keep up with their mortgage repayments, and the numbers are damning for the government. The share of borrowers in 90-day arrears in Western Australia has surged from 0.3 per cent to 0.62 per cent over the last year alone. That's a 44 per cent jump. That's the second worst in the nation, second only to Victoria at 0.67 per cent, with increases in every single state and territory in the last year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To emphasise the point, Gosnells in Perth is now ranked within the top eight suburbs in Australia with the lowest share of borrowers with a high mortgage burden sitting at 15 per cent, according to the RBA. The median price of a home in Gosnells has jumped by 32.5 per cent, and rents have climbed by 20.8 per cent. That's a microcosm of what is happening across WA and across the whole country as housing and mortgage affordability continues to worsen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These cost-of-living pressures are in tandem with a slowing economy and falling consumer and business confidence. We are now hearing of rising unemployment on top of that, making the complete picture of the economic pain being felt all the more severe. In Westpac's most recent consumer sentiment bulletin, published just yesterday, the bank's index reported a fall of 0.5 per cent, punctuating yet another month of falling consumer sentiment as Australians grow more fearful of the state of our economy. To quote the bulletin, small improvements in some areas of the economy 'were more than offset by a loss of confidence' around others. The report continues:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The less confident outlook for the economy is also sparking fears about potential job loss. The … Unemployment Expectations Index rose 3.7% to 138.4 in September, up 11% since April and now materially above its long run average of 129 …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To put it plainly: on top of the added stress of whether households can afford their next mortgage repayment, they are now more fearful than they have been for a long time about their job security. Those fears aren't unfounded, as many businesses are struggling to stay solvent, let alone maintain staff. Why has Labor made it so hard for WA families? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>
