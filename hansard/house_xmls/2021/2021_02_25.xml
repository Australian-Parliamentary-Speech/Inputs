In the first instance, the government is prioritising the development of interim national environmental standards for matters of national environmental significance, reflecting the existing requirements of the EPBC Act. This will make the Commonwealth's existing rules clear. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is continuing its program of reform to private health insurance, which is making private health insurance simpler and more affordable. The most recent premium round process, which delivered the lowest average premium increase in 20 years, demonstrates our success.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Announced in the 2020-21 budget as part of the reform program, from 1 April 2021 the maximum age of dependants for private health insurance policies will able to increase from 24 to 31 years. For the first time, there will also be an opportunity for insurers to offer policies with no age limit for dependants with a disability.</span>

It will be easier for them to transition from being on their parents' cover to buying their own when Lifetime Health Cover applies at the age of 31. While this reform most obviously benefits the younger adults who will be covered as dependants, their transition to their own adult cover after they turn 31 years of age will over the medium term contribute to making private health insurance more sustainable for everyone.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the coronavirus pandemic the government has acted decisively to cushion the blow for households and businesses. We have provided $251 million in direct support to households and businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The pandemic caused a once-in-a-lifetime disruption to the labour market, and we have used our comprehensive welfare system to provide emergency support to Australians impacted by other crises, including through the coronavirus supplement and expanded access to JobSeeker payments and related payments. Throughout this period, our values have not changed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government strongly believes the key to improving people's living standards and reducing welfare dependency is job creation and having the right incentives to ensure there is a workforce ready to take those jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to our JobMaker plan to support businesses and provide the employment opportunities Australians need, we are strengthening our income support system. This bill will provide a permanent increase to working age payments provided to over 1.95 million Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This $50 increase is the largest increase to employment payments in more than 35 years. It will be provided to jobseekers, student payment recipients, parenting payment recipients and youth payment recipients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This $9 billion increase to payments balances the need to ensure income support payments encourage and enable workforce participation with the need for the welfare system to be fiscally sustainable for future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This rate increase will occur from 1 April 2021 and is in addition to the usual indexation of payments, which will take effect on 20 March 2021.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The $50 per fortnight increase will apply to the JobSeeker payment, youth allowance, the parenting payment, Austudy, special benefit, partner allowance and widow allowance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The increase will flow on to Abstudy (living allowance), farm household allowance and payments made under the Department of Veterans' Affairs education system.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also permanently increases the income free area to $150 per fortnight for the JobSeeker payment and youth allowance (other) from 1 April 2021, allowing people to keep more of what they earn as they reconnect with the labour market, and encourage recipients to take the first step into employment without impacting their payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill extends the waiver of the ordinary waiting period for the parenting payment, the JobSeeker payment and youth allowance for a further three months until 30 June 2021.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also extends to 30 June 2021 expanded access to the JobSeeker payment and youth allowance (other) for persons who find themselves having to self‑isolate or care for someone who is self-isolating due to the pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also extends the portability period for certain age pensioners and recipients of the disability support pension (for people with significant disability) until 30 June 2021. This means pensioners unable to return to, or depart from, Australia within 26 weeks due to travel restrictions resulting from COVID-19 will have their entitlement maintained until 30 June 2021, as if they had been able to return home as planned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The policy delivered by this bill carries a cost of approximately $9 billion to 2024-25, including approximately $700 million in 2020-21.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will further strengthen our income support system in a fair and sustainable way. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—Section 119.2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 makes it an offence to enter or remain in an area in a foreign country that has been declared by the Minister for Foreign Affairs under section 119.3 of the same act. These are extraordinary provisions which were introduced in late 2014 in response to an extraordinary set of circumstances. At the time, our security agencies advised us that approximately 160 Australians had travelled to Syria and Iraq to join extremist groups and participate in the then ongoing conflicts in those countries. These measures, along with a number of other measures that were introduced at the same time, were designed to deal with the threat posed by returning foreign fighters and the problem of Australian nationals heading over to Syria and Iraq in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To date, there have only been two areas declared by the Minister for Foreign Affairs under section 119.3 of the Criminal Code: al-Raqqa province in Syria and the Mosul district in Iraq. Both of those declarations have since been revoked. Only one person has been charged under section 119.2, and the individual charged was ultimately not prosecuted for the declared areas offence but for other, more serious offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the limited use of these powers, the significant developments in Syria and Iraq since 2014 and the introduction of a range of new powers over the last six years, a number of submitters told the committee that the declared areas provisions were no longer necessary and so should be repealed. Ultimately, the committee has unanimously agreed with the position put to the committee by government agencies that the provisions should not be repealed at this time. However, we've made it very clear that these provisions should be reassessed by the committee over the course of the next three years and that, unless the parliament determines that the provisions remain necessary, the declared areas provisions should be repealed on 7 September 2024.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also recommended that the Criminal Code should be amended to allow Australian citizens to request an exemption from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to travel to a declared area. This would introduce an important degree of flexibility to a regime that is anything but flexible and allow, in appropriate circumstances, Australians to travel to declared areas for legitimate reasons that are currently not covered by the exemptions listed in section 119.2.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the outset of these brief remarks, the declared areas provisions are extraordinary provisions that were introduced in response to an extraordinary set of circumstances. We must never lose sight of that and, as the committee recognises in this bipartisan report, the moment these provisions cease to be necessary, they should be repealed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank the non-government and government submitters to this inquiry. However, I would like to make a brief comment in closing about the contribution of the Australian Federal Police to the inquiry, which was generally very helpful. I do not think that the parliament or the Australian people are well served by the Australian Federal Police's description of the declared areas regime as just another 'tool in the toolbox'. That was the expression used by the Australian Federal Police during the committee's public hearing. Regrettably, the committee has become accustomed to the Department of Home Affairs using that banal expression to describe a whole range of extraordinary powers that have been introduced over the last seven years to deal with very specific threats. The language that we use to describe powers like the declared areas provisions matters. The department and all government agencies should not lose sight of the fact that many of the powers this parliament has provided to agencies, especially since 2001, are among the most extraordinary powers that any parliament in any democracy has given to its security and intelligence agencies. We need to keep that steadily in mind. The powers need to be regarded as extraordinary not just by this parliament, and not just by the Australian people, but also by the agencies that have been given these powers in the first place.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  The National Collecting Institutions Legislation Amendment Bill 2020 has been presented by the government as innocuous, a simple tidying-up job that will make the legislation which governs six of the national collecting institutions more consistent and allow them to attract more private philanthropy. But you can forgive me for treating anything this government does in the arts portfolio with a healthy dose of scepticism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The national institutions have not escaped damage wreaked by this government's years-long campaign to undermine and underfund the arts in Australia. The worst impact on the national institutions came in the 2015-16 financial year, when the government imposed a three per cent efficiency target on some institutions, in addition to the existing efficiency dividend, which resulted in an estimated $20 million loss of funding across the board. It threw many of these institutions into turmoil, including the National Library, which, for a time, had to stop adding new content to its popular online archive service, Trove. Although the situation has slightly improved now, we are still seeing job cuts and a reduction in services at the national collecting institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen this over and again with this government and the arts: they put a wrecking ball through important institutions, as they did with the Australia Council and the Catalyst fund under George Brandis, and then they paper over the damage and pretend that nothing's happened: 'Nothing to see here.' Well, lasting damage has been done. The arts in this country, including the national institutions, were hit hard by COVID, but the truth is that the sector was already very fragile before that, with repeated funding cuts and endless rounds of applications proving too much for many in the sector. Many people who had been in the industry for decades left it. So, when this government tries to say that the arts is in a worse state because of COVID, it's true, but it's not the full story. The damage had already been done by a series of Liberal ministers, and they didn't do enough to help when COVID hit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, although portrayed by the government as simple, is actually quite complex in terms of the many different changes it makes to the legislation which governs the national collecting institutions. Schedule 1 of this bill contains a major change which affects all of the institutions. It's a change to the investment mandate of the institutions, so that they may invest donated funds in higher-risk, higher-return instruments and assets. Currently, under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013, the institutions can only invest any funds in excess of their operating costs in very conservative ways, which limit the return they can obtain. According to the bill's explanatory memorandum, this is a problem in attracting private philanthropy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Representatives from all six of the national institutions were called to a short Senate inquiry into this bill and were asked what their views were on this part of the bill. According to those present, this flexibility was at the request of the institutions themselves, many of whom have to kept their donated funds in cash due to the restrictions of the PGPA Act. In the ultra-low interest rate environment that we currently find ourselves in, you can appreciate that this would be a source of frustration both to the institutions and to their donors. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's national collecting institutions have never had the same kind of culture of private philanthropy as their peers in the United States and the United Kingdom, and it is appropriate that they be given the means to attract more donated funds. Labor could never and would never stand in the way of more funding for our national collecting institutions, and we're reassured that the request for this change in investment mandate came from the institutions themselves. Of course, it's important that this flexibility comes with a high level of oversight and prudence in terms of the investments chosen, so it's good to hear that some of the institutions have already started putting together investment plans to be approved by their boards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do, however, want to strike one note of caution. This line from the explanatory memorandum, explaining why the government wants this change to happen, should give us pause:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This focus of actively seeking philanthropic support aligns with the Government’s broader position of encouraging NCIs to increase their financial sustainability through non-government sources of funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, let me tell you what that sounds like to me. The government wants the institutions to attract more private money so it can give them even less. That's the first I've heard of this government's 'broader position', and it doesn't give me any confidence that this government won't use the bill, once passed, to say to the institutions, 'Oh, well, you can go and attract more private philanthropy now, so don't come to us asking for more public funds.' To me, that sounds like exactly the kind of thing this government would do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the Senate inquiry hearing, the Office for the Arts denied that this was an objective of the bill and said no modelling had been done to predict what the private-public funding mix would look like once this bill was passed. But it remains a concern to me. Why do I worry about this? Because we've already seen it happen in other parts of the arts sector. As we see a systemic withdrawal of public funds for the arts by the federal government, private philanthropists are asked again and again to step into the breach—and they do. I expect they will continue to do so, but it is not their role to support the entire national arts ecosystem; nor could they afford to do that. That's the government's role, and never more so than when it comes to our national collecting institutions. These institutions—the Australian National Maritime Museum, the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Library of Australia, the National Museum of Australia and the National Portrait Gallery of Australia—are the keepers and promoters of Australian stories. With the exception of the Maritime Museum, they're based in Canberra, the home of our federal parliament. They're a big part of Canberra's tourism economy and local employment. The role for the federal government in supporting these institutions is clear, and the passage of this bill must not be seen as a green light to the government to withdraw even more public funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of the bill is where things get pretty complex. Its stated intent is to standardise the legislation that governs the national collecting institutions so that everyone has the same legislative framework. It makes sense—except it means that some of the institutions will be subject to rules and ministerial powers they've never had before. I'm going to pull out the most important of these and then discuss them in turn. The biggest example is in the case of the National Gallery and the National Library. For the first time, these two institutions will be subject to ministerial direction. While it is true that all the other collecting institutions are already subject to ministerial directions, this expansion is not a small thing. Consider the National Gallery, for example. We all remember <span style="font-style:italic;">Blue Poles</span>, which caused tremendous controversy when purchased in 1973 for A$1.3 million. That purchase, which had to be ticked off by then Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, was seen as outlandish and overpriced. That painting, considered a master work of American abstract expressionism, is now worth up to $350 million—a pretty good return for the taxpayer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Art is meant to challenge us, and that's not always popular. Sometimes, in fact, it can be very unpopular. That's why we should always tread carefully when talking about politicians having a say in deciding what is and what is not good art and how galleries or indeed libraries should run. Importantly, this bill states that these ministerial directions must be of a general nature only. This is an important safeguard, ensuring that the minister cannot issue a direction—for example, that this or that artist should not be in the national collection. Nevertheless, the ministerial direction power should be used very infrequently and with extreme caution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is reassured somewhat by evidence given by Stephen Arnott, First Assistant Secretary of the Office of the Arts, that not a single ministerial direction has been issued to any national collecting institution since the current government came to power in 2013. It is worth noting, though, that such a direction would not be disallowable by parliament were one to be made. That gives the minister quite a lot of power, and it should be used very, very sparingly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of this schedule worth drawing attention to is the financial thresholds for acquisitions that trigger a need for ministerial approval. Such thresholds already exist—for example, for the National Gallery it's $10 million—so that in itself is not controversial. What this bill does though is shift the thresholds that apply to each of the institutions from legislation to regulation. This lowers the bar for changes to be made to the thresholds, as they do not have to be passed through parliament. It was welcome though, as part of the Senate inquiry process, to have confirmation from the department that such regulations would be disallowable by the parliament should they be remade—for example, if the $10 million threshold for the National Gallery were reduced to an unacceptably low level as a way of increasing ministerial oversight of purchases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third part, which will be of interest to some of my Canberra colleagues, is that for the first time the National Gallery will be allowed to store its collection outside the ACT. It is the only institution that does not currently have this flexibility. The department gave evidence that this was purely to save on costs, as the availability of large storage facilities in the ACT is limited. As the legislation is written, it should not mean that there will be any change to the works on display at the Gallery's home in Canberra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the sum, after examining this legislation through the committee process, Labor is satisfied that it has been drafted with sufficient input from the institutions and is heartened that there are no parts of the bill that the institutions object to. Labor will be supporting this bill. In doing so, however, it's important to note that no amount of legislation can fix the longer term structural underfunding of our national collecting institutions that has been a feature of this current government. If you really want to make a difference, that's where you need to start. With that in mind, I move the second reading amendment circulated in my name:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  The national collecting institutions are a key component of our cultural and creative economy. The national collecting institutions attracted more than 4.5 million onsite visitors in 2018-19 and comprise the following institutions: the National Gallery of Australia, the National Museum of Australia, the National Portrait Gallery, the National Library of Australia, the National Film and Sound Archive, and the Australian National Maritime Museum. Any Canberra visitor will know these intimately because they are the backbone of why you visit Canberra. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These institutions house some of this country's greatest treasures and finest works of art. They also preserve and maintain our most important historical documents, including films, photographs and everything in-between. The work of these museums, galleries and libraries is central to the telling of Australia's story. We invest in, preserve and cherish these institutions and their articles so future generations too can enrich themselves with an understanding of Australia's story. It is important that we work in this place to ensure that these institutions are sustained into the future and can continue to play an important and robust role in Australian society. That is why the Morrison government is bolstering the investment powers of the national collecting institutions and promoting efficiencies by harmonising administrative inconsistencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Alongside strong government funding, the national collecting institutions benefit greatly from public philanthropic partnerships. This includes donations from individuals, foundations, bequests and other entities that kindly and generously support the arts, culture and history that these institutions curate and maintain. In 2019-20 alone, the six institutions received approximately $14 million in donations. The National Collecting Institutions Legislation Amendment Bill 2020 amends the six acts that govern the handling of donations for the national collecting institutions to provide them with greater investment powers in relation to their donated revenue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This move is directly in line with feedback we have received from the philanthropic sector as to how they wish to see their donations handled. It will allow these institutions to develop a tailored investment policy which factors in the funds available to invest, the governing body's appetite for risk, and both internal and external financial expertise. Such investment policies are to be made publicly accessible via the institution's website. It is important to note that these investment changes apply only to private and philanthropic donations. They do not impact the ordinary appropriations of the national collecting institutions or alter their base funding. Likewise, this bill does not force national collecting institutions to invest, nor does it override current or future obligations attached to donations. The bill will instead allow the national collecting institutions the autonomy to better optimise their donations for their long-term benefit and sustainability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill otherwise seeks to rectify inconsistencies between the enabling acts for each national collecting institution. Amongst other minor changes, this includes standardising delegation powers, term limits for members of governing bodies, and the removal of ministerial approval requirements related to routine financial transactions and asset disposal, such as utility contracts. These amendments are grounded in improving the efficiency and productivity of our national collecting institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is attuned to the views of the philanthropic sector and keen to support the modernisation of our national collecting institutions. That is why we're proposing this important bill. As it currently stands, the national collecting institutions face legislative restrictions on their operations and governance, such as simple expenditure requiring ministerial approval, or blocks on how they invest donated funds. For example, the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 currently restricts national collecting institutions from investing donated funds in high-return investments, which greatly diminishes the impact of donation receipts. National collecting institutions are instead currently restricted to government backed securities like bonds and bank deposits. This disadvantages our national collecting institutions in the highly competitive market of philanthropic funds, with non-public institutions achieving greater returns and thus having more funds available to fund new programs. This can give the outward appearance to philanthropists that the national collecting institutions will achieve less impact with donations than their non-public counterparts. Indeed, the feedback from governing bodies is that current arrangements hamper their ability to realise the full financial potential of the philanthropic support they receive. This ultimately undermines many of the very successful fundraising strategies that these institutions have implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who is on the foundation board of an education not-for-profit, I know how important it is for an institution to make every donated dollar work hard for both the donor and the recipient institution. It's an incredibly competitive market out there. The generosity of donors is hotly contested, and it's important that donors feel their money is going to have a significant impact, for the values they care about and for the institutions they support. Allowing the national collecting institutions to set their own investment policies will ensure they're on an even footing with non-public institutions in the market for philanthropic funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill sits alongside the Morrison government's strong track record of supporting our national collecting institutions. In 2020-21 the government provided $249 million in funding to the six national collecting institutions. That's way more than their philanthropic support. The National Gallery of Australia, here in Canberra, which houses approximately 160,000 works of art, is one of the major beneficiaries. Please go and see the fantastic Know My Name exhibition at the National Gallery of Australia, celebrating 100 years of Australian women artists. This is an important exhibition as we approach the celebration of International Women's Day on 8 March. On top of their annual Commonwealth funding, the NGA received an almost $22 million capital works package in the 2017-18 budget, along with an additional $14 million in ongoing funding in 2018-19. I'm pleased to say that, in December 2020, they received a further $20 million to upgrade lights and electrical systems, with aging halogen globes to be replaced by LEDs. It's fantastic to see a sustainable future emerging.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example is the National Film and Sound Archive, which has received $5.5 million over four years for the digitisation of at-risk audiovisual material. We all know those wedding videos that we want transformed into something that will be future-proofed are incredibly important for our own personal stories. So, too, it is for our collective stories that are stored at the National Film and Sound Archive. This is in line with the Morrison government's vision for our national collecting institutes to modernise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout COVID-19, these institutes have been supported with $19.5 million to weather the cost of lost revenue typically derived from ticket sales, gift shop sales and the like. During COVID-19, the national collecting institutes reached new audiences through social media and digitally accessible content, including online and virtual tours. It is so important to see creativity pivoting to the ways of having to manage through COVID. This creative rethink is a testament to the vitality of the institutions themselves. I hope to see remote and improved accessibility a legacy of the COVID-19 pandemic—always looking for opportunities and always open to changing the way they do things to be able to engage and deal with the public as it changes, too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill fits neatly with the current inquiry of the Standing Committee on Communications and the Arts into Australia's creative and cultural industries and institutions. I'm proud to be one of those who called for this last year as a member of that committee in response to feedback from my constituents in my electorate of Higgins. Importantly, we're considering the following five issues. The first is the direct and indirect economic benefits and employment opportunities of creative and cultural industries and institutions and how to recognise, measure and grow them. We're also looking at the non-economic benefits that enhance community and social wellbeing and promote Australia's national identity. Who we are as Australians is reflected in our creative and cultural industries and institutions, and it's important to recognise, measure and grow them as well. This is the Australian story as we know it. We're also looking at the best mechanism for ensuring cooperation and delivery of policy between layers of government. So often I've heard how state, federal and even council funding mechanisms are not working together to make sure that they're supporting, in a cooperative way, these very important areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth area of investigation is the impact of COVID-19 on the creative and cultural industries. As we know, there has been a great deal of pressure applied as lockdowns have had an impact on ticket sales. Lastly, we are also looking at avenues for increasing access and opportunities for Australia's creative and cultural industries through innovation and the digital environment. We know the world is transforming digitally and so, too, must our cultural and creative industries and institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, the committee heard that the creative and performing arts sector has been a major beneficiary of JobKeeper through the COVID-19 pandemic. This is contrary to what the members opposite would have you believe. I was actually astounded to hear the level of support from JobKeeper to the performing arts was $560 million across the sector. This was to 25,000 organisations and 122,000 people. That's an extraordinary level of support. We understand that the coverage for all employment of JobKeeper was around 30 per cent, but the approximate coverage of JobKeeper within the creative and performing arts was around 50 to 60 per cent. It was necessary because of the lockdown and because of the public health measures that were taken to keep all of us safe. But I'm glad to hear that JobKeeper was there to support this incredibly important sector as it had to deal with an incredible change to the way it operated in 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government's support for the creative and performing arts before, during and after the COVID pandemic remains unwavering. The Morrison government understands the cultural and creative value of our national collecting institutions, now and long into the future after we have all left this place. I'm proud that we've worked so closely with the philanthropic sector and the governing bodies of these institutions to develop this bill to ensure their long-term financial viability. Giving our national collecting institutions greater autonomy and modernising and streamlining their functions will mean they remain the cornerstone of our cultural society. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    <a href="182468" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  We all know that the Liberal and National parties have a very poor record of supporting the arts and our nation's collecting institutions. Remember the furore that occurred in the 1970s when the Whitlam government purchased Jackson Pollock's artwork <span style="font-style:italic;">Blue Poles</span>? Remember the roar that came from the conservative side of politics and many conservative media commentators about it being a waste of money? Of course, it was one of Australia's best investments in the artistic space. It's a very, very important part of our cultural history, and it's there for all to see in the National Gallery of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The institutions that are subject to this bill, the National Collecting Institutions Legislation Amendment Bill 2020, have seen cuts under the coalition government that stretch back to the 2015 budget, resulting in job losses and a reduction of services. Most recently, the National Gallery of Australia announced 30 to 40 job losses. We all know that this government never really takes the arts seriously. It's been far too slow to respond to the queries from those in the arts industry, particularly their fears about the end of JobKeeper in a few weeks. Whether it's the independent cinemas or local arts organisations, they're facing a tough time when JobKeeper ends.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is important. It makes a number of changes to the governance of six of our national collecting institutions—the Australian National Maritime Museum, the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Library of Australia, the National Museum of Australia and the National Portrait Gallery. The stated aim of this bill is to standardise the operating conditions of these six institutions. The key changes are as follows. For the first time, the governing bodies of the National Library and the National Gallery will be subject to ministerial written direction. The financial thresholds which trigger ministerial approval for the acquisition of works, land and other assets will be removed from the legislation and put into regulation, but we understand that those regulations will be disallowable. The investment mandates of the institutions will be made more flexible. There is a concern about that. Many see the investment-mandate changes as an opportunity for the coalition government to further reduce funding for these important institutions. I don't think it's unreasonable to say that it's probably the wish of the government that these organisations look more at investment as a means of generating income, rather than government support. Specific to the National Gallery, the bill removes the requirement for the national collection to be exclusively housed in the ACT. That's probably a positive development, particularly when we're talking about Indigenous artworks and cultural items. Properly, on the basis of consultation with Indigenous communities, these should be housed and displayed on country so that members of those communities can learn about and understand the significance of those important artworks. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also allows those national collecting institutions to dispose of material without the need for ministerial approval, where an item is valued below a specific threshold. To date, there have been different thresholds across those collecting institutions, and this bill will introduce a consistent threshold of $2 million, except in the case of the National Gallery of Australia, where the threshold will be $10 million. An issue has been raised with this particular element of the bill, and I think it's a reasonable one. It's been raised by First Nations representatives, who submitted to the Senate inquiry that it's very important that, before asset disposal occurs, there is consultation with Indigenous communities and elders about the significance of those assets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In her submission to the Senate inquiry, Elizabeth Pearson commented on the notion of a financial threshold for Indigenous cultural artefacts. She argued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The value of Indigenous cultural heritage to Traditional Owners simply cannot be accurately measured or conveyed through monetary value thresholds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is important that statutory provisions relating to the disposal of NCI artefacts are culturally competent and provide appropriate recognition of and consultation with First Nations Peoples in considering disposing of items of Indigenous cultural heritage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Pearson also argued that the bill should contain provisions that require the national collecting institutions to consult with First Nations peoples when an NCI proposes to dispose of an Indigenous object in its collection. It's a point that I agree with and that Labor agrees with. There must be consultation with elders and with Indigenous community groups prior to the disposal of important cultural artefacts. I note that, in the evidence that he gave to the Senate inquiry, Mat Trinca from the National Museum said that the museum does have in place policies and procedures that are to be followed in instances of disposal of important cultural artefacts such as those. I would hope that all of these institutions would take a similar approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must say, in respect of the National Museum and certain displays and exhibitions they have had, that there has been in the past a tradition of consultation with First Nations elders and communities. There's an exhibition in the museum at the moment about Captain Cook's <span style="font-style:italic;">Endeavour</span> voyage. The exhibition is called <span style="font-style:italic;">Endeavour Voyage: The Untold Stories of Cook and the First Australians</span>. The exhibition charts Cook's 126 days up the east coast of Australia when he arrived here, and the particular significance of this exhibition is the consultation that has occurred with First Nations people and its view of the Cook expedition from the shore. In much of history and much that's taught to Australians, the view is always from the journals of Cook and his expedition, with very little of the view from the shore. That's why this is an important exhibition. I know there was consultation with the La Perouse Local Aboriginal Land Council, in the area I represent, and elders and representatives of that community in putting this exhibition together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is important to recognise that when Cook set foot on Kurnell in 1770 at Kamay, or Botany Bay as it's now known, to claim the east coast of Australia in the name of King George, it began the process of First Australians being dispossessed of their land, robbed of their culture and cut off from their language. When Cook's expedition left our shore, it took with it the sovereignty of the First Australians over the land they had nurtured and inhabited for tens of thousands of years. It also took many spears, shields and other cultural items and pieces that tell an important story about our nation's true history. These are deeply cherished and significant cultural relics that connect today's First Australians with their ancestors and traditions. Yet in 2021 these items are still predominantly housed in displays in museums throughout Europe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's my view and the view of many on the Labor side and indeed the view of many First Nations peoples that those cultural artefacts belong on country. They belong with the descendants of those who created them. They belong in Australia. A major symbol of this dispossession is an artefact known as the Gweagal shield and a series of spears that are actually on display at the moment in the Australian Museum as part of this Cook expedition. When that expedition left our shores, those items were stolen and taken from the Gweagal people who inhabited the shores of Botany Bay. The shield and those spears, which are on loan at the moment to the National Museum, are housed in British museums in a collection of some 6,000 Australian items, many of them questionably acquired. Most of them aren't even on display, and those that are on display are down the back and are not prominently displayed, particularly those in the British Museum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The museum has refused repeated requests from descendants of the Kamay men and women for the return of these artefacts. There are a few cases where the requests have been agreed for other artefacts, but the practice is the exception. In 2015 the British Museum loaned the Gweagal shield and other artefacts to the National Museum of Australia for its <span style="font-style:italic;">Encounters</span> exhibition but only after the federal government—the Labor government at the time—passed legislation, the Protection of Cultural Objects on Loan Act, rendering these items that were loaned back to Australia legally immune from Indigenous claims. I know that that was necessary to ensure that the British Museum would loan those artefacts to Australia for display here, but it shouldn't have had to happen. It simply should not have had to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are very, very important artefacts that tell the truth about Australian history, and, as a gesture of truth telling, as a gesture of recognition and as a gesture of reconciliation, these artefacts should be returned to their original owners, the First Nations peoples whose ancestors created them. These artefacts should be returned to country so that the descendants of those from whom they were taken can learn about their history and their culture and pass on this important heritage to their children—not only Indigenous children but other Australian children as well, so that we may learn more about the significance to Australia of history pre Cook. That may help us—and I believe it certainly will help us—to overcome this barrier that has existed in Australia, particularly on the conservative side of politics, to amending our constitution to finally recognise the First Australians and listening to what they have had to say to us for the past decade about what they would like to see and how they would like to see government work with First Nations communities through a constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we can have these cultural artefacts returned and learn from First Nations people and their ancestors, to whom these remains and artefacts are important, maybe we can overcome some of the barrier that has existed not only on the conservative side of politics but in this parliament more generally and overcome the inability to put up a referendum and ask the Australian people whether or not they believe it's important that a voice to parliament is enshrined in our constitution and that we finally recognise that truth telling is important. There is precedent for this, and I ask the British government to take note that, this week, 2,000 Indigenous stone artefacts have been repatriated to Australia by the Israeli Museum with the support of the Israeli government. I thank the Israeli government for doing that. It's an important gesture and it will be important to truth telling in our nation. It proves to the British government and the British Museum that we can do the same, and that they should do the same and work with the Australian government and bodies like AIATSIS, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, who have been specifically mandated and allocated a budget to work with other foreign governments, organisations and museums to negotiate the return of these cultural artefacts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is important because it highlights the fact that our national collecting institutions are important in telling the stories of Australia and, most importantly, in telling the stories of the First Nations people. These institutions have a role to play in returning artefacts such as those I've mentioned so that those stories can be told.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  I rise to make a brief contribution on the National Collecting Institutions Legislation Amendment Bill 2020. It's a great pleasure to talk about our national collecting institutions. To digress slightly: when I think of our national institutions, I am reminded of how lucky we are to have this purpose-built national capital city, Canberra. The great thing about our national collecting institutions is that they are situated in such a beautifully designed city. I think it's appropriate to acknowledge Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin, the co-designers of this city. On the eve of International Women's Day, it's one of the great wrongs that Marion Mahony Griffin is not equally credited with her contribution to designing the city of Canberra alongside her husband. They were genuinely a team, and I think we need to do a better job of making that point going forward. I know that some corrections of historical records have been occurring, but I still think that we could do much more in that regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I actually spent a few years growing up in Canberra, and it was a great pleasure as a young child to have all the natural and built-form attributes of this capital city at that point in my childhood. At the time of Federation, of course, there was a debate between the two great cities of this continent, as they would describe themselves—Sydney and Melbourne—about where the capital might be. I think it was a very sensible compromise of the founders of the federation of Australia to determine that we should build a new city to be our capital. When we're talking about our great collecting institutions, I don't think they would be the same if they were crammed into the existing footprints of Melbourne or Sydney. I can't imagine where a national library would've been built or a national gallery would've been built. We are so blessed to have this great 'Rome of the South' that is Canberra thanks to the way it's been planned and designed, with the opportunities for those institutions to grow, spread their wings and achieve their full potential on the dedicated footprint that the Griffin husband and wife team designed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That, of course, means that we have this beautiful Parliamentary Triangle and we have a city that was designed and intended to have these great institutions. There are the collecting institutions, of course. There are other ones, like this very beautiful building we're in right now and the other major institutions of a modern nation. Nonetheless, the collecting institutions are a part of that, and this legislation is very important for giving them the opportunity to continue to seek out support from beyond the taxpayer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Philanthropy is something I think we could do a much better job of encouraging in this country. There are some great philanthropists who make spectacular contributions across a wide range of areas. The member for Higgins talked about her own history and experiences when it comes to people philanthropically supporting medical research in this country. I think we have a reasonably good culture of that. We probably don't have as good a culture as some nations when it comes to other institutions, particularly those that people might instinctively feel should be funded by the taxpayer. That's one of the challenges with institutions like our galleries, the library et cetera: there's probably an assumption that supporting them is not necessary, because the taxpayer provides them support, and that should be enough. Of course we proudly provide taxpayer support to these institutions, but it would be great, obviously, to encourage more private citizens with the capacity to add to that taxpayer contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So one element of this bill is to give these institutions a better ability to explain to potential philanthropists that they will achieve maximum value from the contributions that might be potentially made to them. Clearly, when the boards of these collecting institutions are given more latitude around how they will be investing funds they might receive—which, of course, is relevant to the person making the donation; they want to see the money that they contribute achieve maximum value for the institution—if there is a decision between these institutions being contributed to versus others, an issue for the philanthropist or potential philanthropist is worry that the conservatism of the way their funds will be invested is going to mean the money they give is not going to go as far as it might by donating to another institution that doesn't have those restrictions. So, it seems completely logical that we remove that factor in the decision-making process. People will make a decision to contribute to our national collecting institutions purely on the strength that that's where they see the maximum value for the money they are wanting to contribute being achieved, not because they've got these concerns in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a largely administrative correction. It's nice to have the other harmonies created across the institutions. I think that's very sensible. They've all got a common purpose. They perform different functions from a collections point of view, but there's no logical reason why their governance structure need be different. So the harmonisation there is sensible. Restricting the length of service for board directors et cetera is, frankly, just bringing them into line with the way in which best practice occurs with any board across this country and around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The adoption of this bill will be good for these collecting institutions. It is a good demonstration from this government that we want to encourage philanthropy in this country not only in the other very worthy places where people choose to donate their funds; we also put a focus on seeking philanthropic support for our institutions that, yes, receive government support and are taxpayer funded but could do so much more if they are equally able to supplement that support with further financial support from private citizens in this country. I therefore commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a>  On the issue of wisdom, George Orwell once said, 'Those who control the present can control the past, and if you control the past you can control the future.' Our national collecting institutions are an incredibly important part of the institutional framework that Australia and any liberal democracy has, to ensure we know what happened in our past and that that is left not to the interpretation of ideologues but to the interpretation of the original documents which formed that part of our nation's history. This is critical, because, as Orwell pointed out, without that basis of truth you cannot find wisdom. Fifty-year-olds in this place cannot be wise unless they can access original documents that provide the truth to that wisdom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is important because it further instils in our nation the critical elements of ensuring that our national collecting agencies allow for and provide for the collection of original documents that future generations can base decisions on. It was a wise man—Genghis Khan, I believe—who once said: 'We here will make enough mistakes on our own. We should ensure that they are different mistakes. We should learn from the mistakes that our elders made so that we have the opportunity to make new ones that we can pass on to future generations in order to make this planet a better place.' It is important that we ensure that our national collecting agencies do have all the resources and the buy-in from the Australian public to ensure that these documents are maintained and that they are critically available to as many people as possible, especially future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation modernises the arrangements for six national collecting institutions in the arts portfolio, and I would urge the government to look at other institutions outside the arts portfolio that could benefit from similar modernisation. The six that we're looking at today are the Australian National Maritime Museum, the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Library of Australia, the National Museum of Australia, and the National Portrait Gallery of Australia. These institutions are all critical to the future of our nation and the future of policy development in this nation. This bill that is before the parliament today did not come out of thin air. It did not sprout forth, as Nyx did, from the unavoidable void. It comes from consultation with these very same institutions. We have responded to their concerns raised over a long period of time. This government is acting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The national collecting institutions are the caretakers of our shared stories. In a world where there is so much division, where there are so many people trying to pull us apart, it is important that we have institutions that remind us that our history is shared, that our purpose is common, that our goals and our visions move in the right direction—that is, the empowerment of the individual—to ensure this nation is left better by this generation for the next than it was when passed to us by previous generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill enables the institutions, for the first time, to invest donated funds in a range of investment options that attract a higher rate of return and which are not currently permitted under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013. Who knew that government regulation could get in the way of good governance? But, as amazing as it may appear to this chamber, it has occurred once again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Sturt referred to Canberra as the 'Rome of the South'. Never have truer words been spoken in this chamber. Indeed, our greatness, the greatness of this city, is not in the treasures it possesses but in the wealth that it shares, and these collecting institutions are the collectors of great wealths of knowledge that need to be shared with so many of our people. From major philanthropic gifting through to individual contributions, financial donations enable audiences and patrons to express concrete support for our cultural institutions, but, more importantly, their appreciation—individual Australians showing their appreciation—for the work that these institutions do and the contributions they make to our nation. It does that by ensuring the value for donated money is optimised. National collecting institutions are able to honour private benefactors and build foundations to nurture ongoing partnerships and encourage new ones with the philanthropic sector. I would just make this important point: it is not just in the receipt of the money; it is in the partnership, it is in the skills, the knowledge and the connections that philanthropists bring to a partnership that we can further improve and advance the work of these collecting agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As noted by the institutions themselves, donors have expressed concern at the constraints to usefully investing their money to deliver returns. Indeed, one institution noted that donors have been horrified when they've realised how little could be earned for their money. This bill will put the national collecting institutions on a level playing field with other sectors, enabling them to attract greater support in the highly competitive realm of philanthropic giving, and recognises the role donors already play in investing in these institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill establishes provisions to ensure transparency in risk management through processes that include the development and publication of an institution's investment policy. The bill is not about diminishing the level of government support for these institutions; it is about enhancing that support. It is about allowing these institutions to become more agile and more nimble. In 2021 alone, the government is providing them collectively with over $250 million to enable all Australians to engage with and understand these institutions' diverse and significant collections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also improve administrative consistency across the enabling legislation of each of these institutions. It will improve efficiency; align governance obligations with the more recent Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act; and, rightly, vest responsibility for day-to-day and collection related transactions to senior management of these institutions and their governing boards and councils as accountable authorities. This would include removing the requirement for agencies to seek the minister's approval prior to entering into arrangements for the supply of utilities, security and cleaning services. I note that the institutions themselves have unanimously welcomed the proposed changes to their investment powers and to other administrative arrangements, and I thank them for their contribution to the development of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are truly to rise to Rome during its great majesty, this is our time to do so. This chamber can make that happen. I commend this bill to the chamber.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282982" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MARTIN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  I value and have enormous time for Australian museums, and the people of Reid love our museums also, so today I stand in support of the National Collecting Institutions Legislation Amendment Bill 2020. Australia's national collecting institutions play an incredibly important role in preserving, promoting and shaping Australia's intellectual and cultural landscape. Museums and galleries are places that allow our nation's history and culture to be accessible to everyone. Whether through history, culture or art, these institutions preserve and cultivate the soul of our nation. I love taking my children to our national museums during school holidays to immerse them in Australian history and culture. These visits are always interesting for them and often stimulate incredible conversation while we're there and also on the way home. So, museums have an important place and play an important role for our future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether it be through Indigenous Australian or through international collections, museums provide a forum for new perspectives and world views to be shared and to shape the conversation about our nation's future. As a parliamentarian I have of course spent a great deal of my year down in Canberra, and here we're fortunate to be surrounded by a number of incredible museums and exhibitions. One of my favourite memories from this time last year was getting to visit the National Gallery of Australia during a sitting week, after parliament had risen, to enjoy the Picasso exhibition. While it is wonderful to see the work of such renowned artists, it was the most beautiful portraits by Australian painter Hugh Ramsay that really transfixed my attention. While I came for an international exhibit, it was Indigenous and Australian art collections that delayed my departure by several hours. These collections and exhibitions challenge and inspire Australians and international visitors alike. They share our talent and tell our stories—and they are powerful, powerful stories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Gallery of Australia is home to the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Indigenous Art Triennial</span>, Australia's first large-scale re-occurring exhibition dedicated to contemporary Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art and artists. Our Indigenous Australians have one of the oldest living traditions of art in the world, and we all have the privilege of being able to learn and understand this culture through the art displayed in these spaces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the National Gallery of Australia is holding an exhibition titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Know My Name: Australian Women Artists 1900 to Now</span>. Drawn from the National Gallery's collection as well as loans from across Australia, it is the most comprehensive display of art by women that has ever been assembled in this country. It not only places the focus on Australian female talent in the arts but also plays an important role in offering alternative histories, challenging stereotypes and sharing the stories of all women artists. The National Gallery is just one example of how Australia's national collecting institutions shape meaning and culture in our country. They preserve our history but also offer powerful perspectives and diverse world views that shape our understanding of the past and the future. Many donors, patrons and supporters play a significant part in investing in these institutions, and it is important—particularly as we bounce back from the COVID-19 recession—that these institutions have greater freedom in how they invest funds raised from donations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what the National Collecting Institutions Legislation Amendment Bill sets out to do. The bill reforms and modernises legislative arrangements for six iconic national collecting institutions in the arts portfolio: the Australian National Maritime Museum, the National Film and Sound Archive, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Library of Australia, the National Museum of Australia and the National Portrait Gallery. The bill was developed in consultation with these institutions and responds to concerns that they have raised over a period of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill enables them, for the first time, to direct donated funds in a range of investment options that attract a higher rate of return and which are not currently permitted under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act. By ensuring that value for donated money is enhanced, national collecting institutions are able to honour private benefaction and build foundations to nurture ongoing partnerships and encourage new ones with the philanthropic sector. These institutions have noted that their donors are concerned about the current constraints that limit the way donations are invested, with little opportunity to deliver returns. One institution noted that donors had been horrified when they realised how little could be earned from their money. This bill will put the national collecting institutions on a level playing field with other sectors. These new reforms will enable them to attract greater support in the highly competitive realm of philanthropic giving, and they recognise the role that donors already play in investing in these institutions. The bill establishes provisions to ensure transparency and risk management, through processes that include the development and publication of an institution's investments policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From major philanthropic gifts through to individual contributions, donations enable audiences and patrons to express support for our cultural institutions. However, we know that these institutions cannot rely on donations alone. These institutions add significant economic, social and intellectual value to our nation, and it is important that we invest in them. Government support is necessary to ensure that these institutions thrive, and this bill in no way diminishes the level of support being delivered to these institutions. In the last year alone, the government has provided these institutions with over $250 million, collectively, to enable all Australians to engage with and understand the diverse and significant collections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also improve administrative consistency across the enabling legislation of each of the institutions. It will enhance efficiency; align governance obligations with the recent Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act; and rightfully place responsibility for day-to-day collection related transactions with senior management of these institutions and their governing boards and councils as accountable authorities. This would include removing the requirement for agencies to seek the minister's approval prior to entering into arrangements for the supply of utilities, security and cleaning services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The institutions themselves have unanimously welcomed the proposed changes both to their investment powers and to other administrative arrangements. It was through their contribution that this bill was developed, and I am confident that these reforms will strengthen our national collecting institutions. I recommend that the House pass this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  The bill before the House, the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Supporting Economic Recovery) Bill 2020, is urgent and necessary because the Gillard government's responsible lending provisions quite simply are now throttling businesses in this country. The intent behind these provisions in the wake of the global financial crisis were good. We must always ensure that lenders are careful not to give loans to people or businesses who manifestly cannot pay them back. However, in the context of the financial services royal commission and the rightly powerful enforcement messages coming from Australian regulators, the responsible lending provisions have become a millstone around the neck of this country. $34 billion a month in credit sits under these regulations. In a post-COVID world, we will need that credit to flow quickly and efficiently. As sound businesses in the worst affected sectors around the country continue to struggle and whilst unemployment remains elevated, we must drive growth and investment with a finance system that can adapt to changing circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finance brokers in Fisher have described to me how the Gillard government's responsible lending laws took a noble concept and turned it into a bureaucratic nightmare. The Institute of Public Affairs have gone further. They've described responsible lending laws as:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… a disaster—drying up credit long before COVID-19 hit, and especially when credit is most needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In creating regulation to protect customers, we must ensure that the rules remain flexible enough to adapt to worsening circumstances and serve customers in harder times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be fair to the Gillard government, the responsible lending regime was not intended to be as onerous as it has become. Nor was it intended to apply to small business loans. However, in the strict regulatory environment that has understandably followed the financial services royal commission, the reality has become very different. Regulators and loan providers alike have become substantially overcautious, introducing requirements that go far beyond the basic legislative tests and spreading responsible lending practices to all kinds of credit. ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott, giving evidence to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, summed it up:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The only rational response … is to stay away from the line. So you just stay away from the line; you build a buffer … we have become more and more cautious.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This response is all the more understandable in the context of the conflicting advice that can be provided around this issue by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, or ASIC, and the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, or APRA. While ASIC, for example, states that lenders do not need to conduct a full responsible lending assessment for individuals converting from a principal-and-interest loan to an interest-only loan, APRA requires a comprehensive review. According to Mr Elliot's evidence, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority takes its own third approach to responsible lending. Even Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe agreed that this system needs to be revised. As he said during the aforementioned inquiry: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I think the principles in the legislation are sound, but I think the way we've translated those principles into reality needs looking at again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On a portfolio basis, we want banks to make some loans that actually go bad, because if a bank never makes a loan that goes bad it means it's not extending enough credit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need legislative clarity to replace the increasingly complex guidance provided by regulators and to get the flow of credit moving again. I cannot stress how important this is for Australian businesses today. Of particular concern are the extreme practices which have been introduced by ASIC's guidance on lending obligations to verify the information that they are provided with. ASIC has introduced some 90 pages of guidance with detailed processes which go far beyond the original intention of this legislation and, in effect, force many lenders to examine every line on customers' bank statements. Finance brokers have come to me in absolute despair, as have people who have applied for home loans, telling me that the banks have been reviewing how much they are spending at a coffee shop each month and how much they're spending at Domino's or a pizza shop each month.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Applications for finance can now take eight weeks to assess, with more than half of that time spent trawling through existing expenses which tell us little or nothing about an individual's capacity to pay. Anyone who has ever taken out a mortgage knows that your lifestyle when you have the debt is very different to what you have experienced before. Justice Perram of the Federal Court expressed this truth very colourfully:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I may eat Wagyu beef every day washed down with the finest Shiraz but, if I really want my new home, I can make do on much more modest fare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">Without additional information, I do not consider that it is possible to accept that the consumer's declared living expenses tell one anything about their capacity to meet repayments under the loan.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet it is exactly this kind of detail which currently makes the difference between whether or not a hardworking family can get a loan, and it can even impact the flow of much-needed credit to a local small business. In the process, given the number of new loans issued each year, this approach is undoubtedly adding tens of millions of dollars to the cost of getting finance at a time when it has never been more needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Madam Deputy Speaker, I invite you and anybody else listening to this to think for a moment what happens to Australian businesses and Australians when they can't get finance—they can't buy a car, they can't buy a house, they can't buy earthmoving equipment and they can't buy that new piece of equipment for their business that might drive innovation. That's what happens when we overcomplicate this system. The bill before the House will cut that cost and get credit moving again, by removing the existing inflexible responsible-lending obligations from those larger lenders offering home and business loans that are in many cases already being regulated by APRA. In the case of non-bank lenders who are not, the bill will give the minister powers to determine new lending standards that will align with APRA's requirements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the new standards, lenders large and small will still be required to maintain strong consumer protections, to run appropriate credit assessments and to examine their customers' capacity to pay. However, the bill will allow lenders to apply flexible processes that are appropriate to the borrower and the type of product offered. It will also allow them to rely on the information provided by consumers, unless there are reasonable grounds for believing it to be unreliable. This will remove the sword hanging over the heads of those who write loans and will streamline the approvals process to deliver faster and fairer outcomes for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While freeing up the flow of credit and ensuring that lenders can support our economic recovery, the bill also strengthens the protections available to vulnerable consumers. Small-amount credit contracts, also called payday loans, are disproportionately taken out by low-income Australians. These individuals are at particular risk from unscrupulous lending practices and from the spirals of debt and fees that can too often result from their use. The bill before the House protects these consumers by prohibiting small-amount credit contract providers from charging monthly fees after a small-amount credit contract is discharged. It also requires that these payday loans have equal repayments and equal repayment intervals so that repayments are clear, predictable and upfront and do not increase unexpectedly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the bill directly protects those most vulnerable Australians by prohibiting small-amount credit contract and consumer lease providers from providing credit to individuals who receive significant proportions of their income from Centrelink where the resulting repayments would consume a large amount of that income. Credit providers would be prohibited from writing any payday loans or consumer leases that require a person who gets 50 per cent or more of their income from Centrelink to allocate more than 20 per cent of that income to those repayments. In the case of individuals who receive less than 50 per cent of their income from Centrelink, there would be separate caps of 20 per cent for each of small-amount credit contracts and consumer leases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In an ideal world these risky high-interest products would not be necessary. The tactics used to promote them should be carefully controlled. This bill thus helps protect vulnerable consumers from experiencing pressure to take out a payday loan, by prohibiting unsolicited invitations to current and former customers as well as door-to-door selling of consumer leases. These protections have another important aspect that I want to touch on briefly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures to increase consumer safety around payday loans will be important in the context of the use of credit in gambling. Study after study tells us that gambling leads to increased cost-of-living pressures on hardworking families, increases crime, antisocial behaviour and family and domestic violence, and drives up drug and alcohol abuse. It is clearly harmful enough that the growth of online gambling today allows vulnerable Australians to wager and lose everything they own, anywhere, anytime, with just a few taps on a phone. What is worse is that, today, credit cards can be used to gamble online, leaving vulnerable problem gamblers with huge debts that they cannot afford to pay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said, I believe we need to close this loophole; however, it is not the only way that credit can be used to facilitate gambling. Payday loans provide a destructive fallback option for problem gamblers who bet and lose more than can afford ahead of their next pay cheque. The use of these loans can, if unchecked, effectively facilitating gambling harms through short-term credit. The welcome provisions in this bill, extending the responsible lending requirements for these loans and introducing new regulations to limit the proportion of income that those receiving income from Centrelink can spend on credit contracts, will help to minimise the likelihood of these gambling fuelled debt spirals in the future. However, in the case of traditional lower interest credit products, where bank staff are expected to run through an individual's account, line by line, to check whether they have a Netflix account and how much they spend on pizza, we have a problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is frustrating enough when responsible Australians in good credit cannot get finance for a sofa, a mobile phone, a car, equipment or a house, but the current situation is much more serious than that. Hardworking Australians with no record of defaulting on credit are in some cases unable to get a mortgage to buy a home. Successful construction businesses in my electorate of Fisher cannot get a loan to buy much-needed equipment which will help them grow their business. In those sorts of circumstances, the current regulations, if left unamended, are a handbrake on our economy, on our businesses and on innovation. In an environment where we are all, collectively, trying to assist Australians and Australian businesses, giving them a leg-up so that we can claw our way out of this pandemic, we need to do everything we possibly can in this place to facilitate that economic growth. This bill will do just that, and I commend it to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHALMERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:22</span>):  I rise to speak on the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Supporting Economic Recovery) Bill 2020. The primary purpose of this bill, as we now know from the earlier speakers, is to unwind the responsible lending obligations which apply to most consumer credit contracts. The reason that we are opposed to this is that it is an attempt to unwind or ignore the very first recommendation of the Hayne royal commission: that the responsible lending obligations shouldn't be amended. It beggars belief in lots of ways that those opposite, who opposed the royal commission for two years, voting against it 26 times, and dragged their feet on implementing the recommendations—only a third of them have been implemented and are in force, two years after the report was received—are now in here arguing that the government should be allowed to contradict the very first recommendations, on responsible lending laws, which act as consumer protections in the banking system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our view is that the government should not be using the pandemic or the recession and its aftermath as an excuse to do what they always want to do, which is to unwind important consumer protections in the financial system. It's like they weren't paying attention to the Hayne royal commission and the rorts and rip-offs that it uncovered. Those opposite get given a big report about all the rorts and rip-offs in the banking system, and their first inclination is: 'How can we unwind these protections, which the royal commission advised in its first recommendation that we should keep?' That is ridiculous. It really is next level to use this pandemic as an excuse to go after consumers. We won't be supporting that effort. We won't be supporting it for a range of reasons that I'm happy to take the House through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that major change, the bill contains a number of other changes to the law relating to small amount credit contracts, or SACCs, and consumer leases. It sets a cap on payments for small amount credit contracts and leases: 20 per cent of a consumer's income, or 10 per cent if it's another arrangement. It sets a maximum cost of four per cent per month for consumer leases, requires that payments be equally spread and prohibits providers from charging monthly fees on the residual term if it is paid off early. Others have gone through the detail of the bill as it relates to those small amount credit contracts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we need to remember that this is primarily about unwinding those responsible lending laws. The responsible lending laws were introduced in 2009—as you may recall, Deputy Speaker—by the Rudd Labor government. They introduced the National Consumer Credit Protection Act, which put in place a range of directives around the conduct of credit providers, including requiring them to abide by a set of responsible lending obligations. What those obligations require is that credit providers make reasonable inquiries about a customer and assess whether a credit product will be unsuitable for a customer. In other words, these responsible lending laws are about making sure that people don't get in over their head, that people aren't caught signing up to loans that they can't repay, with all of the damage that that might do to their financial situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a big issue here, a big set of facts. If the government doesn't want to take our word for it that this is not necessary and not wise and not well motivated, just consider what's actually happening to credit access in this economy. We are all for the free flow of finance. We understand how crucial that is to this recovery from the recession, obviously. We want people to be able to access funds and access loans and borrow and pay for homes and pay for cars and all of that sort of thing. We want that to work as efficiently as possible. Those opposite—including the speaker before me, unfortunately—were going on about how there'd been some kind of choking of credit, that the laws are responsible for that, and that's why we need to change it. But, respectfully to that member, that is complete and utter rubbish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a solution looking for a problem. If you listen to Kevin Davis from the University of Melbourne, he says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it is difficult to discern evidence in public statistics that responsible lending obligations have adversely affected loan growth or the cost of household-sector borrowing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's just absolute rubbish to suggest that we need to remove these consumer protections because there's been this chokehold on lending. The facts tell a very different story. Just look at the recent ABS data, the lending indicators for December 2020—they were released earlier this month—showing the total value of new loan commitments for new housing and the value of owner-occupied home loan commitments each reached record highs in December 2020—record highs! Yet still those characters over there will jump up, one after another, and say, 'We've got a big problem here: we're not getting enough loan commitments.' We had record highs in December 2020, the highest ever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another stat: the total value of new loan commitments for housing rose 8.6 per cent to $26 billion in 2020. That's a 31.2 per cent increase on December in the year before. It is laughable that they're pretending that there's been a choking off of credit because of these responsible lending laws. The responsible lending laws are about making sure that lending is appropriate, that people don't get in over their heads. They say there's been a choking off, but the facts show it's at record levels. Lending is at record levels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A third and final fact is that the number of owner-occupied first home buyer loan commitments rose 9.3 per cent to reach 15,205. That's a 56.6 per increase cent since December 2019. This is the highest level since June 2009.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of those facts absolutely torpedo the central premise of those opposite arguing for the removal of consumer protections. If it's not about removing obstacles to lending, which is at record highs, we know what it's really about: it's about unwinding consumer protections. They've never seen consumer protections that they haven't wanted to junk. They always side with the big banks against the interests of ordinary working people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Australia are doing what they can to work hard and get ahead. They're trying to borrow responsibly. You can see from that data that people are doing their best to sign up for loans and to service those loans. That lending is at record highs. Those opposite say, 'The problem we want to address here is there's not enough lending,' when lending is at record highs, and that exposes the complete and utter farcical rubbish at the core of what those opposite are trying to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Treasury's own submission to the banking royal commission said that appropriate responsible lending laws could enhance rather than detract from macroeconomic outcomes. Those opposite want to get up—and no doubt the next speaker will—and say, 'We've got a big problem here, and it's holding back the economy,' and all the rest of it, but we would save a lot of time if they just got up and said: 'We want to unwind protections for people in the banking system. We want to ignore recommendation 1 of the Hayne royal commission. We never wanted the royal commission in the first place. We want to junk it as soon as possible. We're using the pandemic as an excuse to do that.' That's what is really happening here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said it before, and I say it again: if there are legitimate issues that need to be addressed here, then let's have a conversation about that. If there are legitimate issues that need to be addressed, let's refine the system, let's speak with the financial institutions, as I do, let's speak to the consumer groups, as I do—if there's a legitimate problem here. But there's nothing in the data, nothing in the expert independent academic opinion, nothing in the Treasury's submission to the royal commission in the first place that suggest these responsible lending laws are anything other than important. They're certainly not holding back lending when you look at those astronomical numbers that I just quoted. They should stop using this pandemic as an excuse to unwind important consumer protections that are adding to the robustness of our financial system, rather than detracting from it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, again, you don't want to believe the data, you don't want to believe the Treasury, you don't want to believe the University of Melbourne academic and you don't want to believe us. But, a decade after these laws were put in place, laws introduced by Labor in 2009, there was a survey of financial counsellors, and what they found was that 97 per cent of financial counsellors said that responsible lending laws should remain in place. Ninety-three per cent of them had used responsible lending laws to advocate for their clients. These guys are doing really important work looking after people in the financial system. They want those protections to stay in place, and so do we.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even with these responsible lending laws in place, we've still seen some heartbreaking examples of irresponsible and predatory practices in the banking and financial services industry. Think about Financial Counselling Australia's survey of their members. Just think about it. The Financial Counselling Australia survey asked counsellors, 'What's the worst example of irresponsible lending that you've seen?' In my home state of Queensland, which is the home state of the minister at the table, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, an elderly man with mental health issues who was on the DSP was given three loans within a very short period because he'd been a good client. He was in severe financial distress over a long period. He was too embarrassed to see anyone as he felt ashamed of it. He said he walked past the front door of a financial counsellor six times before he could even go in. The FCA wants to leave these laws in place for people like that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a second case study a company gave an elderly man who was close to retirement a $60,000 car loan. After owning the car for a year he was forced into retirement because of poor health. He moved onto the aged pension and couldn't pay the car loan. The company made no inquiries regarding his ability to pay, and should have identified that the man was close to retirement age.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, these are not isolated cases; they're not one-offs. We saw from the Hayne royal commission that, even with these laws in place, there are still practices which are indefensible, there are still practices where people are encouraged to get in over their heads. We should be looking for ways to support them, not looking for ways to leave those people on their own, to leave them in the lurch and to leave them behind, as those opposite would do if and when this bill is passed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What makes this bill even more galling is that, four years after the government announced they'd do a review into payday loans and rent-to-buy schemes, they've barely lifted a finger to clamp down on loan sharks and payday lending, despite repeated promises to support the 24 recommendations of the review. Here I want to commend my colleague the member for Oxley for his tireless and powerful advocacy in this area. Payday loans are almost exclusively used by people on low incomes in communities like his and communities like mine, next door. People who are trying to keep their heads above water are often preyed upon by these companies, who trap them in horrific debt cycles as a result of outrageous fees and interest rates which are hard to believe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even before the pandemic, the Consumer Law Action Centre said over 4.7 million payday loans worth an approximate total of $3.09 billion were written between April 2016 and July 2019, which represents around 1.77 million Australian households. Too many of those people end up in a debt spiral. A 2018 report examining financial literacy in my part of the world, where I grew up, where I live and where I represent now, Logan City, found there were 43 banks and credit union shopfronts and 45 high-cost credit businesses clustered in suburbs with low socioeconomic indexes like Woodridge and Logan Central, where my electorate office is. Obviously a lot of those businesses are targeting people who cannot afford to repay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's reprehensible that those opposite want to rewind responsible lending protections for consumers. They don't want to do anything meaningful on payday lenders and loan sharks, and that has diabolical consequences for the people I represent, the people the member for Oxley represents and people represented by so many members of the House. This is a solution looking for a problem. It's badly motivated, it's not supported by the data and it's not supported by expert opinion. Instead, as I've said again and again because I believe it, this is nothing more than an opportunistic attempt to use the pandemic to come after people and to unwind the protections which are necessary to make sure that people don't get in over their head.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're on the side of people who want to work hard and take loans they can afford to repay to provide for their loved ones and put a roof over their head and all the rest of it. We are on the side of those people. Those opposite are on the side of the loan sharks and the payday lenders. They want to make it easier for the financial institutions of this country to do more of the kind of rorts and rip-offs the Hayne royal commission uncovered. They want to deliberately ignore, if not contradict, the Hayne royal commission recommendations with this legislation. We will continue to fight for the interests of ordinary working people in the banking system who deserve better. We want the banking system to be strong and profitable, but we also want it to be fair.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  It's a great privilege to speak on the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Supporting Economic Recovery) Bill 2020, focusing on Australia's restricting lending legislation and why we need to drive reform to enable Australians to go to a bank and get money. That's ultimately what this legislation is actually about: enabling Australians to access credit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Restrictive lending laws that deliberately seek to deny or limit people being able to access credit don't hurt the top end of town. Truthfully, it actually favours them, because they just get to sit there in their cushy jobs, guaranteed there is no real risk, and take the cream off the top. It doesn't hurt the rich, either. It's not as if they've got a problem with access to credit most of the time, because they've got the assets to back it up, to have security, so that they can borrow the cash and get access to money. They're a safe bet. The restrictive lending legislation harms the poor. It harms the people on low incomes. It harms small businesses that want to grow. It harms people who don't have security. We all understand there's got to be proportionate risk around security as part of the process of lending, but these laws needlessly make it harder and create extra hurdles and barriers to the young, to those on low incomes, to those who want to get ahead and take risks so they might have their opportunity too. Is it really a shock that since we have introduced restrictive lending laws we've seen a massive growth in demand and credit from non-bank lenders? Is it really a shock that it's become harder and harder for people who live off their salaries and who don't have assets to access credit? Frankly, these laws are farcical in their operation today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give you an example. I'm going to use a personal one. The other day I went to get an increase on my credit card limit. It was, politely, two-fifths of nothing, and I had to fill out 30 pages and wait three weeks. I'm fine. I can handle it. It's more annoying than anything else. But, for some people who need access to credit, secured or unsecured, to support their circumstances straightaway, it can be the difference between whether they can provide finance for their business or not. It can be the difference between whether they're able to purchase a property or not or a home or not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And so it's absurdity we hear from the shadow Treasurer and others railing against it because they're the so-called champions of the poor; they're the ones trying to keep the poor in their place. We are trying to lift them up and give them opportunities to stand on their own two feet, because that's the essence of what liberalism is about—empowering individuals, families and communities. That's the foundation for the success of our country. It's not about trying to keep people in their place to maintain our political relevance, as those on the opposition benches do. The poor are the ones who are hurt most by the current legislation, and that's why reform is so essential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the scary thing is it isn't always just the poor; sometimes even the asset-rich are hit by restrictive lending laws. A number of self-managed superannuation fund holders who are out of the formal workforce and get income through dividends off their assets now can't go to the bank to borrow money. It's just absurd. That's people with millions of dollars in assets and rivers of revenue through dividends as the basis of their income and they can't go to a bank and borrow money. Whether it's for themselves to purchase another asset or whether it's to help their children to buy their first home—whatever it is—restrictive lending means they can't get cash. And for what? It's for the vanity of the opposition because they introduced a Northern American solution to a Northern American problem after the global financial crisis and won't accept they actually just got it wrong. Their legislation doesn't help Australia. It isn't solving an Australian problem. They have created a problem out of nothing to the detriment of everyone except for those with high incomes and large assets who are still in the workforce. It creates needless piles of regulation and processing and capital going towards creating jobs for regulatory compliance for nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the truth is it's not just for nothing. That's because the people being hurt by it are those people who want to get ahead. It's harder and harder for first home buyers to get a loan. It's harder for women who have found themselves divorced to get a loan to buy a home. This fits into a very long pattern of behaviour that we see from the Australian Labor Party. We know, with their prioritisation of superannuation over homeownership, they're throwing young Australians to the kerb on their dreams and aspirations to own their own homes. For those people who find themselves going through significant life events, such as divorce, in their 40s or their 50s, particularly women, the biggest impact on their retirement security is whether they're able to get into homeownership before they retire with enough time to retire their debt on a mortgage. They are being told by the Australian Labor Party, the Labor opposition and their mates in the super sector, who want to cream those same people's superannuation for their own profits and bonuses, 'No, we know what's best for you.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party doesn't care about these people's concerns or interests, because at the heart of its political agenda is a patronising world view that it has better judgement than people who can stand on their own two feet. Those opposite would rather older women had their superannuation eaten away by rent than for them to be able to enjoy the benefits of home ownership. They would rather keep them poor. That is their legacy. It may not be their intent, but it is most certainly the outcome. We see this consistently in their constant efforts to prioritise superannuation and their fund manager mates, to prioritise their fund manager mates' bonuses over the aspirations, dreams, opportunities and empowerment of Australians and their families. It's disgusting. They run interference when we raise and highlight fees for no service charged by industry funds. Why? It's because of their political proximity to them. It's because of their alliances and their interests and because they take donations, fees and support from exactly the same funds.</span>

That's why I am proud to stand for 'Home first, super second', and I make no apology about it. What it will do is provide an opportunity for tens of thousands, if not millions, of Australians to have a better, more prosperous working life, and it will put them in a better position to save for their retirement than the alternative would.</span>

                    </a>  There is absolutely a congruence between access to credit, home ownership, superannuation and priorities in life, as well as the principles that sit behind them around empowerment for individuals and families. That's why these issues have such a relationship. The shadow Treasurer spoke specifically about home ownership, access to credit and the ability to borrow from the bank. Access to other forms of capital are a critical part of that story, too. The dishonesty from the Labor members who oppose regulation and legislation that remove restrictive lending comes from a fundamental misunderstanding of credit availability. You just need to listen to the Reserve Bank of Australia's governor, who often appears before the Economics Committee. I see the former deputy chair of the Economics Committee in the chamber right now. He knows that, when the Reserve Bank governor comes before the committee, he tells us exactly what his attitude is towards economic conditions and circumstances and the issues before him. Every time the Reserve Bank governor came before our committee last year, he spoke about, and was asked questions about, Australia's restrictive lending laws. He said that the guidance notes that were being issued by the regulators were directly hampering the capacity of people to access credit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More critically, the removal of restrictive lending laws would not lead to the ridiculous circumstances boasted by those on the opposition benches. The macroprudential framework that has been put in place by the regulators would ensure that lending was appropriate. What we wouldn't have is needless paperwork and needless delay to 'yes'. We wouldn't have needless situations where young Australians who want to buy their first home miss out because the law gets in their way. What we want to do is make sure that the law not only protects consumers but also empowers them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why empowerment through home ownership is so critical. Under our current laws, not just in restrictive lending but in other areas, like the prioritisation of superannuation over home ownership, we see the empowerment of capital at the expense of the consumer—at the expense of the citizen. That any member could sit in this place and say they're going to put capital before citizens and their empowerment, you'd have to start to question who it is they're here to represent. It's only citizens who vote for them, and they vote for them to come into this place to stand up for them, their community, their family and their country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I support this legislation. The pattern of behaviour from our opponents has been to stand up for capital at the expense of citizens. We on this side of the chamber are in favour of laws which empower citizens over capital.</span>

That's why the current laws don't work and why the current laws don't protect people, but pity them. Our focus is on what we need to do to mobilise people—individuals, families, communities and country—to be successful. That's what we want to empower: every Australian's chance at their own success.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first recommendation of the Hayne royal commission into banking and financial services, which, remember, came about because of irresponsible credit practices and irresponsible lending by the banks, was that the National Consumer Credit Protection Act should not be amended to alter the obligation to assess unsuitability. And yet that's exactly what this government is doing. That's what this bill does; they're flying in the face of the first recommendation of the banking royal commission. Have they learnt nothing? What short memories they have!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Supporting Economic Recovery) Bill 2020 scraps responsible lending obligations under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act. What are those responsible lending obligations? There are three of them. Firstly, the licensee must:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a) make reasonable inquiries about the consumer's requirements and objectives …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's completely reasonable, completely understandable and should be there. The second one is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(b) make reasonable inquiries about the consumer's financial situation; …</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what the bank or lending institution is required to do. Of course, that's entirely reasonable and entirely appropriate. You're not going to lend money to someone without making inquiries about their income and their expenditure, are you? It happened in the lead-up to the global financial crisis, and that's why the world ended up in a mess. The third one is that the licensee is required to:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(c) take reasonable steps to verify the consumer's financial situation; …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That includes both their income and their expenditure. Again, that's a very, very reasonable requirement for a bank or a lending institution, to ask about those who are applying for credit and whether or not they have the financial wherewithal to pay the loan back. Of course that's a reasonable obligation on a credit provider. And yet these are the obligations that this government wants to remove from our national consumer credit laws. It is unbelievable!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These obligations apply only to consumer credit contracts; they don't apply to commercial credit contracts. They've never applied to commercial credit contracts. So we're talking here only about the average wage earner—a mum and a dad trying to buy a new home, a young person trying to get into the housing market or someone going to get a loan to buy a new car. Of course the banks and the lending institutions should ask these reasonable questions about whether or not someone has the ability to pay that loan back and, indeed, what their income is. These are reasonable laws, yet this government wants to get rid of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In removing those responsible lending obligations for products other than small amount credit contracts and consumer leases, what this government is doing is potentially damaging Australia's economy into the future. I've asked myself: 'Why are the government doing this? Why are they getting rid of these reasonable laws, particularly in the wake of the Hayne royal commission, which recommended in its No. 1 recommendation that these laws remain?' Well, the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer, who introduced this bill, have said that the current regulation is damaging the supply of credit. Those were the Assistant Treasurer's words, and the Assistant Treasurer, in his second reading speech, said that 'flexibility for lenders' was required. Whenever the coalition talk about flexibility, it should raise alarm bells amongst Australian workers and Australian consumers. But, when they talk about flexibility for banks, it should raise even more alarm bells, because we saw what happened over the last decade when the big four banks and other massive lending institutions had flexibility in laws not only around providing credit but around pandering to people to get them to take on credit, particularly around credit cards and other loan instruments. So people should be very, very sceptical of the government when in the outline of this bill, when they present it to the parliament, they say that they are trying to present more flexibility for banks in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to some of the findings of the royal commission about this notion that credit regulation is damaging the supply of credit. The Treasury had something to say about this in their submission to the Hayne royal commission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is little evidence to suggest that the recent tightening in credit standards, including through APRA's prudential measures or the actions taken by ASIC in respect of RLOs—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">responsible lending obligations—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">has materially affected the overall availability of credit.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the view of Treasury. It's the view of the Treasurer's own department, submitted to the royal commission. The Assistant Treasurer's own department has said that the responsible lending laws have not harmed the availability of credit. Yet the Assistant Treasurer comes in here and completely contradicts his own department, the evidence that was presented before the royal commission and the findings of the royal commission to present this bill, which does the complete opposite and relaxes those responsible lending obligations. It goes completely against the Assistant Treasurer's own department and their advice.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It gets worse. Treasury goes on to say:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… there has likely been an improvement in the credit quality of marginal borrowers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury have said to the royal commission, 'These laws are working and we want them to remain in place,' yet the Treasurer completely ignores his own department and completely ignores the royal commission and gets rid of these responsible lending laws through this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commissioner himself, Hayne, said in the conclusion to this section around the responsible lending laws in the report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… if 'appropriately managed, ensuring the industry consistently meets the requirements of existing laws will likely enhance rather than detract from macroeconomic performance'.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There you've got it. It's actually going to be better for the Australian economy if we leave these laws in place. Yet this government is completely ignoring that advice and the advice of its own department and is getting rid of them. And it's getting rid of them despite the protest of consumer groups, who've also said that it's irresponsible to scrap these laws and that it would potentially lead to significant consumer harm.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These organisations include the Consumer Action Law Centre, the Financial Rights Legal Centre, Financial Counselling Australia, Choice, the Indigenous Consumer Assistance Network, and Redfern Legal Centre. A significant part of these organisations' work is providing assistance and legal advice in relation to consumer credit in Australia, particularly when it goes wrong for the consumer and particularly when people experience that disadvantage and end up in a difficult financial situation. These organisations have deep expertise in our credit laws based on lived experiences of the people they help. It's no surprise that they strongly oppose this bill. They say that the Morrison government's changes will result in harm to individuals, families and communities and set Australia up for household debt disaster in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The chief executive of the Financial Rights Legal Centre, Karen Cox, said that her organisation 'continues to see the financial hardship legacy of irresponsible lending practices that pre-date the banking royal commission'. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our Government wants free-flowing credit to reign at a time when unprecedented numbers of Australians have had to ask for loan deferrals amidst COVID-19. It simply defies logic. The last thing people need now is inappropriate and unaffordable credit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fiona Guthrie, the chief executive of Financial Counselling Australia, said that financial counsellors were shocked by what was being proposed. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If these laws are scrapped, financial counsellors will see more people drowning in debt with all that entails: greater risks of suicide, more bankruptcies, more family violence and family breakdown, more homelessness and the negative flow on effects to people's mental and physical health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the view of the people who deal with the ugly side of this every day. Yet this government ignores that. They ignore the advice of Treasury, they ignore the advice of the Hayne royal commission and they proceed with these laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why were those responsible-lending laws put in place? They were put in place in the wake of the global financial crisis, where we saw banks and financial institutions across the world lending for basically anything, lending with very little evidence of incomes and expenditure. That, of course, led to asset price bubbles, particularly in housing. When the whole thing came crashing down, it wasn't the executives at the banks and the lending institutions who suffered. No, it was the workers and the people who had taken out those unsustainable loans, because the price of the assets against which they'd borrowed crashed, and the banks foreclosed on the assets because the value of the loan was greater than the value of the asset, and people were left without housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what those consumer groups are talking about in relation to these laws being removed once again. In the Australian context, that was pre-dated by the wealth scandals that occurred in our banks, in our financial institutions—the pushing of financial products, particularly credit cards, and other unsuitable loan products onto consumers because of the incentives that were given within these organisations, through bonuses and other pay advances, to get people to take on credit that they couldn't sustain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Government had to act; we were forced to act. Government doesn't just wake up and say, 'Hey, let's regulate the banking industry!' It was well over a decade of pain and suffering—literally hundreds of thousands of Australians losing billions of dollars—that forced government to act. And Labor forced the government into a royal commission that they had voted against 26 times. They never wanted it. They didn't want to see a spotlight shone on what was going on with their mates in the banking sector. The government voted against it 26 times. These laws were put in place to ensure that that can't happen again in Australia, and this government wants to get rid of those responsible lending laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I make this prediction: in years to come, when we are looking back on the next financial disaster in this country and saying: 'How did we allow this to happen? How did we allow the housing crash to occur? How did we allow millions of Australians to lose their homes and lose their incomes?', we can point to this point in time when this bill went through. It will be on this government to explain to those millions of Australians who will be suffering at that point in the future why they did this to them, why they allowed this to occur in this parliament and another global financial crisis style recession to ensue for a lot of people to suffer through. It will be on this government to explain to people why they allowed that to occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why Labor is opposed to this reform. The government is taking away the regulation that was put in place after this parliament was forced to act by the Australian people, by workers and consumers, because they'd had a gutful of the rip-offs and the scandals in this industry. This government is now turning its back on those people who suffered, and, again, marching down the path of deregulating this industry and ensuring that in the future people will be vulnerable and potentially subject to credit that they can't afford. When the whole thing comes crashing down it will once again be up to the Labor Party to try to restore some decent regulation and some reasonableness to this industry.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="291387" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAMILTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:06</span>):  The National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Supporting Economic Recovery) Bill 2020, which I'm very happy to speak in support of, is a bill that Australians would expect of this coalition government—that is, one that supports jobs and growth. In the simplest understanding of this bill lies the very clear intention to support those individuals who wish to take advantage of the rising tide that is currently lifting all Australian boats. All around us, the evidence of economic recovery can be seen; I will describe some of that in a moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, it's important to view this bill in the context of the world around it. The year 2020 saw the greatest economic challenge the world has seen since the Great Depression. Stories that were once passed down to our generation from grandparents and great-great-grandparents are once again the stories of our time. I think of my uncle, Don Prentice, telling stories of his time during the Great Depression, of packing up his swag and going to find work. We aren't there, but those memories remain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The year 2020 changed us. It shocked our economy and hurt many people's health and security. Whilst Australia has done very well in comparison to other economies, we have hurt. Just as the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 can be viewed as responding to the challenges of its time, as the previous speaker detailed—in our case it was the global financial crisis—this bill responds to the challenges of today, and they're very different challenges. As difficult and dark as 2020 was for so many of us, Australia ended 2020 with consumer confidence at a 10-year high and the people of Australia found their feet after the initial turbulence of the pandemic. They found faith in the community's ability to work together, in our health system's ability to guide us towards safer shores and in the Morrison government's plan to rebuild our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill offers something of an opening up of Australia's ability to access credit, and that is exactly what the people of Australia's confidence calls for. As a people we understand now is a time of growth, that 2021 must be a time that Australia proudly and deliberately takes a step forward out of the uncertainty that engulfed us in 2020. As a government we support that confidence. As a government we understand that a confident nation needs our support, not our suppression. As a government we understand the importance of leading with our strengths, and today we must view that 10-year high in consumer confidence as a great strength of this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year I spent time with Downs Group Training, listening to their plans to develop workforce capacity and capability in the Toowoomba region. I heard from their CEO, Kris McCue, on his organisation's optimism for the year ahead. We're talking about young tradespeople entering the market, viewing all the work that's happening, particularly as a result of the wonderfully received HomeBuilder scheme. It's great to see them entering their careers with optimism. As I often, do, I popped my head into one of Toowoomba's many fine cafes—on this occasion, The Finch. I had a great chat with the owners, Dan and Edwina, who confessed to me the worst-kept secret in Toowoomba, which is that they are expanding—a second Finch. I'm sorry, guys, but the word is out. This is a business that was initially hit hard by the pandemic shutdowns but which survived with the help of the Morrison government's economic recovery plan and their lifelines and which has now come out on the other side of that very difficult time with confidence. They are no longer looking for the light at the end of the tunnel but are now looking for the sunglasses as a bright new day dawns. It's not here yet, but it is dawning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My local Toowoomba Toyota dealer tells me that his sale lots, which were almost completely empty only 12 months ago, are now full of people looking to take advantage of the government's economic recovery plans. The comeback is on. Almost 800,000 jobs were created in the past seven months, and the participation rate has recovered and reached a record high of 66.2 per cent. We know that our temporary JobKeeper payments and the billions in economic support provided enabled Australians to stay in work or connected to their employer. That is great news. It's a great thing for households, businesses and the economy. We know that our COVID-19 economic support measures helped families and have boosted business balance sheets by more than $200 billion. Again, at the heart of this government's efforts was a desire to support individuals and businesses during the pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are continuing to work with business so that the private sector can lead our recovery. The government's full expensing for new business investments, creating jobs and our loss carry back scheme provides a much-needed cash flow boost for those who continue to do it tough. In Groom, that's assisting some 4,000 small and medium businesses. I believe the Prime Minister described this as 'a game changer like no other' and I heartily agree with that assessment. These measures saved not just livelihoods but lives. They kept food on the table, ensured that bills were paid and, importantly, ensured that the breadwinners of households stayed connected to employment. This meant there was significant economic flow across the economy, supporting jobs, particularly in small and family businesses. Feedback from business across the Toowoomba region has been clear that this support was critical during the lockdowns, particularly in regions such as mine, where case numbers were relatively low and people were going about their business safely and as normally as possible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To support those businesses to get back up and running more quickly, with existing staff back at work, serving and selling, JobKeeper supported some 4,700 businesses in Groom, keeping us connected as a community. As JobKeeper steps off and businesses get stronger, our government will continue to support Australian households and businesses, and we'll do that by putting more money back into Australians' pockets and protecting more of what they have earned. In my electorate of Groom, 65,600 taxpayers benefit from this government's tax relief measures, and that's great. It means there is more money circulating in our local economy across the Darling Downs, supporting businesses in our community. As a result, we've seen the consumer and business confidence recover as the strong restrictions come off. It is the intent of the bill before us to support households, small businesses and the economic recovery. It's critically important that we deliver our economic recovery plan and provide households and businesses with more confidence to invest and create more jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of that plan is simplifying Australia's credit framework and supporting the flow of credit to the Australian economy, with interest rates remaining at historic lows and fiscal policy having a greater role in supporting national economic growth, especially on the back of a coronavirus induced economic downturn. It's important that our regulatory settings are adequate for the issues of today. This bill will help facilitate, rather than hinder, the economic recovery and protect consumers and borrowers. This is not about the short term. This is not about getting a rush of credit. As part of our recovery plan, this bill is about improving the financial services sector for the medium to longer term. This bill removes excessive, duplicative barriers that hamper access to credit approval and make the process more timely. Our regulatory framework does not have to be burdensome to be strong, and this bill demonstrates as much. As businesses recover and seek credit to invest, we need to ensure our regulatory framework incentivises investment in jobs in our economy. This bill will enable that, while also protecting consumers, particularly vulnerable consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill ensures authorised deposit-taking institutions will continue to comply with APRA's lending standards, requiring sound credit assessment and approvals criteria. The bill adopts key elements of APRA's ADI lending standards and applies them to non-ADIs. In reducing the duplicative burden, the bill enables lenders to rely on the information provided by borrowers, replacing the current practice of 'lender beware' with a borrower responsibility principle. The credit assessment process relying on information provided by a consumer, particularly by a small business where, in large, information is preverified through an accountant or other financial adviser, will avoid the need for extensive and intrusive verification processes. Of course, if there are reasonable grounds to believe the information being provided is unreliable, the bill maintains that lenders can make inquiries in relation to a consumer's situation like the existing conduct obligations. This enables a strong regulatory standard of assessment as to whether a credit application is suitable prior to making a loan without overburdening the applicant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government recognises that we need to simplify the system, and this bill does that by moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach while at the same time strengthening consumer protections for those who need it. This bill will protect the vulnerable in my community, especially within Toowoomba city. Toowoomba has for many years been designated by the federal government as a refugee and humanitarian settlement area because of the success of well-established collaboration and partnerships at different levels of government, settlement services, NGOs and the diverse community who provide support to new arrivals. On 22 June 2013 Toowoomba Regional Council became the third local government area in Queensland to become a refugee welcome zone. We are one of the largest regional refugee settlement areas and are very proud of that. I acknowledge Mayor Paul Antonio's fine leadership in this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our most recent arrivals include 2½ thousand Yazidi people with a refugee background. Many experience language difficulties and, unfortunately, trauma issues. Catholic Social Services, through the Toowoomba Refugee and Migrant Service, TRAMS, provide refugees and migrants who are new to our region with support to get settled into community life and enjoy a smooth transition into Australian society. The TRAMS program provides these refugees and migrants with assistance to become self-reliant and to participate equitably in Australian society as soon as possible after their arrival in the Toowoomba community. I note two small businesses in central Toowoomba are run by Yazidis. It's great to see them engaging so heartily in the community and doing so well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a recent meeting with Catholic Social Services it was highlighted that, due to trauma, these new residents are vulnerable and this often results in uninformed decision-making that consequently ends in bad outcomes, including bad financial outcomes. This section of society are still settling in and finding their way. They often have the barriers of learning a new language, learning how to read and write, learning new skills, customs and laws, and engaging in the workforce. This bill, particularly as it relates to small-amount credit contracts, helps protect these groups. These changes will make it easier for the majority of Australians and small businesses to access credit, will reduce red tape, will improve competition and will ensure that the strongest consumer protections are targeted at the most vulnerable Australians. I recommend this bill to the chamber.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  Late last year when the Treasurer announced this policy in the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Supporting Economic Recovery) Bill 2020 some commentators who were sceptical of it and were opposed to it said that this is a solution looking for a problem. On reflection, I actually think that that characterisation of this policy is far too generous. It is true to say that there is no problem, but it is far too generous to call this policy a solution to anything. It is not a solution; it is a massive retrograde ideological step backwards in our regulatory framework. It is a step backwards that is going to put at risk many of the most vulnerable in our community. So, please, let's not at any point in this debate mischaracterise what we're seeing here today as a solution. It is a highly risky step backwards to a time long ago when the financial services sector contained many more risks for the most vulnerable. It is an unwinding of some of the most important protections in our financial regulatory structure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the context in which this absurd bill is being brought to this chamber? The context of course is that we are now two years down the track from having received a very hefty, rigorous and well-received royal commission report from Commissioner Hayne. That's two years where only a third of the recommendations have been acted on in any meaningful way. That's far, far too long, when so many substantive recommendations are sitting idle. And yet in this chamber now today, we're being asked to support a bill from the government that is actually going to fly in the face of the very first recommendation of that royal commission. So at a time when two-thirds of the recommendations from that royal commission stand idle and when so much of the poor behaviour, so much of the malfeasance that shocked the public and so much of that behaviour which generated the public policy recommendations, stand idle we're being asked to unwind, to fly in the face of and to contradict recommendation 1.1. As earlier speakers on this side have noted, recommendation 1.1 was that the national consumer credit protection laws not be changed. And now we're being asked to gut them, to totally weaken consumer protections that have proved to be so vital.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a remarkable act of maladministration. As other speakers have noted, the National Consumer Credit Protection Act was brought in by the Gillard government in response to the GFC. What we're being asked to consider in this bill is a structure in which the protections in that act are going to be materially wound back. We're going to have an arrangement where lending decisions by ADIs—by authorised deposit-taking institutions—will be regulated by APRA, a body which is very expert in prudential regulation but does not have a consumer-facing expertise. And non-ADI lenders will be regulated by legislative instruments by the Treasurer and will be enforced by ASIC. So rather than the strong current arrangements, we're going to end up with consumer lending being regulated by three separate sets of rules and two different regulators. The remarkable achievement of this government is that they're going to simultaneously water down provisions and make them more complicated. This will become a case study for public policy departments around the country in how not to undertake regulatory change. Of course, as speakers on this side have noted on numerous occasions, this watering down and overcomplication of current arrangements flies in the face, not surprisingly, of one of the key recommendations of the Hayne royal commission.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very disingenuous proposal being put by the government. Speakers opposite, to the extent that they've been able to mount any kind of rationale for it, claim that it's based on insufficient credit growth when, as speakers on this side—the shadow Treasurer and other speakers—have pointed out, credit growth is strong and many areas of credit are at record levels. It is a completely specious argument. Other speakers mount the argument that it's critical for the protection of individual rights, that people should be able to borrow absolutely whatever they want in any circumstances. That's a hollow rhetorical flourish. Let's be clear: it's a highly disingenuous flourish by those opposite. If they genuinely believe that—if they're genuinely so wedded to individual rights above anything else, then why don't we get rid of consumer protection altogether? If it's such a great thing to water down these provisions then let's get rid of them altogether.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at what the experts say in relation to this proposal from the government and the Treasurer. Karen Cox, the CEO of the Financial Rights Legal Centre, who was the opening witness to the banking royal commission, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The problem people are having right now is too much debt and not enough income. @ausgov solution is to take on more debt with fewer protections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Watering down credit protections will leave individuals and families at severe risk of being pushed into credit arrangements that will hurt them in the long term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fiona Guthrie, the CEO of Financial Counselling Australia, an organisation that represents the people at the coalface of having to help vulnerable people who have been abused by the system, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As we learnt to our cost during the GFC, weaker lending standards mean people will be loaded up with as much debt as possible. There is significant profit to be made in pushing borrowers to the edge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Financial Counselling Australia undertook a very important survey of financial counsellors. Ninety-seven per cent of those surveyed said that responsible lending laws should remain. So they agree with Commissioner Hayne; they agree with the Commonwealth Treasury; they agree with the experts—97 per cent. And 94 per cent of financial counsellors either strongly agreed or agreed with the proposition that responsible lending laws are an important component of consumer protection. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We got rid of the idea of 'buyer beware' in consumer law decades ago.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a completely retrograde step. As Alan Kirkland points out, this is going back decades to a completely old mindset in terms of how the regulatory system should be structured. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He also said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Bank recently said that the flow of credit is above pre-COVID levels and that lending is growing at a strong pace. And none of the big banks opposed the responsible lending laws at the recent House of Representatives Economics Committee hearings</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Gerard Brody rightly points out, all big four bank CEOs gave evidence over the last few months to the House economics committee. None of them argued that these laws should be gutted. None of them contradicted recommendation 1.1 of the royal commission. The big four bank CEOs are also instrumental in the credit system, and they all supported the notion that suitable protections should remain in place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Kevin Davis, one of the most distinguished independent academic experts on financial regulation and the macroeconomy in Australia, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The axing of responsible lending obligations … is particularly egregious … This is the triumph of ideology and vested interests over logic and evidence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Kevin Davis's comments had great foresight. It is a triumph of ideology, because all that we've heard from those opposite are these hollow rhetorical flourishes on individual rights, with very little intellectual content behind them. If they truly believe some of those rhetorical flourishes, as I said, why not get rid of consumer protection altogether? As Kevin Davis said, it flies in the face of logic and evidence, because, as multiple speakers on this side have indicated, credit growth is strong and some components of credit are at record levels. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is absolutely absurd to come in here and to assert that this is necessary for the economic recovery. It is clearly not. Economic experts say it's not. Treasury says it's not, the big banks say it's not, and even a superficial reading of basic ABS statistics says it's not. Treasury has said that responsible lending laws are providing stability to the finance system overall. They have said that they are not impeding the flow of credit and that scrapping them will lead to 'more instances of consumer harm'. Josh Mennen, from the Australian Lawyers Alliance, said that axing banks' responsible lending obligations is 'a recipe for financial hardship'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, APRA and ASIC weren't properly consulted. Sean Hughes, ASIC's commissioner with responsibility for credit, had no input. He told the House economics committee late last year that he was first advised about these plans when he read the Treasurer's media statement. Now he's going to have to be responsible for an important part of regulating this new dog's breakfast, this more complex but watered-down set of arrangements. The banking regulator only got notice in early August. The process was rushed and lacked consultation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there are all these experts. We have experts across consumer advocacy. We have experts from financial counselling—the people who are actually seeing these complex cases of financial abuse. We have macroeconomists in Treasury and macroeconomists in academia. We have commercial experts. We have big four bank CEOs. We have lawyers. We have regulators. We have the government's own advisers in Treasury. None of these people support contradicting the royal commission. So this government sits on two-thirds of the royal commission's recommendations but comes in here with the most specious of arguments to overturn the royal commission's first recommendation, which is one of its most important. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This, of course, is going to be absolutely disastrous in many communities around Australia—communities like mine, in Fraser. I hear many harrowing cases of Australians dealing with situations of financial abuse, financial distress and insecurity. Brimbank Melton Community Legal Centre has told me harrowing examples of many residents of Fraser who have been financially abused. They shared examples like that of Sarah, whose lack of fluency with written English was exploited by an unscrupulous lender to saddle her with unsustainable debt, culminating in repossession and severe hardship. Some of those opposite might come in and say that individual rights trump all, but, as I say, it's a hollow rhetorical flourish. If they genuinely believe that I want those same people to come in here and say, 'Be gone with all consumer protection,' I think it's a very disingenuous ideological argument for a sham piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What about Laura—of course, not the person's real name—who applied for a credit card? She's another vulnerable, low-income person. She applied for a zero per cent credit card. When the credit card was approved and provided to her, she found out later that she was actually paying interest. Without her ever finding out, she was given a different credit card to the one that she was offered. The onus is on those opposite to explain how these new laws will be sufficient to provide protection for people in Sarah's situation or Laura's situation. The lawyers and the financial counsellors and the other experts—the commercial experts and macroeconomic experts—are very concerned that watering down these laws will mean that people like Sarah and Laura will have far less recourse to remedies. Those opposite have to justify why putting people like Sarah and Laura in harm's way is justified, and they have no arguments—no justification whatsoever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be very clear what we're facing in this chamber today. It is an absolutely reprehensible bill that we're facing. We have a government that resisted a royal commission 26 times. They did not want the royal commission to happen. It shouldn't be a surprise that when they begrudgingly received the royal commission's findings they dragged their feet to implement those recommendations. Two years later, two-thirds of them still sit on the shelf. What's even more galling than the fact that two-thirds of the royal commission's recommendations sit unattended to when they're so important, when people continue to be vulnerable, when people continue to be abused, is that the government is now coming into this place and arguing that we should unwind what has been done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said, it's a highly, highly disingenuous set of arguments that they're running. It flies in the face of evidence. There is no argument possible to be made that the economic recovery relies on watering down consumer credit protections. Consumer credit growth is strong, and all of the experts—experts at Treasury, experts at the big four banks, expert macroeconomists in academia—point to the fact that we do not need this bill today to support the economic recovery. Other experts in financial counselling, experts in the law and experts in consumer advocacy groups point to the fact that there is real vulnerability. So this is not a solution looking for a problem; this is a massive, detrimental step backwards with a disingenuous argument in its support.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr YOUNG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:33</span>):  I rise to speak on the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Supporting Economic Recovery) Bill 2020. Unlike some others who go and talk to groups, I have actually been out in my community and talked to actual businesses, and they are telling me something completely different—that they are struggling to get finances to expand, to open new businesses. So this is a welcome bill, in their view.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For many of us, borrowing money from a bank or some other lender has become a simple fact of life. If you want to buy a house, chances are that at one time or another you've spoken to a bank representative or a broker to find out how much credit you can borrow and what your repayments would be. If you've ever operated a business, there's a strong chance you've had to borrow money, particularly to manage the startup costs. The amount you can borrow is based on many factors such as your family's income, existing debts and day-to-day expenses, like putting food on the table, sending the kids to school and keeping the lights on. Let's not forget there's always a certain amount of risk a person takes on when entering a contract to borrow money, and there's also risk to the lender. These are the things that happen in our lives, things unforeseen, that can change our circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Take the COVID-19 pandemic, for example. When it struck in early 2020, many businesses had their bottom lines wiped out overnight. Thousands of hardworking people across the country lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Businesses were still expected to pay their rents to their landlords, and the landlords relied on that income to pay back their loans. That's fair enough. The government introduced measures to minimise this impact, and now, around 12 months since the pandemic first hit, the economy is back on track. There are some sectors and many people who are still doing it tough, but as a nation we are headed in the right direction. The COVID vaccines are now being rolled out and the nation is bouncing back from the devastating impacts of the pandemic. In fact, we are beating market expectations. Last month, 29,000 new jobs were created. The unemployment rate is now at 6.4 per cent. It's the first time since April last year that the unemployment rate has been this low.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in the good old days of 2019, no-one could have predicted what 2020 would bring. That's why it's more important than ever to find the right balance between having an efficient flow of credit and ensuring there are adequate safeguards in place. I believe the proposed amendment we are debating here today achieves this balance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can remember starting a new business in May 2007, just before the GFC, and going to the bank, backing myself and putting our family home up as security to start a new venture. Since then, I have had the pleasure, along with my business partner, of purchasing another business. Had I been refused that business loan due to lending laws that were too tough, I would not have been able to employ around 15 people, contribute millions of dollars in GST and thousands of dollars in income tax; rent two commercial premises, which creates income for the owners of those buildings; and purchase millions of dollars in goods, which keeps truck drivers, warehouse people, bookkeepers and sales staff in jobs—the list goes on and on. All of these benefits to our economy would not have happened had we not got our initial business loan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So these changes we have put forward will become a vital part of our ongoing economic comeback. As I have already stated, credit is a fact of life for many of us. Credit can be used to establish or expand a business and create new jobs. Credit can be used to build a house, helping to keep tradies and builders in jobs. Credit can be used to buy other household items, like a car, computer, dishwasher or whatever it might be. These purchases support our economy and keep people in jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment that we are proposing will make existing responsible lending obligations apply only to high-cost credit products or small amount credit contracts and consumer leases. The reforms will remove unnecessary barriers to credit while maintaining important consumer protections for those who need them. It's our job as a government to remove barriers, not put them up. It's our job to make it easier to do business in this country, not harder. And these reforms will do that. The existing obligations have brought about greater risk aversion in credit assessments than originally intended. They've imposed burdensome regulations on consumers and lenders, resulting in delayed credit approvals and increasing borrowing costs. They've also acted as a barrier to borrowers wanting to seek out new credit, refinance or get a better deal. These obligations have led to a one-size-fits-all approach to credit assessments which is overly burdensome for both borrowers and lenders. They are no longer fit for purpose and they risk slowing Australia's economic recovery from the pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes we are proposing will reduce the time and cost of credit assessments for consumers and businesses, cut red tape for consumers seeking a credit product, improve competition by making it easier to switch lenders and enhance access to credit for small businesses. It's important to note, though, that improved lending flexibility will not diminish the consumer protections in place. In fact, for some products these protections will be enhanced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment seeks to retain responsible lending obligations for small amount credit contracts and consumer leases. These are high-cost forms of borrowing and are more typically accessed by some of Australia's most vulnerable consumers. For example, a loan of up to $2,000 with a short-term contract is considered to be a small amount credit contract. A consumer lease lets you rent an item like a laptop, TV or fridge for a set amount of time, after which either you must return the product or you may have an option to buy it outright. While these products can be useful for people to access as an emergency source of funding, repeat borrowing can pose significant issues for a person on a low income. It can lead to a spiral of debt, with repayments consuming a large portion of that person's income. The repayments can become crippling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be honest about this: crippling debt can ruin lives. It can destroy marriages and families, and it can even lead to suicide. This is something of particular concern to me, as my electorate of Longman contains some true Aussie battler suburbs. The last thing I want is to see people in my electorate who are already doing it tough get into further financial trouble by borrowing money they should never have had access to in the first place. That's why the proposal here today seeks not only to retain responsible lending obligations for those types of high-cost products but to introduce even more protections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms will: introduce a cap on the costs a lessor can charge; introduce new protected earnings amounts for these products; prohibit providers of these products from making unsolicited invitations to current and former customers; and prohibit door-to-door selling of consumer leases. The government supports the principle that consumers should only apply for a consumer lease when they proactively choose to do so. The new protected earnings amounts will limit the proportion of income consumers can devote to these products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms are designed to limit consumer harm while maintaining access to these forms of borrowing. Responsible lending obligations will be retained on these products regardless of whether they are provided by a bank or some other lender. For other credit products banks will continue to be regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA. The standard requires banks to implement a credit risk management framework. This includes having prudent policies and processes to manage credit risk and maintain sound credit assessment and approval criteria to appropriately assess a borrower's credit risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Banks will continue to be subject to a broader range of prudential regulations administered by APRA which reflect their importance to the financial system as holders of Australians' deposits. Tough new lending standards for non-bank lenders will be introduced that will maintain consumer protections while reducing the compliance burden for both lenders and borrowers. They require lenders to have a sound credit assessment and approval processes to ensure consumers are able to meet their obligations without substantial hardship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These standards are adopted from APRA's prudential standards to ensure consistency between bank and non-bank lenders. They also introduce a borrower responsibility principle, enabling lenders to rely on information provided by consumers unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that the information is unreliable. This process addresses the current practice of 'lender beware' and addresses the excessive risk aversion which has progressively entered the system, restricting the flow of credit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The main new change here is that, unlike responsible lending obligations, the new lending standards do not impose individual conduct level obligations. This enables lenders to adopt more risk based lending that is attuned to the needs and circumstances of the borrower and credit product. It is a move away from the onerous tick-a-box verification practices of the past. People will still have access to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority when they have a financial dispute with their lender. These new lending standards for non-bank lenders will be enforced by ASIC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that the new standards will not apply to credit which is in part for a small-business purpose. In essence, this will make permanent the temporary small-business loan measure that was extended following the start of the pandemic. Small-business lending was never intended to be captured by the credit act, but recent interpretation of the responsible lending obligations has meant some small businesses have struggled to access credit. This has been particularly evident for primary producers, where it is difficult to distinguish between home and business. The new lending standards avoid this confusion. They will give small-business customers the confidence to approach lenders for business purposes knowing that the process to obtain approval will be less complex and intrusive. In practice this means that once a lender identifies that part of the credit is for a small-business purpose it will switch off the obligations contained in the non-ADI standard. However, a safeguard will be included to ensure that the small-business purpose is not minor or incidental to the overall purpose of the credit. This will address the risk of consumers inappropriately nominating a small-business purpose to avoid the lending obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms retain consumer protections. Lenders must put in place systems, policies and processes that comply with the standard, to ensure they assess a borrower's capacity to repay the credit being extended without substantial hardship. A lender will be in breach of the law if they lend without having in place systems, policies and processes that comply with the law. Lenders that repeatedly fail to comply with the processes or practices they have in place for credit assessment will also be in breach of the new lending standards. Both contraventions attract significant penalties. Borrowers will retain access to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority for dispute resolution and restitution. Protections are being increased among credit assistance providers, with the bill extending the best-interests obligations to other credit assistance providers. This will ensure credit assistance providers act in consumers' best interests and place consumers' interests before their own when providing credit assistance. These obligations will begin six months after royal assent, to allow industry time to prepare for the new requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite what some would have us believe, these reforms will not lead to irresponsible lending. The new standards for non-bank lenders will ensure lenders have sound credit-assessment-and-approval processes to assess a consumer's capacity to repay debt without substantial hardship. The new standards align with the APRA standards that apply to the banks. They will ensure that, regardless of lender, credit continues to be extended in a manner attuned to the needs of the consumer and the credit product. Additionally, the government's reforms increase consumer protections among credit assistance providers. This will ensure that providers assisting consumers to access credit act in consumers' best interests and place consumers' interests before their own. It is vital that credit continues to flow in the Australian economy, with the appropriate consumer protections in place. It is my belief that this amendment achieves that outcome.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:46</span>):  I've heard for some months, in the lead-up to this debate, how bad this bill is. I've been written to by my local community organisations—South East Community Links and Casey North Community Information and Support Service. Financial counsellors have written to us. CHOICE Australia has been all over the media for months. But I have to say, having now spent a bit of time over the last couple of days looking at the detail, I'm shocked that the government would introduce a piece of legislation this bad. It is truly appalling for Australian consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Supporting Economic Recovery) Bill 2020, scraps entirely the responsible lending laws introduced over a decade ago, after the global financial crisis, which protect Australian consumers from predatory lending. While the government were dragged kicking and screaming into calling the banking royal commission, they at least said afterwards, 'Well, we accept the recommendations.' This bill breaks recommendation 1 of the royal commission's report. The royal commission into banking said, 'Do not amend the responsible lending laws.' They do not need to be amended. They're there for good reason. They provide stability in the financial system and protection for consumers. The government have effectively broken their promise in trying to scrap these laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's instructive to look at who wants this bill. It's not a long list. The big banks want the bill, the finance industry wants the bill and the Australian Banking Association wants the bill. That's about it. Why? So they can lend more money without checks and balances. It's that simple. It will be instructive to give a brief summary of what the laws do. All they do is ask the banks to do a bit of work and check documents properly, and they put a responsibility on the banks to do so. This is to protect consumers, most especially vulnerable consumers, of whom there are thousands in my electorate—and I'll get to that. They put the responsibility on the lenders to meet the standards—to verify documents and to understand who they're lending to. That's it. Why is the government doing it? Because the big banks want them to. The banks want to lend people more money; that's it. The government can't say that, though, can they, because it wouldn't sound very good. They don't want to be caught doing what the big banks want them to do, so they're pretending it's because of COVID. Just like with the wage cuts that we debated earlier this week, they're pretending, 'Because of COVID we've got to do these awful things.' They say there's a consumer credit squeeze that's threatening to derail the recovery. Apparently, according to the government, Australians can't get loans; they can't get credit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only problem is that that's patent nonsense. Just stop for a minute and think about the macro picture, the context that this sits in. Under the Liberals, Australian household debt as a share of GDP in this country, as of last year, was 119.4 per cent. The 2020 assessment of our global position showed that that's the second-highest of 41 countries in the world. Households in Australia are already bearing the second-highest percentage of debt of 41 countries, as assessed by the Bank for International Settlements. That's the context in which this bill comes trying to get households to borrow even more money, whether they can afford it or not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, in the real economy in Australia, lending's up by 10 per cent. Auction clearance rates are pushing north of 90 per cent in Sydney and have skyrocketed back in Melbourne. House prices are booming. Consumer credit has never been easier to get. The government's claim that we have a credit squeeze just doesn't add up. The statements and data from UBS bank and some others—members of the Banking Association and other industry associations—show limited to no evidence of any actual problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's who wants it: the banks, the finance industry and the Banking Association. When you have a look at the range of people and organisations that have come out and said, 'Do not do this, government and parliament; do not pass this bill,' aside from the banks there's pretty much no-one who supports it. CHOICE, the peak consumer organisation, are strongly opposed. They're worried that the relaxation of lending standards will let lenders off the hook and allow them to make more loans that are unsuitable for vulnerable borrowers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are the consumer groups. I said earlier that my electorate is lucky to be served by a number of wonderful local organisations—some of them with funding from the federal government, ironically. The government don't listen to the people they fund, who do this day in, day out: the financial counsellors who sit there and help the most vulnerable in society, who've got themselves into all sorts of messes, sometimes through bad choices and sometimes through life circumstances and sheer bad luck. Financial Counselling Australia have sent around a survey, and it's instructive just to have a look at this survey. It's been sent to all members. I haven't heard any of the government members even acknowledge these concerns. It's all tickety-boo! There's no problem! This is going to be terrific! Government speaker after government speaker is saying this. This is pretty much a guarantee they're giving that no-one's going to get themselves into trouble. What nonsense!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The financial counsellors are the people who sit there at the coalface talking to Australians with financial difficulties. Ninety-seven per cent of financial counsellors said the responsible lending laws should remain—97 per cent. Ninety-four per cent of financial counsellors either strongly agreed or agreed that responsible lending laws are an important part of consumer protection. Just about every one of them—over 90 per cent—uses these responsible lending laws every day in communities across Australia—regional areas and city areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Financial problems are not confined to disadvantaged areas, but they are concentrated in them, including my electorate, which on the statistics is one of the most socioeconomically disadvantaged places in the country. There are a lot of people in temporary work, casual work, already suffering from the government's wage cuts, cuts to penalty rates, casualised work and insecure work. Wages in this country since this government was elected have fallen in real terms. It's a shocking indictment on its so-called great economic management. Real wages have fallen. We're fifth last in the OECD for wage growth, out of 37 countries. This is the context in which these laws to allow people to borrow more money come: flat wages growth, casualised work and insecure work. It's a recipe for disaster. It is truly life-destroying when people get themselves into serious financial difficulties. For a lot of people in my electorate, 20 bucks is a lot of money. That's the extent to which people budget: down to their last 20 bucks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ninety-two per cent of financial counsellors agreed that, if the laws are repealed, they can expect to see many more clients with unaffordable debt. The majority of financial counsellors, 71 per cent, agreed that, if the laws are repealed, this will actually hinder the economic recovery, because once people get themselves into financial trouble they don't spend in the real economy; they spend every dollar of their income and everything they can scrape together servicing unaffordable debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Irresponsible lending, of course, still occurs despite these laws. It's these laws which enable financial counsellors to actually argue the toss and get a fair go for people who've been treated appallingly by banks and financial institutions. I'll quote from a letter from Susan Magee, the CEO of the Casey North Community Information &amp; Support Service: 'Our financial counselling team are regularly assisting clients who are overcommitted financially and experiencing severe financial and emotional distress as a result. Any reversal of these laws will further impact on workable outcomes for our clients and potentially leave them in a lifetime of debt, with the risk of losing assets including the family home or bankruptcy. The Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry quite clearly demonstrated the need to retain these laws.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Both of the local organisations have sent me case studies, all members have been sent case studies, of real-world impacts that happen to people right across Australia. Melissa, a 55-year-old woman in my electorate, fell prey to a scammer who preyed on lonely and vulnerable women living alone. She ended up with $120,000 worth of debt. This had been financed over 12 months by the bank—more personal loans; more mortgage advances; repeated increases to her credit card limit—all the signs were there—with no checks whatsoever made by the bank. A financial counsellor helped her make an ombudsman complaint, and they discovered there was a breach of the responsible lending laws. It saved her house. She was 55 years old; she had eight more years of working. If these laws were not there, Melissa would have lost her house and retired into utter poverty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">John's a guy in my electorate who's close to homelessness. He's a jobseeker. He's living from fortnightly JobSeeker payment to fortnightly JobSeeker payment. He went to his bank. He said: 'I need a $1,000 credit card. I need that to help manage my cash flow.' The bank said, 'No, you can only have $5,000.' He said: 'I don't want $5,000. I want $1,000.' They said, 'Don't worry about it; you can just spend the $1,000.' Of course, with the pressures of life, within six to 12 months John's drowning in debt. Five thousand dollars might not sound like a lot of money to people in this place, but it is a lot of money to people like John, trying to exist from pay cheque to pay cheque. He's already close to homelessness. This was resolved. They wiped most of the debt and left it at a level that he could pay off. It was only resolved due to the responsible lending laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have another example. A person whose only income is from the disability support pension was given a loan for a car where the payments left them without money for food or utilities. If these laws are scrapped, where's the protection for ordinary Australians? I have the most multicultural council area in the whole of Australia. They'll be particularly harsh for culturally and linguistically diverse people whose backgrounds have languages other than English as their primary language. I have heard of gamblers offered multiple $50,000 home loans within 12 months of each other with an unproven capacity to pay. A 72-year-old client was given a 30-year home loan. It's these laws which protect Australians from this kind of predatory lending, and the government wants to scrap them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also instructive, when thinking about these kinds of proposals, to look at what the experts say. People who actually reflect on good regulation and credit regulation, and whose job, day-in day-out, it is to look at the balance between credit and consumer protection. The academic criticism is clear. They say that relaxed consumer lending standards may lead to financial instability in the financial system, or a debt crisis when interest rates rise. The peak irony for this debate, though, is the Commonwealth Treasury's submission to the royal commission into banks. This is not what the government might call a 'do-gooder organisation', worried about vulnerable people. It's not financial counsellors. It's not Labor MPs sticking up for consumers. It's the Commonwealth Treasury's own submission, made less than three years ago, made in 2018, to the government's own royal commission. That submission noted that the responsible lending laws enhanced, rather than detracted, from macroeconomic outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll just read a few quotes from the other experts. Eliza Wu, who is an associate professor of finance at The University of Sydney, said these reforms could 'sow the seeds of the next housing boom and the next debt crisis'. Karen Cox, the CEO of the Financial Rights Legal Centre, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Watering down credit protections will leave individuals and families at severe risk of being pushed into credit arrangements that will hurt in the long term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, as I said, the Treasury's own submission, the government's own economic advisor, said the laws enhance rather than detract from economic outcomes. You've got consumer groups, you've got financial counsellors, you've got vulnerable Australians, you've got academics and you've even got the Treasury saying: 'This is a dumb thing to do, government. Don't do this. You don't need to do this.' Why are you doing this? Because you've invented a fake credit squeeze when all the data is pointed in the other direction. There's no problem getting credit in this country. There's no evidence that the government have put forward. They're just doing the bidding of the big banks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a couple more points I'd like to make. Even when you look at the regime they're putting in, it's downright confusing and inefficient. Under the proposed changes, lending decisions will be regulated by APRA for authorised deposit-taking institutions—banks—using their existing power to set prudential standards. What does that actually mean? Well, it means that APRA's current lending standards focus on prudential protections—that is, ensuring that the banks don't make lending decisions that destabilise the banking or financial system. That's what APRA does. That's their job. It's an important job. But APRA doesn't worry about consumers. That's not their job. Their job is to worry about the stability of the financial system. Yet the government's placing all their hopes and dreams—the idea that somehow vulnerable Australians will be protected from predatory lending—on APRA. But it's not a job that they have to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the new rules, under the government's proposals—I hope these die in the Senate—consumer lending will be regulated by three separate sets of rules and two different regulators, depending on the nature of the credit provider and the credit contract. They're taking a simple, proven, effective system that was recommendation 1 of the royal commission—'do not change these laws'—and replacing it with a mishmash to suit their mates in the big banks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A very final thing I'll say: I was listening to the previous speaker in this debate, and I've heard it in the government's talking points—it's about small business apparently. Is it? They're scrapping the dominant-purpose test. The current rules say that if you go to the bank and say, 'I want a loan; it's a little bit for me personally and a little bit for the small business', you have to pass the dominant-purpose test, and the dominant purpose of the loan is what it will be regulated by. But the government's going to get rid of that. Well, I say our travel entitlements are governed by the dominant-purpose test. If we're going somewhere that's predominantly for work, that's the standard we are held to and the standard we hold ourselves to. If it's good enough for us, why is it not good enough in this situation, when it's stood the test of time in consumer credit regulation? The government's on the wrong track with this. I hope they see sense and change their mind—or, if not, that this bill just dies in the Senate, as it should.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:01</span>):  The government are yet to find a bank or a loan shark that they don't want to help or one that, when it puts its hand out, they don't want to lift up. It's a pity they won't do the same for consumers, customers and vulnerable Australians. I think it's now been almost four years and nine or 10 months—the member for Macquarie might be able to help me out here—since I arrived in this chamber, and I think probably from the second week of parliament when I was sworn in I have been talking about protections for people who are being ripped off by the loan shark industry or by banks in this country. Many people on this side of the chamber are starting to sound—although I hate to use a cliche in a debate—like broken records. But I fear that the record player has completely broken, because this government has gone down the path of a lack of respect and a lack of any protections for Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even during a pandemic, in legislation before the House today the government is asking the Parliament of Australia to remove responsible lending obligations for a majority of consumer contracts. During a global pandemic, during a national recession and with rising unemployment—a million Australians unemployed, record household debt, terms that are crippling businesses in this country—why would the government want to put people on the scrap heap even further? That's exactly what I believe these laws will do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Responsible lending obligations were part of the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009, which was introduced by the Labor government, partly in response to the global financial crisis. Responsible lending obligations require credit card providers to make reasonable inquiries about a customer and assess whether a credit product will be unsuitable for them. These are commonsense, practical laws that have served our country well. Responsible lending obligations apply only to consumer credit contracts, not commercial credit contracts—for example, small business lending. As we know, that is another jurisdiction. But the remainder of the bill relates to small amount credit contracts and response to the independent 2016 review of the small amount credit contract laws, which I will focus on a little in my remarks. I know the member for Lalor will be champing at the bit to talk about this in today's debate, just as she has every week, it seems, that this parliament has sat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the bill has been discussed quite widely in the media, not because of anything the government's done or any advice or information that the Treasurer has delivered to the people of Australia. I add that not even the banks have requested this. Let's put that on the record. This is not something the Banking Association or the big four have issued public statements about or have written to the Treasurer about, demanding that the Prime Minister take action. I won't speak for the major lending facilities in this country, but I reckon if I were one of them I'd be scratching my head and saying: 'What on earth is the Treasurer on about? We didn't ask for this. We have enough to deal with as far as I'm concerned.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week, we saw 23,000 Australians call for responsible lending laws to be strengthened, not removed. In the lead-up to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry, which hosted hearings in Canberra last Friday, which I carefully looked at and followed, we saw more than 23,000 individuals sign a letter to every Australian parliamentarian demanding protections be maintained. The request, as organised by consumer advocacy group Choice, is backed by 125 charities, unions, academics and financial counsellors. Let's put that in perspective: the banks and the Banking Association didn't call for these reforms and 125 charities, financial institutions, financial counsellors and leading consumer advocates didn't ask for these reforms. So I've got a really simple question for the government: Who did? Who came up with this idea? Who possibly thought it was a sane or sensible move to put this into legislation?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These checks and processes that banks and lenders have to abide by when offering consumers loans are critical to ensuring that consumers are protected. The aim is to lend only to those who are in a position to repay debt, rather than see repayments missed and interest and fees incurred, leaving the borrower facing greater financial hardship. As I said, these laws were introduced in 2009 under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act in response to shoddy lending practices which we saw during the global financial crisis. Watering down unfair lending restrictions is unacceptable now and in the future. The government knows doing this will expose people to significant financial harm. The profit is not worth the pain. Without responsible lending obligations in place, a bank could send a pre-approved $5,000 limit credit card to a person in my electorate of Oxley whose only income is a disability pension. The bank could do this even when they know that the person's income is not enough to service a loan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will leave vulnerable people in our communities open for attack. It will hurt young people, elderly people, people on the disability support pension, people in abusive relationships, Indigenous Australians and people of non-English-speaking backgrounds. Now, of all times, we need to be looking after people, not harming them. As we heard from the Financial Rights Legal Centre in their submission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our Government wants free-flowing credit to reign at a time when unprecedented numbers of Australians have had to ask for loan deferrals amidst COVID-19. It simply defies logic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last thing people need is inappropriate and unaffordable credit. This is another example of the government's COVID-19 recovery strategy leaving people behind. It's happy for businesses and banks to thrive at the expense of vulnerable Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn in my remarks to the regulation legislative instruments set by the Treasurer and enforced by ASIC. These are the non-ADI-lender regulations, which I believe are poorly thought out. Consumer lending will be regulated by three separate sets of rules and two different regulators, depending on the nature of the credit provider and the contract. I want to know: why are we making this even more complicated? Why disconnect regulators and make it harder for safeguards to be enforced?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is another example of the government directly going against recommendations from the royal commission. Treasury's own submission to the banking royal commission noted that the responsible lending laws are better for the economy. That's not Labor saying that. That's not the charities, the academics and the financial counsellors saying that. We've now got Treasury's own submission saying that the responsible lending laws are better for the economy. We need to put our efforts into advancing legislation that ensures the economy is, as the government like to say, built back stronger after COVID-19, so why are the government trying to get in the road of that?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I refer now to some remarks about the irresponsible changes to the small-amount credit contracts law. The bill contains changes to laws governing small-amount credit contracts and consumer leases: a cap on payments for small-amount credit contracts and consumer leases at 20 per cent of a consumer's income, which is separate for SACCs or consumer leases, or at 10 per cent of a consumer's income; setting the maximum cost of four per cent per month for CRNs; requiring that payments be equally spread over the course of a loan; and prohibiting providers from charging monthly fees in relation to the residential term of a loan when it's paid out early. There are problems with these. Some of these details are incorporated in the draft regulations rather than the primary legislation, but the biggest concern I have is that these changes were the government's response to the independent small-amount credit contract review commissioned in 2016 by then minister Kelly O'Dwyer. Once again they fall short of actually what was recommended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A member of the government came up to me and said: 'You must be happy we're dealing with the SACC reforms. You've been talking about this a lot, Milton.' I said: 'You've got part of the equation right; I have been talking about this non-stop for about four years and 10 months, but it doesn't do what your own reform said. It doesn't do what Minister O'Dwyer recommended. It doesn't actually deliver the legislation that the now Deputy Prime Minister, Mr McCormack, promised when he delivered the explanatory memorandum to this House. It doesn't do that. It waters it down.' I'm not going to give any credit to the government for watering down their own legislation and their own proposals that their recommendation said they would deliver.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All credit to former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull—and that is not a name you hear from those opposite any day of the week. He wrote to me in July 2019 and said, 'After a long wait, the exact legislation you've been calling for will be introduced.' The only problem is that the now Prime Minister and Minister Dutton decided to see him off as Prime Minister. So we're seeing a shortfall of the recommendations that were actually promised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The law this government is proposing doubles the debt repayment cap for people whose income is not predominantly from Centrelink. This bill makes it perfectly legal for people to be charged up to 40 per cent of their monthly income to pay back lending fees. In the Oxley electorate the average household income per month is $3,660. If a family spends 40 per cent of that income on debt repayments, that brings their funds down to $1,464 per month to pay their rent, to pay bills, to get school supplies for kids and to put food on the table. The fact that this government are even entertaining those changes shows once again that they are not on the side of working families; they are simply on the side of big business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The SACC review recommended that fees for consumer leases be capped at four per cent of the retail price of a leased good. The proposed law allows for four per cent of fees to be calculated on the price plus delivery and installation fees, plus establishment fees of 20 per cent on top of that cost cap. This means that consumers could be paying equivalent annual interest rates of over 100 per cent. As we know, the devil is always in the detail when it comes to the fine print of this legislation that the government is trying to ram through the parliament today. This fine print will, I believe, have devastating impacts on people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet again this government has put forward a bill that doesn't make sense. Under this bill it's easier for banks to saddle working Australians with debt—debt that the banks didn't even ask the government to deliver. It will be harder for those Australians to get out of debt. It will be leaving people behind at a time when we should be building confidence and supporting consumers to grow the economy. This bill appears to be a shameless move by the government to give a big free kick to the banks at the expense of ordinary people. The government, we know, has ignored the first recommendation of the banking royal commission. The very first recommendation has been ignored and blown apart by this government, proving once again that this government can't be trusted to do the right thing by Australians and regulate the financial sector properly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has enormous consequences for vulnerable and working Australians. It has consequences for the community groups and advocates that I have been working with over the last couple of years to give justice to the people who just want a fair go. It has consequences for the businesses that have been ripped off by the loan sharks in the financial sector. It has consequences for the pensioners and their advocates who have been out there trying to get their money back and make sense of the contracts that they've signed. We're simply asking for a fair go for people who need support. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill waters down the lending provisions. It puts vulnerable Australians entering into contracts at risk—and I use those words 'at risk' strongly. It's not good enough for the government to simply say, 'Well, it's a piece of legislation that we've been working on for a while,' without any due explanation. As I said, the Treasurer of Australia can't explain why these laws are required. The members of the government can't explain why these laws are required. Last week, we saw 23,000 Australians, including financial counsellors and people from the non-profit sector, voice their concerns. I know from speaking to them firsthand how fearful they are of this legislation. I simply ask the government to rethink this strategy. Rethink what you're doing. Think of those Australians who need the financial sector to be on their side.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:16</span>):  I'm pleased to make a contribution to the debate about the legislation before us today, the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Supporting Economic Recovery) Bill 2020. I'm also pleased to follow my friend the member for Oxley. I say 'friend', but he's also a great colleague, and we have lots of things in common, not least of which has been our advocacy in the space of payday lenders and the damage they're doing in communities across this country. The legislation before us does two things: it removes the responsible lending obligations from the banking sector, and it seeks to implement changes in the space of payday lending. We call them 'small amount credit contracts', but, for those tuning in at home, these are the payday lenders and loan sharks that you've heard me speak about many times. The government want some credit today for implementing changes in the payday lending space. The problem is that they had their own review into this in 2016 and what's before us today has failed to put in place the recommendations of that review, so they're not even listening to themselves or addressing what they uncovered in their own review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will do something, but not enough, to protect people in my community and in communities across this country who are preyed upon by businesses to buy debt and pay it back at exorbitant rates. To get to the nub of the matter, the recommendation from the review was that 10 per cent of someone's income should be the upper limit of what they could be required to pay back. The government have ignored that recommendation and taken that limit up to 20 per cent. They've flagrantly ignored their own recommendations, after waiting four years, since 2016, to bring in any new regulation in this space, and this is despite them recognising the need for it. The other thing this legislation does is ignore the first recommendation of the Hayne royal commission into financial services, which was: do not undo the responsible lending laws, which were implemented after the global financial crisis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many here, I know that when I was first elected I sat with victims who eventually gave evidence to the banking royal commission and I heard their harrowing stories—they were absolutely harrowing stories. I want to put on record today how disappointed I am that they've been ignored. I also want to make the point that part of this legislation has no friends. The legislation before us has no friends. The big banks haven't asked for this and the community legal centres have been at pains to explain to us why this will be a disaster for vulnerable people in our communities, and even for the not-so-vulnerable people in our communities. The Consumer Action Law Centre in Melbourne and my own community legal centre, WEstjustice, have met with me time and time again around this. Financial Counselling Australia wrote to us and outlined what they perceive to be problems with this legislation. I've even heard from my local mortgage brokers; they don't like this piece of legislation either. And the academics don't like it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it has no friends, but here we are in this parliament, under the cover of COVID, undoing something under the banner—looking at the name of this legislation—of the National Consumer Credit Protection Act. What we're doing in this chamber today is opposing the government for undermining and taking away consumer protection. I've been listening, as have my colleagues, to those opposite, and I was particularly perturbed to listen to the member for Longman, who spoke about the battling Australian communities that he represents in this place. He went on and on about a supposed impossibility, because of the recession, for people to get credit. Let me tell him what the outcome of this will be: there are people in my community who, while the responsible-lending laws are in place, are now working with community legal centres in trying to weave their way out of debt and trying to get the banks in this country to act responsibly under the existing law. And the member for Longman is going to allow that to be removed, leaving these people with less capacity to weave their way out of the problems they have got themselves into because institutions have been too quick to give them credit when they didn't have the capacity to repay it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's one case that I know of locally which I think is worth considering in this space. This is a couple who have a mortgage with one major bank, and they then have four separate loans across the four banks. This is under the current legislation, which says that the banks shouldn't lend if there isn't a demonstrable way to pay it back. This family couldn't possibly pay back all of those loans on their income. That was pre COVID—they couldn't possibly do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me just be really clear for the folk listening at home: working in schools for most of my adult life, I know what this kind of financial stress does to families. I know the chaos that this kind of financial stress brings into kitchens. I know the pressure it puts on children who are living in that chaos, who are getting up in the morning and going into the kitchen to find a stressed-out parent sitting at the kitchen table with 17 bills in front of them and wondering: 'How am I going to get through this week? Which bill should I pay first?' This legislation is going to make that happen in homes in my community. This legislation is going to enable the banks to give loans to people who cannot afford to pay them back, with full knowledge of what that's going to do to families. It's going to mean that there are children sitting in classrooms who have come from a chaotic morning where parents have been yelling at one another because they're stressed out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Financial stress has emotional consequences, and those emotional consequences are felt by children around this country. Do you want to do us all a favour? Go back and give this some more thought. Nobody thinks this is a good idea. Nobody thinks that allowing the banks to give credit to individuals when they cannot afford to pay it back is a good idea. Nobody does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know what the impact of this legislation will be. For those members opposite who somehow think that this about credit for business, that's not what this is about. This is about credit for individuals. This is about people being able to take out loans to get through this week but, beyond this week, only driving themselves down into a debt cycle. The impacts will be very real, and the government are being incredibly irresponsible to even think about bringing this into the parliament. They're ignoring the royal commission. We know they voted against it 26 times. We know they didn't want to hear. We know they didn't want to sit with the victims of the banks through that period. But to have them actually undermine recommendation 1 is appalling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the outcomes of the royal commission's recommendations, I sat with mortgage brokers in my community and I listened to their concerns about some of those recommendations. I just want to share with the House a mortgage broker's response to this. He's written to me to say that he's obliged to put the customer's interests first but this legislation will mean the banks don't have to. They won't be held to the same standard as a mortgage broker.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have countless examples given to us by Financial Counselling Australia and others who work with people to try and undo this harm, to try and find a way through. They think that the responsible lending laws should stay. They believe the laws protect consumers. They use the laws to help their clients. They predict they will see more clients with unaffordable debt if these laws are scrapped—in other words, if this legislation goes through this parliament. They believe scrapping the laws will hinder the economic recovery from COVID-19. They're very concerned about the impact of repealing the responsible lending laws on their clients and on the broader community, and they believe such a move will be harmful to individuals, families and the public. And they're tired. They're tired of working with people who are being preyed upon in both spaces here: in the credit space and in the payday lending space. They're incredibly disappointed that the payday lending recommendations will not be fully implemented by this legislation—the recommendations, as we've said, that the government itself put forward—and they're absolutely disappointed that this government would be acting under cover of COVID to undo laws that were designed to protect people in our communities, at a time when people are under enormous financial stress anyway, as well as suffering anxiety about their futures.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, from this government, what we're seeing is layer upon layer upon layer. 'We want to make workers less secure in their jobs.' That's what this government is doing in this place this week. 'Then we want to be able to give them credit they can't afford to repay.' It leaves me wondering which planet those opposite live on. Do they live in the same Australia as those of us on this side do? Do they sit at tables in their electorate offices, speak to real people on the ground and hear the impacts that their ideology has in real homes, on real people? Do they understand that the laws we make in this place have very real impacts in the community?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This piece of legislation is absolutely reprehensible. It flies in the face of logic. Most importantly, it flies in the face of the government's own recommendations around payday lenders and loan sharks, and it flies in the face of a royal commission—the first recommendation from a royal commission. It is really difficult to walk back into this chamber day in, day out and watch this government pass legislation that is actually going to mean real harm to the people in the communities that I represent.</span>

Those of us who are old enough have happy memories of Matilda the kangaroo, with that wink, emerging into the stadium at the 1982 Commonwealth Games, which is still thought of as one of the best ever Commonwealth Games. Of course, there is strong competition for that title from the 2018 Commonwealth Games held on the Gold Coast. What that adds up to is emphatic proof that Queensland is perfectly placed to handle the even bigger undertaking that is the Olympics.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It will be good for Queensland and good for Australia. It will create jobs and the acceleration of infrastructure development. It will provide a boost to trade, tourism and our economy. I know the difference that the 2000 Olympics made to Sydney, and of course Melbourne hosted our first ever games in 1956. Just as the world came to Sydney at the beginning of this century, it will hopefully and rightly come to Queensland. It would be magical. Can I make a suggestion to Premier Palaszczuk: get on the phone to Roy and HG and lock them in, because that would make it absolutely perfect, and bring back the wombat.</span>

Ruth and Kylie wrote to me to express their thanks to the Morrison government for the JobKeeper program, because without it they might have had to close their doors for good. They said they lost many donors, which could have been devastating, and the consequences to the program would have been dire. They wrote: 'JobKeeper enables us to maintain our employees and more than 60 volunteers. We were given hope and took heart that we were not only able to survive, as an organisation, but indeed we were able to thrive.' Hope Reins changes lives, and JobKeeper has helped them and 5,900 small businesses in Wide Bay through these very troubled times.</span>

This is an incredibly exciting development. Of course there are still hurdles to jump and there is still further to go, but a successful Olympic bid for South-East Queensland means more jobs and more opportunities for more Australians, not just in the south-east corner of our state but right throughout regional Queensland and right throughout Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not hard to imagine the benefits, in terms of jobs, opportunities, infrastructure and trade, and the reputational benefits, like that which we got from the successful games in 2000 and 1956. All of this is before us in the event that this bid is successful. The state government says the Olympic Games will bring something like 130,000 additional jobs to our state and more than $20 billion into the economy, $10 billion for regional areas and $8.6 billion in trade opportunities. This is an extraordinary opportunity. We welcome it and we congratulate the IOC, the state government, the involvement by the feds, the local governments, the South-East Queensland Council of Mayors and others. Well done. Let's win this, and let's win the jobs and opportunities that come with it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank Leslie Freedman from EndoActive, Donna Ciccia from Endometriosis Australia, Jess Taylor and Melissa Parker from QENDO and Dr Susan Evans and Kirsty Mead from the Pelvic Pain Foundation of Australia for the incredible work they're doing to educate women, their families and the medical profession about what endo is, what to do if you have it and, most importantly, where to go for support. I would encourage everyone here or watching out at home to check out their websites for more information on endometriosis. The member for Bendigo and I also met with Dr Karen Price, who is the president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. We're really looking forward to working with Dr Price and her members this year on endo.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You'll be hearing a lot more from me and the member for Bendigo on endo this year, especially during March, which is Endometriosis Awareness Month. There will be a lot of activities around Australia and the chance to help us spread the word about things like the brand-new RANZCOG RATE—the Raising Awareness Tool for Endometriosis. It helps women and their doctors to identify symptoms which might point to endo.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  I want to congratulate everyone who lobbied hard so that South-East Queensland would be the preferred candidate for the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic bids. We have work to do, but this would be fantastic for South-East Queensland, where one in seven people in this country live. It means 130,000 direct jobs and hundreds of thousands of indirect jobs, and in the regions. This is a great opportunity for South-East Queensland and I call on all levels of government to fund infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For regional Queensland this would be really important. I think of the Bruce Highway, the Cunningham Highway and the Warrego Highway. These are important connectors into South-East Queensland, so it's very important that all levels of government get behind these. Also, as the Premier said today, we would see sporting events held in the regions. She specifically mentioned Ipswich and football, and I'm looking forward to our football being played at the North Ipswich Reserve. I think this is a great opportunity for all levels of government to fund the North Ipswich Reserve upgrade. It would help with an A-League licence bid by the Western Pride, and the new Brisbane Jets consortium, which I hope gets the NRL bid later this year, would also be involved in this. It would also provide tremendous support for sport in Ipswich.</span>

Not only has it got $8½ million in the pipeline for the Brig O'Johnson Bridge and $13 million to upgrade Clarence Town Road, there are now 13 more projects funded out of the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program. There's $575,000 for the region's towns and villages. Steve Lowe, one of the local councillors, was thrilled to hear that Clarence Town would benefit from these, with shade cover at the Lions Park and the School of Arts, as well as park and recreation upgrades to Bridge Reserve and the Clarence Town Village Green.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paterson's John Tucker Park will receive extra funding for playground shade and access paths, and the Paterson School of Arts will also benefit from accessibility upgrades. The 99-year-old charming Martins Creek School of Arts will also receive funding for an upgrade to improve access. In Dungog, we will fund park and recreation upgrades to the Lions Park, Jubilee Park and Coronation Park. This includes new play equipment, paths, seating and shade. Dungog Library will also benefit from stage 1 improvements, including entries and accessibility. Dungog Memorial Swimming Pool will also receive new shade shelter over the kids' pool.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  As co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of the Olympic Movement in Australia, along with the member for Forde, it's wonderful news today to see Brisbane and the region chosen as the preferred city for the 2032 Olympic Games. That's great news for South-East Queensland and great news for my electorate of Moreton, where we already have a world-class sporting facilities like the Queensland State Netball Centre, which we could dodgy up for basketball; the Queensland Sports and Athletics Centre, with two international-standard running tracks; and the Queensland Tennis Centre, with the Pat Rafter Arena.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be wonderful to have the Olympic Games right in our very own backyard. But even more exciting is the economic boom that these games will bring to South-East Queensland, along with improved infrastructure. There would be 130,000 jobs created and, for the residents of Moreton, transport infrastructure will finally see shovels in the ground for the Coopers Plains crossing upgrade, which will be crucial for trains shuffling visitors between Brisbane and the Gold Coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being host city to the Olympic Games is another reason that the 11 million truck movements a year expected through Moreton's suburbs when the Inland Rail terminates at Acacia Ridge, 36 kilometres from the port, are just not viable. Hosting an international sporting event while coal trains and trucks are belting around our suburbs and creating noise and air pollution is just not viable. I've said it before and I'll say it again: the Inland Rail should be bypassing Brisbane and going straight to the port of Gladstone. Everald Compton's original plan should be revisited.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk. It's a great achievement to be named the preferred Olympic City for 2032, and I look forward to all governments working together. </span>

The local economy of Joondalup is reliant on access to the vast commercial and industrial areas in neighbouring Wanneroo. There is a compelling requirement to upgrade both Flynn Drive and Neaves Road without further delay, providing an efficient east-west link between the Perth-Darwin National Highway and the Mitchell Freeway. This investment will also better connect Neerabup with future economic and employment estates proposed at Nowergup and Pinjar. </span>

The Whiteman-Yanchep Highway will connect to Flynn Drive and Neaves Road. The construction of this missing link will complete an important east-west freight corridor. Further to the south, the Whiteman-Yanchep Highway will connect with Gnangara Road. Gnangara Road needs to be upgraded from Alexander Drive to the new Perth-Darwin National Highway, improving access for businesses based in the existing Landsdale, Wangara and Enterprise Park industrial estates.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  The year 2021 is already shaping up to be a year of female empowerment, and we need to go further. In two months, we've seen strong calls for paid parental leave and for a pink budget in May from the government; we've seen the work practices of our highest office in the land being laid bare to expose the appalling treatment of staffers, particularly women, in Parliament House; and we've seen brave women, such as Brittany Higgins, daring to speak up and breaking the code of silence in a patriarchal system that is deliberately geared, in this place, towards men. We also have Australia preparing to host the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2023. So we've made some gains, but there's a long way to go. Of the seven decision-makers for this year's budget, only one is a woman. There are 23 members of federal cabinet, and only seven are women. And only one in five community soccer clubs has women's change rooms. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On International Women's Day on 8 March, the theme is 'Choose to Challenge'. I challenge you all to challenge assumptions, challenge the establishment and challenge yourself, because from challenge can only come change. I'm well placed to know that. One of the best things that I experience as the member of parliament for Warringah is when I visit our local schools and I see how inspired the young girls and boys are and how excited they are at the idea that they can be trailblazers and that they can set big goals, have big dreams and go after them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  I want to address the Queensland government's continued unwillingness to provide details of the Premier's COVID camp plan at Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport. A month ago, the Queensland Premier first floated the idea, and, yesterday, a representative of the Deputy Premier's office confirmed that the state government had not supplied basic details of its plan to the federal government. It's over a month on, and there are still no details, despite repeated requests from the Prime Minister's office, Commonwealth officials, my office and the Toowoomba region community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Premier stated that the camp would be run by the state government; her deputy said it would be run by the federal government. Which is it? The lack of a detailed plan is causing fear and anxiety in our community, and, every day, I receive more emails and phone calls from the community, from business leaders and from health workers who are frustrated at the lack of detail. I don't blame them. They're trying to be reasonable, but, without these details, how can they be confident in the Premier's plan? The Toowoomba region desperately wants to resolve this issue, and I humbly offer the Premier a solution. It's a simple one: show us the plan. The Premier says the details are there; her deputy says they aren't. Premier, make the details public so we can see for ourselves. This has caused significant fear and concern in the community, and we'd like to resolve this issue as quickly as we can. Premier, this is your proposal; show us your plan.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  Today is an exciting day to be a Queenslander. At 2 am this morning, Queensland time, the International Olympic Committee's Future Host Summer Commission designated Brisbane as the preferred host for the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic games, a decision that was endorsed unanimously by the IOC's executive board. This brings us one step closer to a history-making Brisbane 2032 Olympic Games. Australian athletes have historically achieved their best Olympics results at Australian games, but this isn't just a win for them; it's a win for Queensland. The Queensland state government's analysis has shown that a 2032 Olympics could turbocharge our economy, with tourism, new jobs and infrastructure projects right across the state. It's thanks to the strong leadership of Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk through the COVID-19 pandemic that the Sunshine State was able to host some of the biggest sporting events happening anywhere in the world in 2020, and a 2032 Olympic Games on Australian soil will boost confidence right across the globe that our country is the new international travel destination—safe, exciting and ready to welcome visitors with open arms. We haven't crossed the finish-line yet, but I'm proud to say that Brisbane is going for gold in 2032.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  Duke Kahanamoku was a Hawaiian Olympic swimmer and a keen surfer, and it is said he had a smile so wide that it won over the hearts of all Australians when he visited in 1914. Upon his visit, he held a surfing exhibition at Freshwater Beach on Christmas Eve. It won't surprise the House to hear surfing is quite popular on the Northern Beaches. In my younger years I was more into rowing than surfing. However, it is something that I always wish I had taken up. Thankfully, I have a daughter who is beginning to pick up the board and give it a go, and she drags me along just to teach me some humility.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The culture of surfing on the beaches is so profound there is a statue in honour of Duke Kahanamoku at Freshwater. Overlooking the beach, it is at a perfect spot for the person who brought surfing to Australia via the Northern Beaches. Regrettably, over the years it has been left to nature's course. Trees and shrubs have grown over the path, and general wear and tear have obscured what is an important historical site, because, whether you live in Avalon or Freshwater, Manly or Narrabeen, the ocean, the waves and the salt are in your DNA. We must preserve our local history, we must honour it and we must restore this site to its former grandeur so its glory can shine like a light upon a hill for surfing, for the beaches, for the people of the Northern Beaches and for all the people who love surfing in this country.</span>

He doesn't hold a hose, mate! And, when it comes to keeping Australians safe, he simply leaves it to others. He's dodged his quarantine duties, and it has fallen to the states to pick up the slack. In my state of Queensland, the Palaszczuk Labor government have been doing just that. They've been managing quarantine, and they've even partnered with Wagners to develop a proposal for a national quarantine centre at the Wellcamp Airport at Toowoomba. It would accommodate up to 1,000 returning Australians currently stranded overseas, plus 300 staff. The Morrison government has failed to act on the proposal.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  I've spoken about the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program before, because it's such a good program. The Morrison government announced it on 22 May 2020. In the 2020-21 budget the Morrison government announced a $1 billion extension to that program, following strong community and local government support. This program supports local councils to deliver priority local road and community infrastructure projects across Australia, supporting jobs and the resilience of local economies to help communities bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Swan, the City of South Perth is using some of this funding to upgrade the Morris Mundy Reserve in Kensington, where I spent a fair bit of time watching my son play not only cricket but also football before he went on to play for Port Adelaide in the AFL. The upgrade work involves repurposing the existing quarter court and the construction of a new, larger multipurpose court. The new court caters for a variety of games that can be played by small groups of people. It will have basketball and netball rings as well as space for ball-shooting practice and games, including three-on-three basketball. The smaller existing court will be retained and repurposed for table tennis; two outdoor table tennis tables will be installed on the existing quarter court. The works are expected to take three months. It is another fine example of the Morrison government's commitment to the people of Swan and the people of Australia by providing local infrastructure projects.</span>

Running since 1951, the Blake Prize, named for William Blake, the famous 18th century artist and poet, threads religious images with the artistic. The prize encourages contemporary artists of various styles to tackle the nature of faith, spirituality, religion, humanity and belief. This year's prize attracted a record number of entries, no doubt due to the many hours that artists, like many of us, spent over the previous year pondering life's big questions. Casula and Werriwa are ideally positioned to host the prestigious art prize. We have a community made up of 150 different birthplaces, 140 languages and an equally diverse range of faiths.</span>

The Established Artist Residency went to Zanny Begg for her work <span style="font-style:italic;">Stories of Kannagi</span>. Eddie Abd took out the Emerging Artist Prize for her work <span style="font-style:italic;">In Their Finest</span>. The big one, the $35,000 Blake Prize, was awarded to Leyla Stevens for her artwork <span style="font-style:italic;">Kidung/Lament</span>, a truly amazing artwork. The exhibition runs until 11 April. I encourage everyone to get along.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  The Urannah Dam will create more than 1,800 jobs and transform the Whitsundays-Bowen-Collinsville region and the Mackay region, but it is under threat from the extreme Greens and their newly appointed paid activists. The word 'extreme' needs to be taken literally, because Annabel Deane, their paid activist, has a Facebook profile with the slogan 'Eff Australia Day and eff colonisation'. She has campaigned against jobs at the Carmichael mine and rail site, and now she has turned her attentions to the Urannah Dam.</span>

The fact is that the Urannah Dam has the highest benefit-cost ratio of any proposed dam in the country. What it amounts to is that for every dollar the government spends, the taxpayer will get $2 in return.</span>

This time it's a yellow headed snapping turtle which breathes through its bottom. That should be an emblem for the Greens, because they talk out of theirs! Our research indicates that this turtle has been found in a number of creeks and rivers as far away as near Townsville, not just at the site of the dam.</span>

They've got no tolerance for paid extreme Greens activists who are out there to destroy local jobs, destroy opportunities for the north and destroy opportunities for new farming. I've got to say, as the member for Dawson I am very proud to be a fighter for local jobs in my region and projects that will create local jobs. I will not let the Greens destroy this dam.</span>

Notwithstanding the rejection, Julian Assange remains in Belmarsh Prison in what I understand are dreadful conditions that would very likely not meet human rights standards. Assange is reportedly in poor health. He has effectively been in detention for the past decade. He is accused of having accessed and published classified US documents. Chelsea Manning, the US soldier who provided the documents to Assange and who was convicted, had her sentence commuted by the US president in 2017.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The documents exposed US war crimes. There is a groundswell of opinion across the world, from eminent legal professionals, prominent civic leaders and human rights groups, including Amnesty International, that the pursuit of Julian Assange is politically motivated and that he should be released. This matter has dragged on for long enough. Julian Assange is an Australian citizen. If his health is so fragile that he should not be extradited to the US, then nor should he continue to languish inside Belmarsh prison. It is time that Julian Assange was set free.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  I want to do something unusual. I want to congratulate the Leader of the Opposition. Like many members, I congratulated Joseph Biden on becoming the President of the United States. Though I think Australia should decide its laws for Australians, unlike others, it's nonetheless welcome to see the successful and peaceful transfer of power. I know that the Leader of the Opposition, in his congratulations, was also warm, and he said, 'Labor's position on climate change shares much with that of the Biden team.' They're his words, not mine. It's a welcome statement, but the question is whether the Leader of the Opposition actually read the Biden plan on energy. After all, those opposite never understood their plan on the retiree tax. But, as usual, I have saved him the effort. 'The Biden-Harris clean energy revolution embraces technologies to cut emissions through all low- and zero-carbon technologies,' with emphasis on the word 'all'. It goes on to say that Biden will support a research agenda to look at nuclear power, including small modular nuclear reactors. I welcome the Leader of the Opposition's recent embrace of nuclear power. You're not committed to cutting global greenhouse gas emissions if you rule technologies out because you're a battleaxe left over from the sixties. So congratulations to the Leader of the Opposition for his embrace of nuclear power. Hopefully he can educate the member for Macnamara.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  In this country, the average number of vehicles thefts per 100,000 people is about 19, but if you're from Queensland that is number is 52.4. The youth justice system is under stress, and it's not good enough for this chamber, for Canberra, to say, 'It's not our business.' Youth justice is everyone's business because we're all victims of a poorly-run youth justice system. It's under-resourced and overstressed, with crowded courts and a lack of wraparound services. Youth are on drugs as early as the age of 10. We've got to get serious about 10- to 14-year-olds. The Commonwealth plays a role the minute the welfare system begins its work in their welfare journey, from the age of 16.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community was numbed and horrified by the events of Australia Day, when we lost Kate, Matt and little Miles. We want something done. The community came together in a city-wide conversation and came up with good ideas for state and federal ministers, because what we're doing now is not working. We must be open-minded. The high-tide mark of political will was found in the Queensland parliament yesterday, when they refused to consider breach of bail as being an offence. If it's not an offence then why adhere to the conditions of bail? We have a Queensland government refusing to contemplate that policy. There are many great ideas here, federal and state. Let's unify levels of government and sides of the chamber and make some progress on youth justice, for the sake of families that suffer for decades because of poorly managed drug policy in this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  The message that Labor wants to send manufacturing workers is this: we are on your side, particularly today. We're standing up for 150 workers in Portland, Victoria, who are relying on the federal government to save their jobs. They are employed at Keppel Prince, Victoria's only manufacturer of towers for wind turbines. They use Australian steel from BlueScope for the towers, and they should be the perfect candidates to build Vestas' new $360 million Ryan Corner wind farm. Stunningly, Vestas will use cheap, imported steel, potentially costing 150 jobs. More than half of the power from this farm will go to the government's Snowy Hydro scheme. The Morrison government is in a position to mandate local steel in the build, like the AWU and the AMWU are calling for, but it won't. At a time when so many Australian exports have been locked out of China, the idea that Australian jobs will be lost due to the use of cheap<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">, imported steel is staggering. There are three people who could make a difference here: the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, and the Prime Minister. But, as always when there is a problem to be solved, the Morrison government is nowhere to be seen. If the government really backs Aussie manufacturing and Aussie steel, it will use its power to save these jobs. It's the least the government could do for those workers.</span></span>

That is why, soon after becoming Prime Minister, one of my first decisions was to initiate the royal commission into aged care. That was one of many decisions taken by this government, and also prior to my coming into the role of Prime Minister.</span>

This funding will increase to some $27 billion by 2023-24. Under the stewardship of this government—the effective financial stewardship, I should stress—this is, on average, an extra $1.5 billion of support for older Australians every single year over the forward estimates. More money every year, and increasing, because our government understands the fundamental challenges that we face in the aged-care sector, and we also want to know about all the issues that still need to be addressed. When we called the royal commission into aged care we made very clear that we needed to deal with the fundamental failings in the aged-care sector, which have been happening not just recently but over decades. We need to address those fundamental issues as we respond to the royal commission.</span>

There is now a total of 195,597 packages that will be issued by 30 June this year. Between now and 30 June, the number of home-care packages available to senior Australians is increasing by approximately 1,200 per week. We are absolutely determined and committed to addressing the serious issues in our aged-care sector. When I announced the royal commission into aged care, I said it begins with a culture of respect for older Australians. That's what we need in this country, and that is what my government is determined to deliver.</span>

And no-one knows that better than the member for Fairfax, my special envoy, who we sent in to be our advocate and my representative for Brisbane's bid for the 2032 Olympics. But there is more good news for Queensland, because there are now more jobs in Queensland than there were before the pandemic started, under the strong economic management and support that has been provided by the Commonwealth government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, while 728,000 Queenslanders were on JobKeeper when the pandemic was at its peak, by December that number had fallen to 259,000. There were 22,150 new apprentices supported by our wage subsidy program to get new apprentices on the job and on the tools in Queensland, and 24,000 existing apprentices were supported by our existing apprenticeship support program in some 13,000 businesses, keeping some 24,000 existing apprentices on the tools during the pandemic. And 54,000 training places were provided into Queensland, which have already been taken up by 21,000 who have enrolled. This is good news for Queensland, as a result of the policies. And, as the Minister for Housing will know, 19,000 HomeBuilder applications were made in the great state of Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That all comes on top of the good news we've had today. Back in May 2019 our government, during the course of the election, committed $10 million to support the proposal of the South-East Queensland mayors that Queensland and indeed Brisbane should bid for the 2032 Olympics. Soon after the election I was pleased to be in Osaka and to raise the prospect of this bid with the president of the International Olympic Committee, and I was so pleased that by December of that year the Queensland government committed to the bid. I congratulate the Queensland government, and I look forward to continuing to work with the Queensland government and the Australian Olympic Committee as they now lead this process forward.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And I make this reference, and this is very important for all Australians: the Australian Olympic Committee's CEO, Matt Carroll, said today, in recognition of what this means for Australia: 'Australia brings certainty in uncertain times.' That's what this bid means. The rest of the world has looked at Australia, and they've said, 'They know how to get things done; they know how to deal with things.' <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Olympics can bring jobs, it can bring trade, it can bring economic activity to Queensland and it can showcase us to the world yet again. I congratulate particularly the Premier of Queensland, Annastacia Palaszczuk. How good is she in keeping Queenslanders safe! I look forward to working with her for a long time to come.</span>

We are referring, of course, to the issues in relation to the Holy Spirit home in Carseldine, where a doctor failed to complete the training and where the doctor subsequently administered a higher than prescribed dose. A number of steps have occurred. Firstly, the secretary of the department has met with and spoken with the CEO, initially, and also with the chair of the company. I'm advised that the CEO is being stood aside as a consequence of the discussions and in particular that the company is installing new management. They are bringing in additional management. It is a company that has been employed through the course of the pandemic by the Western Australian government and the Victorian government, and in the Northern Territory and New South Wales. It has a long history of employment on that front.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, at the government's request, former Chief Nursing and Midwifery Officer of Australia Deb Thoms has been installed to oversee clinical guidance. In addition, there has been a review of the mandated and required training—which was part of the contract, which the company was in breach of—and it has been confirmed that every person involved with a clinical role with the vaccine has completed the training. That has already been done, it has already been reviewed, and it has already been confirmed by the department. In addition to that, what we are doing is bringing in additional clinical support in New South Wales and Queensland. That has been a direct response under the guidance of Professor Brendan Murphy, who has met with the company. There was a clear breach. It was a breach of the required standards by the individual, and it was a breach by the company, which not only failed to meet its contractual obligation but also, very significantly, provided false advice. As we can see, there are serious consequences, but, above all else, safety procedures have been put in place.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can inform the House that prior to question time, at approximately 1 pm, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer and I spoke with the chief medical officer for the Metro North district in Brisbane, Dr Liz Rushbrook, who is overseeing the clinical care of the two patients in question—the 88-year-old male and the 94-year-old female. Her advice to us is that both have been unaffected and both are in very strong health. There have been no adverse impacts. Indeed, the woman will be returned, at the request of her family, to her facility this afternoon. The male will stay in hospital for a prepared, already predicted elective surgery procedure. So both are in good health.</span>

From the earth to the moon. Members opposite are probably wondering what announcement I'm about to make. The Prime Minister probably is too, for that matter, but stay tuned. Listen up!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The COVID-19 vaccine program began on Monday. We all know that. The rollout of the vaccine is one of the largest logistical exercises undertaken in this nation's history. There are 134 vaccination sites around Australia, and nearly 44 per cent of those are in regional Australia. In conjunction with the states and territories and their health services, we expect there to be more than 1,000 vaccine sites across the country. The initial doses of the vaccine will be available to aged-care and disability-care residents and workers, frontline healthcare workers, and quarantine and border workers. The people eligible for the first round of vaccines who live in regional Australia will not be disadvantaged by their postcode, nor should they be. Everyone who gets the vaccine will be able to get it close to where they live. In the member for Cowper's electorate, the Garden Village nursing home residents and workers in Port Macquarie will begin receiving their vaccine in week 1. The CEO of Garden Village, Craig Wearne, said: 'Residents who call Garden Village home are looking forward to the Pfizer vaccine being rolled out at the facility from Saturday.' And 100-year-old resident Grace Symonds, describing her decision to have the vaccine, said, 'It's a way of helping to fight back.' Good on you, Grace!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is also working with both DHL and Linfox to ensure cold chain storage and supply to all Australians, including in rural and remote locations. I have mentioned Saul Resnick before. He is the CEO of DHL Supply Chain. He said that they have completed—I know you are all waiting for this with bated breath, so listen up—341 delivery consignments of vaccines so far and that the vaccines have travelled 397,782 km around Australia to get to their destinations. That is further than from the moon to the earth. Three cheers for that!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">By road and by air they have delivered 49,655 doses of vaccine intact and within specification. I say, 'Well done,' to DHL, to those frontline medical personnel and to our truckies, who have done a magnificent job right throughout COVID to make deliveries. Whether it's now the vaccine, supplies to supermarkets, face masks or respiratory devices, they've done it. I say, on behalf of the parliament, 'Thank you and well done, Truckies.'</span>

The facility had put on extra staff, but the Commonwealth's private contractor never showed up. How did this happen?

I can inform the House that, as of last evening, 71 aged-care facilities across Australia had received vaccination. I should add that Holy Spirit in Carseldine is continuing the program and are expecting a 96 per cent take-up rate amongst their residents. This is the facility that we referred to before. In Victoria, 17 facilities and 1,181 aged-care residents have been provided with vaccination. These are confirmed in advance with the facilities. If you could provide the details to me, I'd be happy to follow that up. We will make inquiries about that particular facility.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Very interestingly, we have seen the number of facilities continue to increase. The first day was a trial day and there were approximately six. Then we went to over 20. Now we have collectively gone to over 71. Today we're expecting well over 20 facilities, with 1,600 individuals being vaccinated. That's occurring around the country. That's what's actually occurring. The order of facilities will differ—sometimes on the basis of advice of the facility and sometimes on the basis of readjusting one facility due to another—but let us be absolutely clear that we are seeing this being rolled out at facilities around the country. As of last evening, the advice from the department was that there were 71 facilities across the country in the first three days. That's better than I had originally expected over the course of that time, knowing that we were starting and building up and up and up. </span>

Indeed, under the Commonwealth contracts, Victoria has had the highest number of facilities and the highest number of aged-care residents of any state and territory vaccinated so far.</span>

In Germany, farmers own 10 per cent of all renewable energy and everyday people own another 30 per cent. If we had a similar system here, billions of dollars could flow into the pockets of regional Australians. My proposed Australian local power agency, which you and I discussed last week, would achieve this by requiring new large renewable energy projects to offer residents within 30 kilometres the chance to invest in those projects. Does the Prime Minister believe that regional Australians should have a legislated right to invest in renewable energy projects being built in their communities?</span>

I also thank her for her engagement on this issue, not just this year but in the meetings we had last year as well. She knows my keen interest in the path that she's pursuing here and the tangible benefits that can be achieved for local communities and what that could mean for regional communities, not just householders, especially when it comes to investment in renewable energy. Our government is considering the proposal in good faith, as I've said, and we will continue to work through that detail. I note the matter that the member has brought before this House to that end, and we're also considering government's support for community driven renewable energy projects. Part of our plan includes our $50.4 million Regional and Remote Communities Reliability Fund, backing microgrid feasibility studies across Australia to help unlock investment that would better meet the local electricity supply. I know the member for Leichhardt is also very interested in those proposals and in many others around the country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can inform the House that today the Australian economy got another shot in the arm, because capital expenditure is up three per cent in the December quarter—the single largest increase in capital expenditure since March 2012. The ABS are saying that businesses have upgraded their investment intentions off the back of our instant asset write-off. In last year's budget, we announced the most significant investment incentives ever in this country, supporting around $200 billion of investment with the immediate expensing provision and the loss carry-back measures, which Treasury said will help create around 50,000 jobs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the latest proof point in an economic recovery that is well underway here in Australia. We've seen the unemployment rate fall to 6.4 per cent. We've seen business and consumer confidence recover to prepandemic levels. We've seen Australia's AAA credit rating reaffirmed. We've seen around 94 per cent of the 1.3 million Australians who either lost their jobs or saw their working hours reduced to zero at the start of this pandemic now back at work. The Morrison government will continue to provide the economic support that this country needs right to the end of this pandemic. That includes the JobMaker hiring credit, the tax cuts, those investment incentives, bringing forward infrastructure spending as well as pursuing historic, world-leading economic reforms like our changes to the digital platforms with our mandatory media code, which passed the parliament today and which will help create jobs and sustain public interest journalism in this country. Our No. 1 focus is on creating jobs. Australia's performance, the performance of 25 million Australians, has seen us better placed than nearly any country in the world on both the health and the economic fronts.</span>

I also met with Mr Yang, and his story is not a happy one—far from it—and Hungry Panda's conduct as a business has been very, very bad. I absolutely agree. In fact, very recently they were before a committee of inquiry in New South Wales where it was noted that they failed to notify the appropriate authorities of a workplace death. Of course, all of these platforms operating as businesses in Australia are absolutely subject to Australian work health and safety laws as administered by the states, of which system the Commonwealth is a part. So I might just commence this answer by noting that that sort of behaviour from that company is absolutely unacceptable. The fact that it is being pursued in New South Wales, as it should be, needs to be brought to bear. That is a complete breach of Australian health and safety laws.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Listening to Mr Yang's experiences, you could not have anything but a great deal of sympathy. What I was unwilling to say to Mr Yang and to Michael Kaine from the Transport Workers Union is that improving that situation is somehow simple, easy or uncomplicated because, with due respect to the Leader of the Opposition and to the shadow minister for industrial relations, it's just not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that some parallels are borne out, as the Leader of the Opposition noted today, in what happened with the media code this week. We are not cheerleading for gig economy platforms—far from it. They should obey Australian law. The Fair Work Commission has noted in a range of decisions that it is not an employment relationship but, nevertheless, that occupational health and safety laws apply. But the idea that you can simply move that group of people who work inside that part of the digital economy from what has been consistently appraised by the Fair Work Commission to be contracting relationships into employment-type arrangements with employment-type minimum remuneration fixed is just not correct. Anyone who believes that this is uncomplicated and that there are not complications could read the shadow minister's transcripts from today on Sky News. It's not a criticism of the shadow minister. He raised the issues about why this is complicated—the cost to the business of changing the model, the loss of flexibility to the employees and the fact that there would invariably be a large impact on consumer pricing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The process that we went through with the media code went back several years to an ACCC inquiry to fully understand how that market worked, because what we did not want to see was the withdrawal of those businesses from Australia. We want to see those businesses in both competition and safety work fairly.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Cabinet and Minister for Health and Aged Care</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:29</span>):  I want to thank the member for Boothby, not only for her question but also for her cross-party work on the Stillbirth National Action Plan, in particular with Senator Bilyk, to whom we extend our best wishes and the thoughts of all in this House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the pandemic continues abroad, with 11,000 lives lost in the last 24 hours; zero at home here in Australia. Another day of zero cases of community transmission Australia-wide. It is an extraordinary outcome. We've had 28 days this year so far of zero community transmission at a time when there have been over 430,000 cases in the last 24 hours. The pandemic rages across the world. Australia remains an island sanctuary thanks to the work of all Australians across the nation. The international border controls and the declaration today by the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer of a hotspot with regard to Auckland is another part of that. So too is the work in terms of testing, with almost 50,000 tests in the last 24 hours; tracing, which continues to strengthen as there is continuous work in strengthening tracing around the country; and distancing, which even this parliament on this day continues to practice and show as a national example of that continued engagement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then of course there is the work with regard to containment. We are seeing very heartening results on the safety and effectiveness of vaccines from around the world. Public Health Scotland has been able to indicate very high levels of protection against serious illness, hospitalisation and loss of life from both of the vaccines that they have been putting in place, Pfizer and AstraZeneca. The AstraZeneca results in fact are slightly stronger than results for the Pfizer vaccine. I think that's an important message to some in Australia who have taken a contrary view to that which has been put out by the Australian Academy of Science, the World Health Organization or <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Lancet</span> journal, which underlines that importance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, during the course of this week, the rollout has commenced. We've gone from just over 1,600 doses on the first day to just over 6,000 doses on the second day to almost 10,000 doses on the third day. By midday tomorrow we will have today's figures, and what we are seeing is that they are increasing each and every day. Each and every day, we see more and more people. We are seeing Australian health professionals doing an extraordinary job, and we want to thank them for their work. We want to thank all of those who are involved. We want to say to Australians that whilst we are doing well, the next phase has commenced, and that will provide safety and protection for Australians.<span style="font-style:italic;"> (Time expired)</span></span>

I took a decision—I think the right decision at that time—not to advise the Prime Minister, because whilst the briefing from the AFP Commissioner was at a high level, as to process and not detail, nonetheless it was provided to me in my role as the minister in charge of the Australian Federal Police.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were media inquiries to the government on the 12th. My office, as a courtesy, on my advice to my chief of staff, contacted the Prime Minister's chief of staff. There was no operational detail provided, no official—the wording that you used. There was simply a passing of acknowledgement that the AFP had an interest in this matter. Obviously the sensitive investigation unit had made a determination on the 11th, as is the case of normal practice within the AFP. Brittany approached the AFP on 5 February. They made a determination at that point, on the morning of the 11th, that this was a sensitive investigation. On that basis, as the honourable member would be aware, under the guidelines of the Australian Federal Police, there is then an obligation on the police commissioner to advise me, which is what happened in due course.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent NDIS quarterly data demonstrates that we've continued to deliver critical NDIS supports during 2020, which was an extraordinarily difficult year for Australians. Indeed, there are now 430,000 participants in the scheme. Last year, 2020, 93,500 participants were added—that's 250 participants per day during an extraordinarily difficult year. Importantly, 100 per cent of all access decisions were made within 21 days, and, over the last 18 months, the average time it takes for children to enter the scheme has dropped from 42 days to just three days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is ensuring the scheme is delivering a consistent and high-quality experience to many vulnerable Australians. And, as a result of COVID-19, the government has continued to implement a range of temporary measures to support participants and providers whilst continuing to make the scheme simpler, fairer and more consistent. Particularly, there is a strategy to ensure equitable access to people with disability for vaccines. The first program, or area of vaccination, prioritises Australians with disability in residential care settings in recognition of the higher risk that they face. Frontline healthcare workers and staff will also be vaccinated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will also ensure that those with underlying medical conditions and complex health needs are some of the first to receive the vaccination. Indeed, 840 NDIS participants are expected to be offered the vaccine this week across over 200 aged-care and disability accommodation sites. By the end of March, the government aims to have at least four million doses of the vaccine administered and then an accelerated rollout, as the Minister for Health has talked through. As we progress through the year, the government will continue to ensure that participants will have access to any temporary measures that are needed where COVID hotspots are declared. Despite the impacts of the pandemic and all the work that's been done, we'll continue to support participants—as we have done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, in our national life, there have been about 108 cases per 100,000 diagnosed with COVID in the general population. By comparison, there are only 43.4 cases per 100,000 for NDIS participants. That is less than half of the national rate, which is testament to the work of the disability sector, the agency and all levels of Australian government.</span>

I've been very clear that I learned of these matters on 15 February and that my office, I am advised, knew of these matters on 12 February, which is exactly what the Minister for Home Affairs just said.

The commissioner of the Australian Federal Police has advised all of us that what should be done, in respecting the person who is at the centre of this, is to advise and pass this information on to the police. That is what we've been advised to do. That is the process. That is the process the Minister for Defence Industry followed at the time. Had I been in a position of knowing about this earlier, I would have done two things: I would have inquired about the welfare of Brittany Higgins at that time and about what support had been provided to her; and I would have inquired as to whether the matter had been raised with the police.

It is the case that, in both cases, the action of the minister at the time had sought to put support around Brittany Higgins, as they did. As we have apologised for and accepted over time, it is very clear that Brittany did not feel that she had that support.

I want to thank the officers of the Commonwealth Department of Health and the National Indigenous Australians Agency for the way in which they have worked together with both me and my colleague the Minister for Health. The minister established an Indigenous advisory body to provide examples and directions of the activity that needs to be undertaken to ensure that Indigenous Australians have access to the vaccines and, more importantly, to information and to the support services that will prevail in the rollout of the vaccine.</span>

That has the endorsement of the Communicable Diseases Network and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. What they are doing is rolling out culturally safe, comprehensive approaches to ensuring that any Indigenous Australians from homeland communities or rural and remote communities have access to the treatments and the vaccines. And all Indigenous Australians will have the opportunity of accessing the vaccine program.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indigenous Australians aged over 55 will be part of phase 1b, which means we start the process of ensuring that our people are protected against COVID-19. That rollout will require a comprehensive approach from the community controlled health sector, who provide an invaluable service on the ground. That will be done in partnership with GP clinics that are established in particular locations. The vaccine access will mean that we will see families enrol and have the vaccine, and the record of the vaccine will be kept as part of that process.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right at the beginning, we were proactive. We used the Biosecurity Act to protect Indigenous communities across this nation. My colleague, in all the work he has done, has worked closely with me. Our considerations were to ensure that there was not the level of impact we thought would happen. That result has manifested in the very low figures we see within our community.</span>

Why is it that, in fact, almost two weeks after the media broke the story of a reported sexual assault in Parliament House in March 2019, Brittany Higgins, the parliament and the people are still learning details of the government's response? Why isn't the Prime Minister just being straight, and why does his story keep changing?</span>

He can assert these things all he likes, but that does not make them true. We have been very plain and clear. I learned about it on the Monday, and my office, I am advised, learned about it on the previous Friday. I should have been told when my office knew on the Friday. I learned of it on the Monday. I have been very clear about that. I could not be more clear about that.</span>

My government will continue to focus on the issue here, which is the safety of the people who work in our building and what should be done in the event that any one of our staff, or, indeed, any member or senator, are in a situation where they may be in receipt of an allegation or seek to make a complaint themselves, so that members and senators know exactly what they should do in those circumstances. That is why I wrote to the Presiding Officers to advise them of the advice I had received from the commissioner of the Federal Police. I hope that is of some assistance to members and senators if they are put in this situation.</span>

This was a matter that was known to the police and had been looked at by the police, and I am very pleased that Brittany Higgins has re-engaged that process with the police. I look forward to how that investigation proceeds.</span>

He is going to take the Space Agency on the next step of its development, which is to look at how we can create commercial opportunities for our businesses here. We, as a government, understand how important space is not only for our everyday lives and because it inspires our young people to study science and maths at school but also for what it can do to grow our economy here. We have an enormous opportunity to be part of the global space race and to look at how we can develop space as a key manufacturing sector here in Australia. That's why we named space as one of our key national manufacturing priorities. We have already opened the funding for the space sector, under our Modern Manufacturing Initiative. </span>

What is very important with such serious matters is that we allow the police to do their job. They are the ultimate arbiters of how investigations into such sensitive matters are undertaken. They consider and weigh the evidence in that process and, ultimately, they work with the DPP in the event of bringing forward a public prosecution. I make this point because, when it comes to the protection of all Australians on any matter at all, we all rely on the operation of our criminal justice system and the work of our brave law enforcement authorities—our highly expert and sensitive law enforcement authorities. I want to particularly commend those women and men who work in the sensitive area of dealing with victims of sexual assault. </span>

We occupy the driest inhabited continent on earth, and we've always managed our landscapes in the face of a changing climate. Australians understand better than most the importance of adapting to harsh climatic conditions, not just to avoid loss through events like natural disasters but also to unlock opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our environmental scientists are world leading. For example, researchers at the University of Southern Queensland are working to understand which variant of coffee bean will best suit changes in climate, an issue that I know is of deep importance to the member's constituents in the bayside suburbs of Melbourne. It's just one example of planting the right crop in the right place for the right conditions and your enterprise becomes more productive. Rural and regional Australians on this side of the House instinctively know that. In Antarctica, the science that Australia is leading is extraordinary—major research on sustainable krill populations, which are vital to the carbon cycle. And our scientists are putting the world's climate in context with the million-year ice core, analysing and recovering that information.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Queensland, our marine scientists are seeding reefs with heat-resistant corals to help them adapt to warming oceans. Our world-leading coral restoration program is crucial to reef based economies and the work that depends on the reef. For example, the Great Barrier Reef employs 64,000 people, and I know that the special envoy for the reef is fighting for each and every one of those jobs. In the west, our National Environmental Science Program is working with Indigenous rangers to combine science and traditional knowledge to restore the seagrass beds of the World Heritage listed Shark Bay. Healthy estuaries mean healthy breeding grounds for marine life, which in turn mean more-productive fisheries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These ground-level examples demonstrate part of Australia's $15 billion ongoing commitment to building resilience to a changing climate. Climate adaptation is caring for our country, through practical actions like our National Soil Strategy. The strategy means more organic matter, rich in carbon, in our topsoils, which makes our farms more productive and supports more biodiversity in our landscape. The Morrison government is acutely aware not just of the challenges posed by a changing climate but also of the opportunities.</span>

I remember that it was after we had just been together, the Leader of the Opposition and I, in relation to the ovarian cancer breakfast. I was asked by journalists about whether I was unhappy that I hadn't been told about this matter. And I've been asked the same thing here. My response in relation to not being happy about this related to the fact that I did not know about this on Monday. I made no reference to Minister Reynolds. I would have hoped, in relation to Minister Reynolds, that on these matters some anonymised reference to this could have been brought to my attention. If she had done that, I would have done exactly as I indicated to the House right here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, in relation to the Minister for Home Affairs, the Minister for Home Affairs advised my office from his chief of staff to mine. He took that step. He did that, and I was apprised in relation to the then Minister for Defence Industry. That minister did not disclose that in an anonymised way. That is something that I wish she had, but she did not, and her reason for doing that was to protect Brittany Higgins's privacy. She has said that, and I have reflected on how people may form different views about whether that was a wise decision. I've done the same thing. As a result, I would hope that, in the future, if people wish to protect the privacy of any individual, they could raise these matters in an anonymised way. Indeed, the Minister for Home Affairs, as I understand it, was not aware of the identity of Brittany Higgins in that matter. But the Minister for Home Affairs did raise it with my office through his chief of staff to my chief of staff the following day.</span>

I can confirm that the job-ready package is working as intended to deliver more people into courses which have a greater chance of them getting a job at the other end. You might recall that this package was put together last year during the pandemic. It was designed to provide more opportunities for young people to upskill and to do degrees which will get them into work. There were a number of components to this package. First up, there were an additional 30,000 places for young people next year and 100,000 over the course of the decade. That means 100,000 more opportunities for young people to get a government subsidised place at university. I can confirm that this year applications are up seven per cent already, which is a great result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point about this package is that it was very carefully constructed to drop the prices to students for courses that had the best job outcomes. For example, that might include agriculture, nursing, teaching or IT—some of those courses which we've dropped the fees for as a way of encouraging people to go into those courses. I can confirm to the member for Lindsay and to this House that, again, the preliminary data shows this is also having the desired impact. For example, in agriculture—and we know the opportunities in the agricultural sector—we dropped the fees to students by 59 per cent. We have seen, in part because of this, applications go up 16 per cent already. That is a great outcome as a result of that. The Australian Council of Deans of Agriculture has said that, without exception, numbers have gone up across the board for agricultural courses from between five per cent to, in some cases, over 50 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In health courses, including nursing, we reduced the cost to students by 18 per cent and we've seen a 15 per cent increase in applications. Again, that is another great outcome. In education prices are down 42 per cent, and we have seen applications go up 10 per cent. In IT prices to students are down 18 per cent, and applications are up seven per cent. These are great outcomes. Of course, students make up their own minds which courses they do, but they are choosing to apply to those courses which have the best chance of getting a job, and that's what this package was intended to do. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

She knows a lot about doing that. She knows that affordable, reliable energy is absolutely essential for small businesses. The 30,000 small businesses across the Gold Coast rely on affordable, reliable energy. At no time is it more important than now to have access to that affordability. That is why we are supporting community groups and businesses through our energy efficiency program that allows them to invest in equipment and upgrades to reduce their energy bills and bring down emissions at the same time. That includes businesses like Espresso Bonsai cafe in Surfers Paradise and Nobby Beach Holiday Village, businesses that were seriously impacted by what happened to tourism on the Gold Coast because of COVID-19.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this builds on actions that we've taken to keep energy companies accountable through the big stick legislation, the ban we put on sneaky late payment fees and the introduction of price caps for families and small businesses. Report after report is telling us that our plan is working. There have been eight consecutive quarters of year-on-year CPI price reductions in electricity. Hundreds of thousands of families and businesses across Australia have benefited from the default market offer and the price caps we have put in place. That includes, for instance, that a family in Highland Park is up to $794 a year better off as a result of those price caps. A cafe in Surfers Paradise is $6,200 a year better off. A bakery in Broadbeach Waters is $4,400 a year better off as a result of that reform. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are better deals than that available, as the member for Moncrieff knows. All you have to do is go onto the Energy Made Easy website and you can compare offers and get the best possible plan based on your historical usage. I know the SPAR supermarket on Chevron Island has been shopping around. It found significant savings. This is all about the delivering Australians the affordable, reliable energy they deserve at a critical time when we need them to be as competitive as possible, bringing down their energy bills as we bring down emissions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:10</span>):  I do thank the member for Reid for her question. Of course, with her experience as a clinical psychologist before coming into the parliament, she is very well informed about the importance of mental health and, of course, the impacts of access to the internet and some of the dangers that need to be guarded against. This has been a big week for the principle that the internet platforms need to comply with the rule of law if they're doing business in Australia. I want to congratulate the Prime Minister and the Treasurer for their leadership as we pass the news media bargaining code into law.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are working across the full range of areas where it is important to make sure that the rule of law applies in relation to all of the things that we do online, with the internet being a pervasive part of modern life. Keeping Australians safe online has been a focus for this government since we came to government in 2013. We established the word's first eSafety Commissioner to support Australian children experiencing cyberbullying. We expanded the remit of that office to include all Australians and introduced a scheme to support the victims of image based abuse—an absolute scourge. In 2019, we responded to the abhorrent Christchurch mosque attacks by adding the abhorrent violent material legislative measures to the powers of the eSafety Commissioner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are going further. Just this week, we introduced into the parliament a bill to establish a new online safety act, which will establish a new scheme to deal with serious cyberabuse of Australian adults. We're building on the success of our scheme to deal with cyberbullying against children. Of course, there's a higher threshold, recognising that adults are more resilient and that we need to properly balance freedom of speech issues. For the first time, there will be the capacity to go to the eSafety Commissioner if you've been the victim of vicious, abhorrent abuse online, and she will have the power to determine whether that meets the statutory standard and, if so, to issue a take-down notice which the platforms will be required to comply with. We're expanding the cyberbullying scheme so that we go beyond social media platforms to, for example, chat services as part of games. We're going to have basic online safety expectations and, of course, the eSafety Commissioner will have new powers to go to the platforms and to internet providers and others and say, 'Give us information about the identity of the person who has posted this abhorrent material,' and civil penalties can be levied against that person.</span>

Just by way of context for those questions for you: on Monday I asked the Prime Minister a question that included references to access to Parliament House, and the Prime Minister said at the end of that question time that some of those matters were within your responsibility. On Tuesday, the Prime Minister partly responded by advising that the alleged rapist of Brittany Higgins did not have a parliamentary pass, but he did not provide any further information about whether the alleged rapist entered Parliament House or other Commonwealth offices. Again, for completeness of context: on Wednesday, in response to a question from the Greens Senate leader, Larissa Waters, the government leader in the Senate advised on behalf of the Prime Minister that the alleged rapist was on the lobbyist register for some time. Today there are media reports that the alleged rapist has in fact been inside Parliament House since the alleged rape.</span>

I ask: can you inform the House whether the alleged rapist of Ms Higgins has been present in Parliament House since the alleged rape and, if so, when, in what circumstances and who provided him access to the building?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">15:16</span>):  I thank the member for Melbourne. As the Prime Minister said the other day, with the information that the President of the Senate and I provided to him, there's no permanent pass but, if someone's signed in, that's a manual record, and what we'd advised was that it's impossible to know quickly whether that was the case. Just to give the member for Melbourne and members of the House some context, I've got a sample of the number of people signed in just for a week in November of 2019—just one week that's been picked for a sample. On the Monday, it's 566; on the Tuesday, 717; on the Wednesday, 825; and, on the 28th, 601. That's to give you some context of the number of people that are signed in. As to the question you've asked about, as I said, it isn't a simple task to get an answer to that. But I undertake to consult with the President of the Senate and examine any other issues that might be pertinent to that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You asked the broader question about entering Parliament House. Anyone can enter the public areas. You asked about Commonwealth parliamentary offices. They are not the responsibility of the Presiding Officers. You asked about the lobbyist register. That is not the responsibility of the Presiding Officers. As for what meetings might have happened in ministerial offices, that's not the responsibility of the Presiding Officers. But I undertake to come back to the member for Melbourne. I'm being very clear that, for the reasons I've outlined, it won't be today, but I'll come back to the parliament.</span>

Lisa's due in early April. I wasn't sure, but they are happy for everyone to know that Daisy will be joined by a little brother.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:21</span>):  Well, this has been quite an extraordinary fortnight in this parliament. From time to time, we speak about waste in the form of this government's attitude towards public funds. We've spoken about sports rorts, the capacity to rort absolutely anything and distort outcomes politically—even security from the Minister for Home Affairs—and regional grants rorts. Everything this government does, it puts a political focus on it. I do think that the biggest waste of taxpayers' money that we've seen is the $190,000 of taxpayers' money spent on an empathy consultant for this Prime Minister, because this Prime Minister is an empathy vacuum. All he understands is politics and he consistently acts in his own political interests rather than the national interest. This is a prime minister Australians know doesn't have their back because he's too busy looking after his own. This is a prime minister who is not on the side of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw it firsthand in this term of his prime ministership, I think, with the issue of the bushfires. Remember that? 'I don't hold a hose, mate,' was his response to justify his complete complacency in the lead-up to those bushfires. What we know is that that complacency and lack of empathy has continued with a complete failure to look after people who are still living in caravans or who are still waiting for support in electorates like Gilmore, in electorates like Eden-Monaro and in electorates like Macquarie, but also in electorates held by government members. There has been a complete failure, for example, to allocate money based upon an annual allocation for an emergency response fund; zero was spent last financial year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw it as well during the pandemic. We know that the federal government is responsible for the issue of aged care. We've lost 685 older Australians to the pandemic in aged-care homes. Scott Morrison's response: 'When it rains, everyone gets wet.' That is what he actually said. Now we're seeing the rollout of the COVID vaccine being bungled—one more area this government's responsibility where, I expect, we will again see a lack of empathy from the Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen it with regard to the robodebt debacle. People were given bills for money that they didn't owe to the government, with tragic consequences. There was literally a loss of lives as a result of that. From this government there was no response, no empathy whatsoever. They settled a court case in order to try to move the issue on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a prime minister who has a management textbook where his heart should be. He's a political manager, not a prime minister. In his world, appearance beats substance every time. I have said before, he's all smirk and mirrors. It's always about the play, always about the spin, always about what the politics of an issue are; not about addressing issues on the basis of their substance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We see it with the squirming that we see in question time every day, where the Prime Minister purports to suggest that the story isn't changing every day—that somehow we all knew, weeks ago, that at the beginning of last week the Minister for Home Affairs was added to the list of ministers who knew about the reported sexual assault on Brittany Higgins. We know now that the minister's chief of staff told his chief of staff. But, again, apparently, it would be alleged that still no-one told the Prime Minister. We know that a member of the Prime Minister's staff knew two years ago, because that member of the Prime Minister's staff was the chief of staff to the minister for whom Brittany Higgins worked, and that was the office where the reported sexual assault occurred. He's just playing with words to say that his office did not know. That is just a fact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A second member of his staff, we know through the text messages—including to Brittany Higgins—said that it would be raised with his chief of staff. That was two years ago. A third member of his staff knew that the alleged perpetrator was dismissed two years ago. And the person who Brittany Higgins describes as the 'fixer' in his office checked in with Ms Higgins, not once, at the time of the reported sexual assault, but also after the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we had ministers who knew, and his office knew. People knew it had been reported to the AFP. The minister had actually asked for a report on what the appropriate response should be during that period and received it before Brittany Higgins was put back into the room for a meeting where the reported sexual assault occurred. Yet this Prime Minister would have us believe that no-one told him—no-one told him! The circumstances are still that the only person who seems to have actually lost their job and suffered here is of course Brittany Higgins—the victim. For everyone else it's all okay. He said that he's disappointed that the chief of staff didn't tell him, in spite of the media, other ministers' offices and everyone telling him that it had occurred. It's just absurd. The questions that were being asked by journalists and by others were not a trivial matter. At the end of the day, these were allegations about a serious crime. The idea that he did not know is just not credible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, to rub salt into the wound, he has his former chief of staff doing an inquiry into what his office knew. We've asked pretty simple questions—things like, 'Why don't you just ask your chief of staff what happened and tell us?' But, instead, we have the Gaetjens inquiry—the same person who looked after the sports rorts inquiry—and it's going to be a cabinet-in-confidence document. So it won't be released. Come back in 30 years! It's just extraordinary that that's the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that the fish rots from the head. This is a government characterised by cover-up, a government characterised by treating taxpayers' money as if it's its own and a government that is not on the side of the Australian people. This is what characterises the government. Whether it's sports rorts, community safety rorts, grassgate, watergate, forged documents or matters as grave as bushfires, the pandemic or reported sexual assault, the Prime Minister always thinks about the politics and he never accepts responsibility. It's always someone else. No wonder this government doesn't want a national integrity commission. This Prime Minister promised it in 2018 but the fact is that they've walked away from that commitment as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We see it in this parliament with legislation. The only thing we did yesterday was to change a couple of words about freedom of speech; that's quite ironic from a government that shuts down freedom of speech in this chamber. They don't have an agenda coming out of the COVID pandemic; that is very, very clear. They have an agenda about themselves, an obsession with themselves, an obsession with protecting themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Prime Minister doesn't have your back because he's too busy protecting his own back. He doesn't have your back if you want security of work. He doesn't have your back if you want to be confident of safety in your own workplace. He doesn't have your back if you expect him to keep renegade MPs like Craig Kelly from endangering public health. He certainly doesn't have your back if you're risking your life delivering food for $10 an hour on an old bike. This government—and we supported them—stood up on the issue of the media code. But when it comes to standing up on the issue of gig workers, they say, 'It's all too hard; it's complicated.' What's complicated about paying people the minimum wage in this country? What's complicated about decent wages and conditions that most Australians take for granted? The fact is that this Prime Minister has shown a lot about his character since he took over the job. Empathy lies outside of the limits of Scott Morrison's character. That's clear to one and all, and unfortunately it's been on full display in the last fortnight.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HOGAN:</span>
                  </a>  The majority of people, even Labor voters, are saying that to us because at their hearts, their major interests right now and what is dear to them are the two things we have been talking about as a government for the last 12 months: the health of our country, of our population; and the jobs of our country, of our people. That's what people go home and think about. Their health and their livelihood are their major issues. We, on any international measurement that you want to have a look at, are doing well on the health front. Even though every fatality has been a tragedy, we've been one of the countries in the world with the lowest ratio on the fatality front. On the economic front we are doing better than just about any other country in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deloitte, an international accounting firm, said four or five weeks ago that there is no better country in the world to be in right now than Australia. Why is that the case? Some of it is the parameters the federal government has put into place. The Australian public has done a wonderful job, too, adhering to the education things we put out. We declared this a pandemic before the World Health Organization; that's how quickly we were on the front foot about this. We saw the dangers of the pandemic on the health front and on the economic front. It is because we've done so well on the health front that we're doing better than most on the economic front. We brought in restrictions. We did the whole education process about hand hygiene and social distancing, and the Australian people, God bless them, got on board. That has been one of the big reasons we've done so well. Our fatality rates are lower than just about any other country's, and our economy is doing better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If people remember, it was about this time last year that around the globe we were all becoming aware of what we might be dealing with. The language back then was: 'You've got to flatten the curve. We can't have a situation where too many people want ventilators and they're not available, so the main thing you have to do is flatten the curve.' We went well beyond flattening the curve. There have been some hiccups. I don't want to be partisan about this, because we should all really be on the same team with this; I won't mention Victoria and Dan Andrews, and I won't mention some of the hiccups we've had. Generally we've done very well. We have flattened the curve. We have done better than flatten the curve. The worst-case scenarios that were modelled, that we were worried about and that we as a government had to deal with—we've done better than what any of those models predicted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what an exciting week this was! This is probably one of the first weeks that we've started to get on to the front foot in this pandemic, with the vaccine rollout. We're in phase 1a, with aged-care workers and quarantine workers, and all those who are highly exposed or highly at risk, getting the vaccine this week. It's a six-week rollout, which, as the health minister gave an update on this morning, is on time. This is a really exciting week. If we had known 12 months ago how we were going to manage this pandemic—yes, there have been some hiccups—how this country was going to manage this threat that we had, we would have been really happy that this was going to roll out the way it has. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've spoken a little bit about health, but I want to touch on the economy as well. People are worried about their health, but they're worried about their jobs, too. We're not out of the woods—the globe isn't out of the woods. This virus could mutate, and there are a lot of unknowns about what could happen from here on in. We're certainly not out of the woods. One of the things the pandemic did that we were all very concerned about—we knew what we had to do on the health front, we knew we had to flatten the curve, we knew we had to have restrictions and we knew we had to close businesses temporarily to try and get everything under control—was that people just could not get enough staff; that was the unknown then. I had major concerns about what this might do to our economy, not just to our local economies but to our national economy and, indeed, to the global economy, because we faced great threats and still do. But even on the economic front, we have done exceptionally well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure it's probably the same in your patch, Deputy Speaker, but one of the biggest issues that we have in my patch is that people can't get enough staff. And these aren't necessarily just jobs that people don't want. These are good jobs. People normally want these jobs. People would normally be falling over themselves to work in some of these trades or in some of these retail and hospitality jobs. And we just cannot get enough staff. But this hasn't happened by accident. We all hear and read reports from overseas. I've read reports just this week from the UK, Spain and South Africa. There are a lot of countries right now doing it really tough. So this hasn't happened by accident. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I go back to the budget. We brought down the budget later than normal last year because of the pandemic. What did we focus on in the budget? We focused on jobs. We did everything we could that we could think of that we thought would motivate small, medium-size and large businesses to employ people. And, touch wood, so far that's working. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that eight out of 10 jobs in this country are in the private sector. So what did we do? We have spent literally hundreds of billions of dollars, over $200 billion, in stimulus spending. We know JobKeeper was an exceptionally important thing we did right at the start, to make sure the employee had a relationship with their employer. That was very important. Some of these businesses, especially in April last year, had to shut down through no fault of their own. We knew it was very important to keep those relationships going and to keep that money spinning around the economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing we did in the budget was the tax cuts. We talk about wanting wages to increase. A tax cut is a wage increase. We gave a tax cut to 11½ million people in the budget last year. We gave the JobMaker Hiring Credit. We gave a subsidy for businesses that are going to employ a new person, especially young people aged between 18 and 35, and that's worked. Then there is the instant asset write-off; I mention this one nearly every time I come into this chamber, because of how powerful it has been. It's a magnificent economic stimulus that we used quite a number of years ago, on a much smaller scale. We put that in the budget last year, and we put it on steroids. I've had numerous businesses around my electorate say: 'That works. Every time you announce that and it gets publicised, we see further spending.' Especially after the budget last year, there's been big stimulus spending on the back of that. So, again, we are focused on health, focused on keeping us safe and focused on jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are some of the other highlights from this to keep the economy ticking over. We're doing a $2 billion investment in R&amp;D, because what this pandemic has also done is to highlight that we talk about being a more self-reliant Australia, and we're certainly looking to do that. Yes, because of this we have seen some weaknesses in different supply chains that we need to correct, and we are doing so. Again in the budget, we brought out a manufacturing plan across six different areas: defence, space, medicine, food, resources, and recycling and clean energy. We realise that we are putting government assistance into those areas to make sure our supply chains are solid and that we can do anything that's really important to us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other exciting thing in the budget, I thought, was the apprenticeship scheme. Why? Because it was focused on jobs. There was special regional funding as well. It's created its challenges, but one of the quite pleasant and interesting spin-offs from this is that there has been movement of people from cities to regions. The regions, obviously, are doing very well. There's a lot of pressure on with people moving, with houses and rentals, but there are a lot of good things happening in the economy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:41</span>):  When asked, 'What qualities do you deem most important in a politician or a political leader?' Australians answered three things: honesty, truthfulness and trust. They are the results of a survey by the McKinnon Prize in Political Leadership. Australians care about ethical behaviour. They want their political leaders to demonstrate those values of honesty and truthfulness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If those are the qualities that Australians care about then they have been left behind and let down by a Prime Minister who doesn't hold a hose; a Prime Minister who claims that he knew nothing—nothing—of an alleged sexual assault just metres away from his office, where the story changes on an hourly basis; a Prime Minister who had to ask his wife how to respond to the sexual assault. I'm the mother of boys. I have two sons. Should that change the way in which I respond to something as serious as a sexual assault? This is a Prime Minister who's presided over sports rorts, grassgate, watergate and forged documents and who shrugs off his responsibility, whether it's in response to bushfires, to quarantine or, indeed, to an alleged sexual assault.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this week, we saw that a general practitioner with no training was administering doses of this much-awaited vaccine. We can't put this down to human error, because it's not human error; it is actually a systemic vulnerability, just as with those people in Bendigo who waited for their doses of the vaccine that didn't arrive. It is a systemic vulnerability, and it happened because the government were so busy crowing on about themselves that they actually forgot to do anything about it. They actually forgot to put in those systems and ensure that the system for distributing the vaccines was not open to such vulnerabilities. That is the story that we've seen while this government has been in power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Prime Minister sets the bar for other members of this government. We have the Minister for Home Affairs walking around this place as if he wears his underpants on the outside, as if he's the saviour of the universe, as if he's going to save each and every one of us. But it's very clear that what he's interested in is saving Liberal seats. We saw him overrule his own department on grants on safer communities. He walks around talking about how he's going to keep everybody safe and then overrules his own department in order to fund seats that the government were interested in keeping. Even I know pork when I see it. Even I know that's pork. Even the member for Chifley recognised that as pork.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that I love about our citizenship ceremonies is that when Australians take the pledge of citizenship, they do something that is, in my mind, unique. They pledge their loyalty not just to Australia; they pledge their loyalty to Australia and its people. I love that part of the citizenship ceremony. Every time I attend a citizenship ceremony, it brings a tear to my eye to know those who become new Australians are pledging their loyalty not to this thing called a nation but to the Australian people. Where is this Prime Minister's loyalty to the Australian people when he fails to act in the national interest, instead acting in his own political interest? Australians are not a target audience to be segmented and to be targeted in some slick marketing campaign. They are real people with real lives and real issues and real concerns, and they want better from their leadership. They want better from this Prime Minister who 'doesn't hold a hose, mate'.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My dear friend Barry Jones has a dear friend. I recall hearing his dear friend Phillip Adams say on his 'little wireless program' some time ago that he's very nervous when he hears a politician talk of the national interest, because it usually means the politician's interest. I would not like to alarm Mr Adams, but I want to refer obliquely to the national interest as I see it in this place, and I quote former leader of the Liberal Party and Prime Minister Robert Menzies, who said: 'I firmly believe that any man in public life, or woman, who thinks that politics to him or her is just a job that will provide him with an income is making the most gross of all errors. The truth is that we must be servants of the people, but, in order to be servants of the people, we are not to be servile. We are not to look at every problem and then say, "Will this be popular or will this not be popular?" Because if that is the kind of leadership you're going to get, it will lead the country to disaster. It is not a matter of saying, "Will this please somebody," it is a matter of saying, "Is this the right thing to do if Australia is going to grow, if the country is going to become richer and or more powerful, if employment is to rise, if living standards are to rise," and, sir, that presents a problem which is a great challenge to many a man of character, honesty and imagination.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we come to a proposition like this—'in the national interest'—I say the decisions that we make in this House, the decisions the executive make and the decisions that we make as individuals can sometimes be very difficult. We test those often against the will of the people who elect us to the parliament, the people who actually put their pencils on pieces of paper to say, 'I want this person to represent me in this house.' This is crucially important to our national wellbeing. That's why I've always been a very strong supporter of compulsory voting, because everybody—everybody!—goes into that booth and has a go and says: 'This is who I want to support me. And if I can't get that one to support me, I get two or three other chances by ticking the other boxes.' It's a very, very good system to decide who represents—and what did they do at the last election? The whole nation came and voted, and they were within one seat or two seats of who held the majority in this House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Australia made their decision, and they expect us to not only represent them and their interests; they expect us to represent our parties that clearly put us here and they expect us to make decisions at a national level having regard to what is said in our party rooms, what is said in our caucus, and to bravely then make a decision. As a woman said to me one day, 'We didn't put you in there to be a yes-man; we put you in there to make decisions on our behalf.' Throughout my many years in this place—although I've been thrown out more times than anybody else in the history of the parliament and am still here—</span>

                  </a>  Thank you very much. I have had 21 years and I've seen very good people in this place wrestle with their conscience. There is a difference between the opposition—and I'm not talking about the Independents—and the Liberal Party. When Andrew Fisher formed the Labor Party and put the coalition together he said, 'If you vote against us, you leave.' Menzies said the opposite. He said, 'You can disagree with us and still stay within the confines of the party,' although that could be very uncomfortable at times. Many members have come into this House and spoken with heartfelt determination and confidence on behalf of the people that they represent. We respect them taking the opportunity to do that. It is an absolute privilege to serve in this House. I hope for all of us our first focus is the national interest.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:51</span>):  It's with great pleasure that I rise to make a contribution to this matter of public importance debate on the government acting in the national interest—or the government's neglect, and often missed opportunities, to act in the national interest. I share the view of the previous speaker, the member for Monash, that it is an absolute honour to stand in this House. Every one of us feels that. But I have to tell you that I am a little worried that the Prime Minister and his government have engaged an empathy consultant in order to figure out how they might convince the Australian people that they care. That is a problem. It cost $190,000. It was meant to be $80,000, but there was a big cost blow-out because it's a very big job trying to figure out how you convey empathy if it is not in your genetic make-up. The consultant firm was called Futureye, if I'm not mistaken. It was a little more indicative of the fact that the Prime Minister certainly had an eye on his future and what was needed to be done. Trying to develop empathy, if it's not there at the start, is a big job, so it's no surprise that the cost blew out from $80,000 to $190,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I think about the missed opportunities, the neglect and the failures of this government, there is a very long list. We are in the eighth year of a conservative government in Australia and the list of achievements is not long. Indeed, at the beginning of the week my colleagues reminded me how light on, how lacking in reform, how lacking in vision and how lacking in ambition the parliamentary business of this sitting week was. There is no substance to this government whatsoever. They've become political managers and administrators. There are serious costs to that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen a terrible crisis in aged care, for example, and the tragic death of 685 people in aged care. Clearly that is a Commonwealth responsibility, but the government shirked its responsibility during the global pandemic in that regard. Quarantine is another clear Commonwealth responsibility. That has been palmed off to the states and territories to govern. With the bushfires, we all recall the now infamous quote, 'I don't hold the hose.' That's part of the problem. This is a Prime Minister who doesn't actually think he is able to make a personal contribution in times of crisis. We've seen that on full display these last couple of weeks, and I will come back to that in a moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was reminded of the failure to spend a billion dollars that had been budgeted for TAFE and training programs, despite a massive skills shortage in Australia; the failure to adopt and take to heart the Uluru statement; the ongoing failure to deliver on a promise to constitutionally enshrine a voice in this parliament and to ensure there's a truth-telling and treaty-making process in this nation; the shocking fiasco of robodebt and the cost of $1.2 billion in court payouts just to try and make this problem go away; and the lack of leadership on climate action, with no effort to diversify carbon-intensive economies in regions like my own. The lack of ambition there is astonishing. There is the failure to make the serious reforms on our National Redress Scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The lack of accountability when it comes to domestic violence is appalling. We know that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been unprecedented demand for services. Whilst this government directed some additional funds that way, we know Women's Safety NSW have told us they need $12 billion over 12 years in order to make some serious inroads into domestic and family violence in Australia. I was at the International Women's Day breakfast this morning. I heard the Prime Minister talk a lot about respect. He didn't talk about equality, he didn't talk about inequities in this nation, and he didn't talk about the serious reforms that must take place in our nation if we're to do better. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We're effectively 12 months on from one of the great health challenges the world has faced, and there's certainly light at the end of the tunnel this week. Honesty, truth and trust: I'm glad those three concepts were raised by an opposition speaker. They are fair benchmarks to be applied to a government. If you walk the streets of Australia at the moment, you definitely get the sense that this is inherently a population of Australians who are very, very happy with the direction of both their federal and their state governments.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's acknowledge that, during this COVID period, it's a tough ask to be chipping away at an incumbent government, regardless of which side of politics you're on. I know, Deputy Speaker Llew O'Brien, you will have experienced that yourself, and, in WA, we're seeing exactly the same thing. It's not an easy game being in opposition. It's easy enough to make a series of talking points about why you don't like the government, but they always seem a little hollow when you leave this green chamber and you notice that those are not the topics people are actually talking about around the water bubbler or the barbecue. What they are talking about at the moment is the nation staying the course and the government being strong enough to ensure that that happens. They want to know that there is sensible tax reform, investment in skills and these elements of direct and local intervention where there are problems. As long as they sense that that's happening, they're going to be pretty happy with how things are going. If you look at basic polls and you see that only 12 per cent of voters actually are undecided about who is leading the country, that's a very impressively low number, because they know who is running the country and they're happy with how it's being done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They're happy for a few reasons. One is that, as a developed country, we're like a cyclist in a Tour de France peloton and we sit somewhere near the front of that peloton. I can see a recent convert to cycling on the other side, and a not impressive first performance either, I have to say. You'd appreciate that staying at the front of the peloton is always the place to be, not hanging off the back. Australia recognises, as one of just nine countries with a AAA credit rating, it has a reputation to defend. We have 27 years of economic growth. That has come to an end with COVID, but we're bouncing back, with 3.3 per cent growth in the last quarter. We are seeing eye-watering numbers, with 784,000 new jobs created since COVID. These figures are the envy of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't ascribe all of that to the government. You ascribe it to the conditions created within the economy, the hard work of employers and the willingness of employees to work cooperatively together. It's a bit of everything, isn't it? It's not about singling out one or the other or identifying who you hate or starting internecine fights. Today is a time to recognise that we are definitely, still with challenges, absolutely on track. You just get that gut feeling that, when each and every one of us go back to our communities, they want a reliable set of hands and to keep staying the course. We can choose not to stay the course; there are easy options there. We can take easy choices, but that hasn't been done, because this government that reduced government spending growth at four per cent per annum, brought it back, responsibly, to 1.3.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is that important? Because we were ready for COVID when the great drain came on our fiscal state. And, while we may well have deepened the deficit and deepened debt, in comparison with other countries, we've done exceptionally well. They're right to point out on the other side that that takes us to 35 per cent debt to GDP, but that is utterly manageable in a strong and well-managed commodity economy like Australia's, particularly in this low-interest-rate environment. That makes it important to make sure that we actually do have these local community infrastructure investments in really big projects and that, if someone has some skills, then they're nudged into these great work opportunities in the middle of COVID, not in six or 12 months time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We learnt a lot about how to manage crises. I learnt it two decades ago, back in the era of Y2K. We didn't learn as much as we could have about the GFC, and 10 years on we have this crisis. What we know about this crisis is that there's nothing more important than keeping people in jobs. One million businesses will attest to the benefits of JobKeeper. And 3.1 million workers will attest to the fact that they saw money coming in directly to their employer from this federal government. The JobMaker scheme targeted the demographics that were most at risk of losing their job. Without for a moment wanting to generalise, women—often in hospitality, tourism and major events—under the age of 35 were annihilated by COVID, and this government was right to have a job-making hiring credit in there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had a few tussles with Treasury. My big policies personally have been the deposit assistance scheme and a JobMaker employment incentive. Both those things are a reality, and this nation says thank you to a government that delivered on them and delivered on them on time, and has maintained a stronger economy that is the envy of the rest of the world.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  During question time, one of the favourite responses of government ministers to dorothy dixers is to take the first 30 seconds or so to wax lyrical about the leadership of member X prior to their political career and to then expound on their leadership since they've come to this place. Sometimes it's a stretch. It's a predictable and repeated piece of theatre, even if at times you can feel the pain of ministers reaching to come up with things that underpin the glowing appraisals of their colleagues. God help them if they had to open every response with 30 seconds on the leadership qualities of the Prime Minister!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that is led by a Prime Minister who always puts political interests ahead of the national interest, a government that lacks integrity and transparency at every turn, where the vast potential of the national cabinet is clouded by palming off responsibility for failures or significant challenges to the states and territories while attempting to take credit for any successes. As many of you know, the great Harry S Truman famously had a sign on his desk that read, 'The buck stops here'. An appropriate sign for the Prime Minister would be, 'I am advised that the buck stops anywhere but here'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government and a Prime Minister that has let down my constituents and this nation from the cradle to the grave. If you are from a community in crisis following a devastating bushfire, the Prime Minister will tell you he doesn't hold a hose. If you are a young worker who is stuck in long-term casual employment, this government wants to make it harder for you to find a permanent job. When your community was locked down either last year or this year and you were doing it tough, this government went for cheap shots rather than leadership. If you are a mid-career worker striving to save for retirement, this Prime Minister wants you to get less superannuation, making your retirement harder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you're a resident in a nursing home anywhere across this nation, know that this Prime Minister, when he was Treasurer, cut almost $2 billion from the aged-care budget. If you're a person who cares about transparency in government, know that this is a government that cuts the audit office's budget, has no interest in a genuine integrity commission and looks to cover up first, second and third. If you're a local sporting organisation in desperate need of facilities, this is a government that puts its desperate political interests ahead of your community. And, if you have a young family struggling to pay childcare fees, this is a government that won't help you balance the books.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government whose action on virtually every front is at odds with the wishes of the Australian people. On which of its policies does the government actually have the nation's backing?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On which of its policies are they on your side? On encouraging more insecure work? On refusing to support the minimum wage for every Australian worker? On removing JobKeeper from industries that clearly need it? On not learning the lessons from last year on the value of having JobSeeker at an adequate level? On gutting vocational education and making tertiary education unaffordable for thousands of school leavers? On rorting any grants program that moves? On the lack of transparency and integrity that has become the hallmark of this government? This government are not on your side and they've conducted themselves with an arrogance and an insensitivity which has appalled the nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In case the Prime Minister thinks that these criticisms come exclusively from the Labor side of the fence, the House needs no reminding of the extensive commentary from previous leaders of the Liberal Party who are sickened by the rotten state of this government. This is a government from which nobody resigns unless absolutely forced to do so by overwhelming pressure from the public, the media and their own backbenchers. It's all about the cover-up. Is it any wonder that people see a government out of touch with the nation's needs, refusing to take responsibility for its actions and operating on no key principle other than that of its own survival?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't have to be this way. There are many examples which we can point back to where it was quite different. We can point to Curtin, our great wartime Prime Minister; Chifley, the builder of our nation; Whitlam, the profound reformer; Hawke, the great man of the people who promoted consensus; Keating, the policy visionary; Rudd, the PM who rightfully said sorry; and Gillard, the champion of education— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LIU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  This government is definitely acting in the national interest. The Australian people have endured a global pandemic of historic proportions. It is an event which will forever resonate throughout the pages of schoolbooks as children learn of the past. For many countries, the consequences have been particularly devastating. We witnessed the world teeter on the edge of persistent economic turbulence, with death tolls that continue to spiral. The question must be asked: why are we watching countries all around the globe fall into this tragic state while Australia continues to show resilience? Relatively speaking, the death toll in Australia has been low compared to others. While some countries have had their people dying in the hundreds of thousands, we have only suffered a death toll in the hundreds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I go on, I want to make it very clear that every death that occurs is unacceptable. But we have to take a moment to appreciate how quickly we managed to get it right in Australia. We have to take a moment to appreciate that it was through this government's fast and effective response, which involved shutting down the borders and treating this as the serious health crisis that it is, that we have prevented so many more from losing their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If it weren't for the actions of the Victorian Labor Party in mismanaging the crisis they created, the death toll would have been far lower than it is currently. Beyond that, the Morrison government is defying the global trend of rebuilding our economy at an impressive rate. While we were in the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic, our economy contracted by seven per cent. In comparison, New Zealand's fell by 11 per cent, France's fell by 14 per cent and the UK's fell by 20 per cent. We are still outcompeting our friends across the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now that we have gathered a firm handle on the pandemic, our real GDP is bouncing back. In the September quarter, the real GDP increased by 3.3 per cent. This is far ahead of market expectations. In fact, this is the largest quarterly increase since 1976. On top of this, over a seven-month period last year the Morrison government oversaw the creation of 784,000 new jobs for working Australians and we continue to create more through our innovative programs, like JobMaker and JobTrainer. We are setting Australians up not only for the present but also for the future, all the while continuing to maintain our treasured AAA credit rating from the three leading credit ratings agencies. We are one of only nine countries to do so. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has never stopped acting in the national interest. Our strong economy is no accident. The tireless work of successive Liberal governments put Australia in the best position to weather the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the Morrison government that entrenched and maintained the strength of our economy so it could remain resilient throughout this global turmoil. Australians know that Liberal governments are the best economic managers. The results speak for themselves. We are rebuilding the economy, putting people back in jobs and rolling out the vaccine to all Australians. It is only a Morrison government that can keep Australians prosperous and continue to look out for the national interest of this country we call home. I repeat: the Morrison government has always acted in the national interest.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  This is a government that consistently fails to act in the nation's best interests. Those opposite only act in their own political interest, and they take no responsibility for anything. They always put their own specific political interests ahead of the country's interests, and they're not on the side of everyday Australians. Always remember: this Prime Minister doesn't have your back. He's too busy protecting his own back and his own self-interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all remember the bushfires and how he had no empathy for those bushfire victims. In his own words, he said, 'I don't hold a hose, mate.' That was his response to this terrible tragedy. The Prime Minister has had no empathy during the pandemic. He palms off his responsibilities to the states all the time. The Prime Minister has had no empathy for all of those coronavirus victims. We lost 685 older Australians in our aged-care homes due to the pandemic. Aged care is the federal government's responsibility, yet the government has refused to take responsibility for it and to act appropriately. Now we're seeing the rollout of the COVID vaccine being totally bungled. That's another thing this government is responsible for and has messed up. There's just no limit to the extent to which this government prioritises politics. No matter what the occasion, with them it's always politics first and Australians second.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently the extremely courageous Brittany Higgins told her distressing account of how she was sexually assaulted in a minister's office, just metres from the Prime Minister's office. Make no mistake: in relation to this devastating incident, the Prime Minister is again choosing politics and acting in his political interest, denying all knowledge and saying, 'No-one told me.' Of course he knew, but he walks in here every day and pretends that he didn't. The cover-up continues. Rather than actually reaching out to Ms Higgins, the Prime Minister had his media unit briefing journalists against her. There's no empathy, just politics. There's no humanity, just harm. The Prime Minister has failed to provide empathy, support or respect for Ms Higgins. The Prime Minister and his ministers failed to provide their legally binding duty of care. This isn't a choice you make; it's your legal obligation. We have the highest office in the land refusing to fulfil its duty of care and choosing its political interests over the welfare of a young woman. On so many levels, this is wrong, disgraceful and wilfully negligent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a former police officer, I'd like to remind the Prime Minister and his government that rape is not a political problem to be covered up. Rape is a crime. I simply cannot fathom that no-one, not one person in that ministerial wing, fulfilled their legally binding duty of care to Ms Higgins. Instead of giving her compassion and support to get justice, they have just cut her adrift. She's been denied justice. It must stop. Their cover-ups and their denials must stop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that Australians have just had enough of this Prime Minister and his government. We see so many of the constant cover-ups, and that is what always characterises this government. It's what always drives them—their own political interests, not the nation's interests. It doesn't matter whether it's sports rorts, community safety rorts, forged documents or really grave matters like our terrible bushfires, the COVID-19 pandemic and reported sexual assaults, the Prime Minister always thinks about his political interests first and he never, ever accepts responsibility. Australians have had enough of this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians have realised that the Prime Minister doesn't have their backs because he's too busy protecting his own. The fact is he doesn't have your back if you want security of work. He doesn't have your back if you want access to health care or aged care. He does haven't your back if you want to be confident of safety in your workplace. The fact is that this Prime Minister, this government, the Liberals and the Nationals, are not on your side. The only side they are on, all of them—the Prime Minister, all Liberals and all the Nationals—is their own side, their own political self-interest. In doing so, they are neglecting all Australians. They are putting their political interests first and not the nation's interests first.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HYM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr IRONS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  I rise to speak on the MPI. Firstly I'd like to say that this government is acting in the national interest of all Australians. We've heard from the member for Monash and the member for Bowman, who were quite eloquent in their speeches, about what this place is about and what our obligations and duties are as elected representatives to the people of Australia. We might talk about the definition of 'national interest'. On this side, the definition of 'national interest' is looking after the interests of the Australian population, SMEs, quiet Australians and all the people who live in and bear the benefits of being part of this nation. Those on the other side, though, have one other obligation which is higher than the national interest—that's their obligation to unions. We've seen that every time they talk about any of our programs. It's always about what the unions want. So their definition of the national interest is the interest of the unions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who has played AFL or any team sports can see exactly what their tactics are now. As we know, when people get desperate in team sports, they play the man. They don't play the game anymore; they play the man. The member for Corio's beloved Geelong team is a perfect example. At the 1989 VFL grand final, Mark Yeates, the hard man from Geelong, broke the square and smashed into Dermott Brereton and broke two of his ribs. Dermott Brereton still took the hits, and what happened was the Hawks still went on to win by six points. So playing the man doesn't work. Play the game; don't play the man. What we've seen here in all the speeches from across the aisle is them attacking the Prime Minister—not talking about the national interest but just attacking the Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To get back to talking about the national interest, I'll just talk about some of the things this government has been doing in the national interest. As we know, COVID-19 has resulted in the most severe global economic crisis since the Great Depression. Across the world, the equivalent of 600 million people have lost their jobs. The global economy is expected to contract by four per cent this year, compared to just 0.01 per cent during the global financial crisis. So we can see a good contrast there. In April 2020, more than one million Australians lost their jobs or saw their working hours reduced to zero. In March, Treasury was contemplating a collapse in GDP of more than 20 per cent in the June quarter. In May, it was forecasting a GDP fall of over 10 per cent in the June 2020 quarter. In the June 2020 quarter, Australia's economy contracted by seven per cent. This compares to around an 11 per cent fall in New Zealand, a 14 per cent fall in France and a 20 per cent fall in the UK.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now Australia's economy is fighting back. In the September quarter, the real GDP increased by 3.3 per cent on market expectations. This is the largest quarterly increase since 1976. Over seven months, from May to December, over 784,000 jobs were created. Ninety per cent of the 1.3 million Australians who either lost their jobs or saw their working hours reduced to zero are now back at work. Australia is one of the nine countries to have a AAA credit rating from the three leading credit agencies. Technically Australia's recession may be over, but our economic recovery is not. There remains a monumental task ahead in rebuilding our economy and supporting jobs in the national interest. As we heard today from the Treasurer, with more good news, the last quarter saw an increase of three per cent in capital investment, the best result in Australia since 2012.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our economic recovery plan is that the Morrison government has a plan to rebuild our economy and create jobs. The JobMaker hiring credit will support nearly half a million young Australians in work. Our record investment in skills and training will strengthen Australia's workforce. Our manufacturing plan will support the recovery and build our sovereign capability. Tax incentives will help unleash a wave of investment across the country, and tax cuts will put more money into the pockets of 11 million hardworking Australians and their families. We are building the infrastructure we need for the future. We are guaranteeing health care and the essential services Australians rely on. We will do this by growing the economy, not by increasing taxes. Also, to unlock investment, the Morrison government is expanding the successful instant asset write-off. Over 99 per cent of business will be able to write off the full value of any eligible asset they purchase for their business. This government is acting in the national interest and making the right decisions and the right legislation to improve the economy and act in the national interest.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:25</span>):  After everything we saw in the banking royal commission, I am shocked to be standing here defending the current consumer protections from being watered down. Sadly, the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Supporting Economic Recovery) Bill 2020 is yet another case of this coalition government conducting a review and then doing the exact opposite of what that review recommended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia was horrified—I know I certainly was—at what it heard from that royal commission: unscrupulous behaviour by financial institutions that were hurting local people, saddling consumers with debt they knew they couldn't afford and destroying lives. It was more than heartbreaking; it was absolutely devastating, and it should have been a catalyst for strong action to strengthen consumer protections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 1.1 of the royal commission—yes, that's right, recommendation 1.1—said that responsible lending obligations should not be amended:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NCCP Act should not be amended to alter the obligation to assess unsuitability.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the very first recommendation. Treasury's own submission to the royal commission noted that appropriate responsible lending laws could enhance, rather than detract from, macroeconomic outcomes—that they make the system stronger, not weaker. But what does this bill here today do? It is not only attempting to alter responsible lending obligations; it's attempting to remove them from most consumer credit leases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a nutshell, this bill will shift the responsibility from lenders to borrowers, reducing protections for borrowers in the event credit decisions are made on the basis of incorrect information. These laws work to ensure loans are affordable, not unsuitable, for the customer. In other words, they make sure that people in desperate financial circumstances don't get themselves into a situation where they have borrowed more than they can possibly afford to repay. This bill is a direct contradiction of the Hayne report's recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot comprehend why the government is looking to do this after everything we have learned from and seen throughout the royal commission process. It's a betrayal of every witness, of every Australian who has had their life devastated by irresponsible lending. More than that, it is dangerous and will have shocking consequences for so many vulnerable people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Consumer Credit Protection Bill was introduced by Labor in 2009 to ensure lenders had a set of responsible lending obligations to abide by. They mean credit providers have to make reasonable inquiries about a customer and assess whether a credit product will be suitable for them. This applies to things like mortgages, personal loans, payday loans, car loans and credit cards. They are flexible and scalable, depending on the circumstances, and they are vital to ensuring we have a stable financial system. Bad debt is bad for everyone—bad for individuals, bad for the economy. Some academics have even gone so far as to say these changes could lead to financial instability or a debt crisis when interest rates begin to rise, which they inevitably will. It's dangerous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Household debt is at historic highs. In May 2020 Fitch Ratings reported that household debt in Australia was at 186.8 per cent of disposable income—one of the highest levels among AAA rated countries. It is a threat to our economic and financial stability. What I want to know is: why is the government doing this? House prices are booming. I know they certainly are on the South Coast. Only yesterday our local newspaper, the <span style="font-style:italic;">South Coast Register</span>, posted an article which showed that Callala Beach in Jervis Bay has risen to No. 3 in Australia's fastest price growth for small towns. The median house price rose by 14.1 per cent in the 12 months to December 2020.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWL" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CLARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blaxland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  Bert Collins was born in 1916, the year after the Anzacs landed at Gallipoli; the year that they arrived on the killing fields of the Western Front; and the same year that the Labor Party tore itself apart over conscription back here at home. That was the year that Bert was born, the youngest child of Florence and Maurice. His dad, Maurice, was a bootmaker, and Bert kind of followed his dad into the clothing game. When he was 16, Bert got a job at Farmers department store—what we now know as Myer—and he worked there for most of the next 50 years. As a young bloke, though, Bert's real passion was dancing. He was a great dancer. He was a ballroom dancer. He won lots of competitions with the woman who would end up sweeping him off his feet, Peggy Harmon. I kind of imagine Bert's life back in those days as a bit like a Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers movie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that all changed when the war came, when Bert did what so many other young men did—what my own grandfathers did. He signed up and got shipped off to New Guinea to fight the Japanese. Bert was one of the lucky ones because he made it back, and after the war he went back to the same department store, but he never forgot his mates. Every Anzac Day you could reliably find Bert on George Street in Sydney, marching with his regiment, marching for the mates who couldn't—the ones who never came home and the ones we've lost since. And he's still doing it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a few days time, Bert will turn 105. He is one of the oldest surviving members of the greatest generation. He's also the oldest member of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, the SDA—he's still a member; he's been a member now for about 90 years—and he is also the oldest living member of the great Australian Labor Party. And he's my mate. I'm lucky to have him. We're all lucky to have him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He's a gentle soul. When he turned 100, I asked him, 'What's the secret to a long life?' He said, 'Don't eat too much, and be nice to everyone.' That's good advice for all of us, particularly in this building. He's a tough old bugger. He had a heart attack and survived that. He had a stroke and survived that. Recently he got stage 4 metastatic melanoma, and he's beaten that. A bit over a week ago he fell over, and he's been in hospital, but he's okay. He got discharged from hospital today and, as I speak, he's just got back home. He still lives at home, in Bankstown, on his own. Peggy has gone. She died more than 20 years ago. Only photos on the mantelpiece of them dancing still remain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year Bert didn't get to march on the Anzac parade on George Street. There was no march. It was just one of the many things that COVID took from us. But it's back this year, and so too will Bert be. It's going to be a smaller parade this year. At this point, it's likely that only about 500 veterans will be able to march. But Bert will be one of them, marching for the same mates he's been marching for now for over 75 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A bit later this year, Bert will also finally receive life membership of the party that he so dearly loves. He joined a bit late. He joined after he retired at the age of 65. But he always voted Labor and still does. He voted for John Curtin. He voted for Ben Chifley. He voted for Whitlam. He voted for Hawke. He voted for the local boy, Paul Keating. He voted for Rudd and Gillard. And he promises me that he's not done yet. He's determined to live to see another Labor government, and I hope so too. So happy birthday, my old friend.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="274506" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHARMA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  We passed some sombre milestones this week around the world in our experience with COVID-19. In the United States half a million people have now lost their lives because of COVID-19, and in the United Kingdom the figure is 120,000 deaths caused by COVID-19.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, of course, we too have suffered during this pandemic. I think the figure for Australia is 909 deaths on the last count. Of course every one of those is a tragedy and worth mourning, but I think we'd have to say that we have been very fortunate compared with other countries around the world. If we look at what our death toll would have been on a proportionate basis if it had been a similar rate to that in the United States or the United Kingdom, we would have had something in the order of 40,000 deaths. So to have had fewer than 1,000 is really a testament to good management on the part of the federal government, state governments of both political persuasions and the Australian community, first and foremost, which has taken the measures, withstood the hardships, observed the social-distancing restrictions, listened to the doctors, listened to the experts and helped to keep us all safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the vaccine now being rolled out, I think we can look forward to a better future. I've been pleased to see how quickly the vaccine has been rolled out, with 1,600 doses on the first day, 6,000 doses on the second day and 10,000 doses on the third day. Seventy-one aged-care facilities have now been reached across Australia and, as the health minister informed the parliament just earlier today, there have now been 28 days of no community transmission of COVID-19 in Australia. This is at a time when there were 430,000 new cases of COVID-19 overnight. Zero community transmission in Australia for 28 days is remarkable. We have the Pfizer vaccine being rolled out and the AstraZeneca vaccine has also been approved by the TGA. Production of the AstraZeneca vaccine will soon start in Australia. There is still a long road ahead, but I think we can be pleased with how we've managed the health aspects of this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this crisis has really been twin crises—a health crisis and an economic crisis. On the economic side, this is a global shock of a scale, order and magnitude that we have not seen since the Great Depression. It's a global contraction in the order of 4.5 per cent of world GDP, some 40 times larger in size than the global financial crisis. In Australia too, of course, our economy has suffered, our workers have suffered and our businesses have suffered. Our GDP contracted by seven per cent in the June quarter. In that quarter we had 1.3 million Australians who either lost their jobs or had their hours reduced to zero. But through programs like JobKeeper, JobSeeker, cash injections for small business, instant asset write-offs, HomeBuilder or any number of other programs—loss carry-back provisions—we have seen the Australian economy make a remarkable recovery. In the six months between March and September we had about $70 billion go out the door through JobKeeper assistance, at the time supporting just under half of Australian businesses and almost a third of Australian workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, since that time, jobs have really come back. At the end of December we had 2.1 million workers across 500,000 businesses graduate off JobKeeper. In the last four months we've had 350,000 jobs created; in the month of January alone there were 59,000 jobs. Unemployment has fallen from 6.6 per cent to 6.2 per cent and, of the 1.3 million Australians who lost their jobs or had their hours reduced to zero at the start of this crisis, 94 per cent are now back at work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had our AAA credit rating affirmed just this week by Fitch's rating agency; Australia is now one of only nine countries around the world with a AAA credit rating from all three ratings agencies. As Fitch said at the time, Australia has weathered the pandemic well compared with its peers, and Australia's labour market appears to be on a stable path to recovery, supported by the JobKeeper program. We now have consumer and business confidence at pre-pandemic levels and we have investment spending and business confidence at pre-pandemic levels. As the RBA governor said just a few weeks back, the bounce back has been stronger and earlier than expected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a long way to go, but the strong management through the crisis has also given us the bandwidth to manage other issues. In the time remaining, I want to reflect on the passage of our signature digital platforms legislation through the parliament this week. This really is a landmark piece of microeconomic reform, managing the digital platforms that are the utilities and railroads of our day to make sure they continue to act for the public benefit.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  Each year, I rise in this parliament to honour the lives of women who have died in the past year through acts of violence, often by someone known to them. Tonight, I stand to honour and pay my respects to the 55 women who died last year. This equates to more than one violent death every week in 2020. Regrettably, the actual number is likely to be much higher, as the list is limited to deaths that have been publicly reported.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The confronting reality for so many women during the coronavirus pandemic is that they were trapped in their homes with their abusers. In July, a survey by the Australian Institute of Criminology revealed that almost 10 per cent of Australian women in a relationship had experienced domestic violence during the COVID-19 crisis. Two-thirds of those women said that the attacks started or became worse during the pandemic.

In the year 2021, we have already seen five women lose their lives as a result of violence. I don't want to stand here every year reciting the names of women who have been violently murdered, but I will because each and every one of them must be remembered. Their deaths cannot be in vain. We have to stop violence against women and children, and we need to do it urgently.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282983" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SIMMONDS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:45</span>):  I'm sure you will agree with this, Mr Speaker. How good is Queensland, and how good is my home city of Brisbane? I rise today, as a proud Queenslander and a proud Brisbane resident, to speak about the exciting news that Brisbane is leading the bid for the 2032 Olympic Games. And why wouldn't the International Olympic Committee mark Brisbane as one of their top picks? My home city has the perfect climate, it has infrastructure ready to support an influx of tourists in 2032 and it has the ability to spread the games between different locations in our region and in our state. Australia, with its remarkable success in managing the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis, is in the perfect position to deliver a fantastic Olympic Games in 2032. While other countries are still experiencing high rates of COVID-19, lockdowns and economic stress, Australia is well and truly on the road to recovery and able to show the International Olympic Committee that we are up to this most important task.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we learned that Brisbane in the box seat to win the bid for the 2032 Summer Olympics, the Games of the 35th Olympiad. As I said, our plan is for this to be spread right across the south-east region, creating opportunities in regional centres, as well as Logan, Scenic Rim, Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Ipswich and Redlands. We already have the capacity to support such an undertaking. The Brisbane Lord Mayor, Adrian Schrinner, is very proud to chair the South-East Queensland Council of Mayors, where the mayors of the entire South-East Queensland region are able to get together and coordinate on a variety of different occasions and issues. But they are all passionate about supporting this important bid for the 2032 Summer Olympic Games.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John Coates, President of the Australian Olympic Committee, remarked today that it is the first time the International Olympic Committee has shown interest in a region rather than a single city, and it's because we have so much to offer. We not only have the capital city of Brisbane but we have the beaches of the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast, and out to the beautiful mountain and rural areas of the Scenic Rim.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that one of the reasons we are in the box seat is that the Olympic Committee are looking for existing structures as well as the ability to provide any further infrastructure. We already have a lot of the infrastructure that we would need to host the games. Having held the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast, we know that the existing infrastructure is there to be utilised. By combining all of our resources in the South-East Queensland region, we're able to showcase a variety of infrastructure that's already in place. But, of course, we wouldn't let the opportunity pass without a bid for some extra infrastructure out of the state government, out of the federal government and out of local councils—all of us working in conjunction to provide that extra infrastructure which could create jobs and be a significant economic boost for our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Adrian Schrinner, also spoke today about his focus on the transport infrastructure needed to deliver these games. Having served as a Brisbane City councillor, I know a little something about Lord Mayor Schrinner's passion for reducing congestion; for delivering infrastructure, like the Metro project, which is going to revolutionise transport in Brisbane; and for getting Brisbane residents home to their families sooner and more safely. This would be just another way that we could help achieve that, by delivering infrastructure that not only brought a brilliant Olympic Games to the city of Brisbane and to the region but also had long-lasting infrastructure benefits and congestion-busting benefits for Brisbane residents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity to commend Lord Mayor Schrinner for his work on getting this bid together and helping to coordinate it, as well as the previous lord mayor, Graham Quirk, who I know is also integral behind the scenes. I've been fortunate enough to work with them both, and there are no two more passionate advocates of Brisbane City than those two gentlemen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that Lord Mayor Schrinner is bang-on about is the opportunity that this bid for 2032, if we secure the games, would have to showcase Brisbane and the region to the world. I was in Brisbane City Council when we hosted the G20 Leaders' Summit. The amount of attention that our city garnered from having the likes of Angela Merkel and Barack Obama in our city, and the way we were able to leverage that and sell Brisbane to the world as a place where global leaders meet, was an incredible opportunity to be replicated as part of the bid for the 2032 Games. The opportunity for us to be in the box seat for the bid is great for Brisbane residents and great for delivering infrastructure in Brisbane, and it will be a great boon for Australia. It's a feather in our cap for how well we have handled COVID-19. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="263547" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  This time tomorrow the federal government will hold in their hands the final report of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. This time tomorrow the Morrison government will know just how badly they have failed older Australians in aged care. This time tomorrow the government will have been given another report card outlining an aged-care sector rife with neglect and abuse. The government will pretend to be shocked by this report—and it is truly shocking—but the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government have known about the serious failings in aged care for seven years and they have not done anything. They have overseen $1.7 billion in cuts, the death of nearly 11,000 older Australians while waiting for home care in the past year, 685 aged-care deaths from coronavirus, chronic understaffing and malnutrition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission's interim report into aged care painted a truly dark picture of providers putting profit before vulnerable people and it revealed just how terrible things truly are. The commission heard that every week 50 Australians living in aged care are sexually assaulted. It heard stories about Australians living in aged care with ants crawling across their open wounds. It heard that 20 per cent of Australians living in aged care are receiving substandard care. Now we know that about 50 per cent of those living in aged care are malnourished.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These examples only scratch the surface. There are serious issues facing this vital sector and this government has so far failed to act. The human cost of this inaction is horrific. No-one has faith in the aged-care system any more. Daughters and sons fear placing their parents and loved ones in aged care and there is the fear that one day we may each face some such substandard care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me share with you two stories of the human cost in my electorate. Before I do I want to emphasise and thank the aged-care workers who have been on the front line during COVID caring for our older and most vulnerable citizens. Responsibility for the ills besetting the aged-care sector rests with the federal government, not with the workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jane from Grovedale suffers from rheumatoid arthritis. Her partner suffered a stroke as a younger person and then again more recently. After the second stroke, Jane's partner needed to relocate to Canberra to be closer to family support. As a result of these events and Jane's condition, she's had to move into a caravan on her daughter's property. When Jane applied for a home-care package she was assessed over the phone. Jane needs housing, physiotherapy and hydrotherapy. Jane needs a government that does give a toss. Instead, Jane got hostile bureaucracy under instruction from a government looking to pinch pennies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to bear in mind that the people receiving care aren't the only victims. The way the system is designed hurts the workforce too. Paul is a registered nurse with over 30 years experience. He emailed me the other day to tell me that his employer is neglecting its duty of care, that staff are grossly under-resourced and that residents of the facility are seriously suffering. There have been ongoing breaches of infection control onsite during the catastrophic COVID pandemic, putting the staff and residents at huge risk. Staff have no hope. They have lost hope that anything will improve. Many who could get employment elsewhere have. The following is a direct quote from Paul. He said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">This organisation has me gobsmacked, as I have never seen such cost-cutting and staffing deficits. Here we are in a worldwide pandemic and there is one cleaner to care for the whole facility. I've seen the cleaner need to go into the kitchen to help them out too. Therefore, no cleaning gets done at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The registered nurse on night duties is expected to wash, dry and fold all the linen for the day as well as nursing duties. Carers and nurses are overstretched and inadequate care is provided to residents. They are also expected to clean rooms. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Management is only concerned with money, not at all concerned with care. </span>

We used to dig up gold, then we dug up coal, then iron ore, and now we dig up everything from lithium to dinosaur fossils. Digging up things and selling them overseas has made us rich, it made us the only member of the OECD that didn't go into recession in the global financial crisis and, significantly, it is one of the only things maintaining our relationship with China. Mining has made us rich quick. And when the colonies were finding their feet a few centuries ago, we famously rode to economic prosperity through wool exports, whale products and other primary resources. We're really good at digging, harvesting, producing and sending it overseas to make it into something useful. But isn't it time we matured and applied our intelligence to expand our secondary manufacturing capabilities?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be clear: I'm not seeking unfettered building of factories or protectionist policies to make them viable. I recognise our high wages, which make our quality of life so high, also leave us very disadvantaged when attracting manufacturing in Australia. The car industry showed us how not to do it. Manufacturing right-hand drive cars in a country with a small population and surrounded by left-hand drive countries was never going to make it long term. And reliance on government subsidies simply isn't viable. We need to work smarter, pick our battles and work within the industries where we already possess a competitive edge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not an outrageous idea, and we've done it to huge success already. Who would have thought just 15 years ago that we would have a homegrown whisky industry? From a standing start, we took some of the grain that we had been sending overseas for years, sent it to some talented distillers and now we are winning awards internationally and driving huge numbers of tourists to new parts of Tasmania and the regions. Wine is another example—an industry that, a few decades ago, was done as a local hobby in a world dominated by European wines is now a multibillion-dollar industry that employs thousands of Australians and is one of our biggest and best exports. When we want to add value to our raw materials, we do it really well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To go back to the example of wool, our wool is the best in the world—perhaps second only to our friends across the ditch. We send it to South-East Asia to make into cheap textiles, and that's fair enough. We also send it to Italy to make the world's best suits at a huge mark-up, which we buy back at exorbitant prices. What would it take to get that industry to Australia, where we could benefit from the high-end production? We have proven that we can drive local manufacturing when we need to, and when it's in our security interests. We build submarines in Adelaide because it is in the interest to build them locally. Other Defence contracts are locally led for the same obvious reason. But sovereign security is not only Defence spending. It's also economic, trade, health, food and water security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is expanding this need by focusing on driving medical production in Australia. This makes sense on a few fronts. Firstly, self-evidently, in 2021 there is a competitive edge for any country that can design and manufacture their own vaccines, but, also, it's exactly the sort of high-tech STEM-based manufacturing job that we really can do well. We have great universities, great hospitals and well-regulated public health networks. We have the experience and capacity to run high-end clinical trials; however, we must do more to get Australians at the cutting edge of medical science by getting more clinical trials based here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The maturing of a country is not dissimilar to the maturing of an individual. There are distinct parallels: as we grow in time we accept responsibility for our own personal security and become responsible for earning money. We all mature, develop, diversify our interests and become self-sufficient. Is it time we accepted our coming of age and entered the next stage of our national development? We must be able to defend ourselves, provide for ourselves and not be dependent on others.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  Since this government was elected, Australia has become more corrupt. It's fallen in global rankings. You don't have to believe it from me; these are independently assessed league tables that measure all of the countries in the world for corruption through the Corruption Perceptions Index. Transparency International Australia's independent assessment shows that in 2012—the time of the last measure before the government came to office—we were the seventh least corrupt country in the world. In the eighth year of this government, we've slipped down those tables and we're now sitting at 11th. We actually came up one last year, but not because anything got any better; it was because Iceland got worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the eighth year of the Liberal government, despite this, we've still got no national integrity commission. The government at every turn have stalled, they've opposed, they've dissembled, they've dodged and they've weaved. It's no wonder, though, when you think about the list of rorts, waste and corruption that they're trying to hide. I'll read out some comments from former Liberal Party leader John Hewson. He's pointed out that the government is cheating on expenses and electoral allowances; the bending of entitlement rules using charter and VIP aircraft, from Bronwyn Bishop's helicopter to Mathias Cormann's VIP aircraft to campaign for a new job; the rorting of grants for party political advantage, like sports rorts, regional jobs rorts and community safety rorts we've now learnt of, from 'VolderRort' himself; paying $30 million for the Western Sydney Airport land deal, which was only worth $3 million; the stacking of COVID-19 recovery advisory groups with Liberal Party mates and vested interests; and the politicisation and erosion of the Public Service, appointing the Prime Minister's mates to all the best jobs. But worse than doing nothing is the attack that the government are making on the one strong independent watchdog that exists today in the system: the independent Auditor-General.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Auditor-General scrutinises the executive on behalf of the parliament and people of Australia, ensuring value for money and ethical, efficient and effective expenditure of taxpayer funds. By the end of the forward estimates there will have been, since this government was elected, a 22.1 per cent cut, in real terms, to the funding of the Auditor-General. That's analysis which has been published by the Parliamentary Library. We learnt last Friday, hearing directly from the Auditor-General, of the true impact of those cuts. We're about to see a drop in the number of performance audits that the Auditor-General can complete, from an average of about 52 a year before the government came to office to 36 a year. That means sports rorts, airport land rorts and billions of dollars of Defence blowouts will also not be uncovered and revealed. The public sector should be subject to that kind of scrutiny. Taxpayers should expect it. Even more concerning, perhaps, was the Auditor-General saying in public that he was now 'uncomfortable' with the level of risk tolerance that he was forced to bear in financial statement auditing because of the government cuts. It's about time they restored the funding to the Auditor-General and introduced a national integrity commission.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  I rise to acknowledge International Women's Day 2021, on 8 March. This year's theme is 'women lead'. When I was a young girl, Margaret Thatcher had just become Prime Minister. We could almost literally hear the glass ceiling shatter. Margaret Thatcher may have broken the glass ceiling, but she didn't give a road map to those who followed. She didn't tell us how we would navigate the massive social changes that were afoot, changes that would alter the fundamental fabric of society and changes that were for the better but that have also come at a cost. As recent events tell us, those costs still need to be addressed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the advent of the pill, women were empowered to control their biological destiny. This meant women could do things that previous generations could not even imagine. Women are now achieving through all levels of society. Women are the drivers of change. However, recent events in this place have highlighted that we still have a long way to go with regard to ensuring this place, like every other place, is a safe place for women—a place free from the risk of violence. We need to do better. We have a collective responsibility to change the culture here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both sides of the aisle want to attract the best and brightest from across Australia to work here at the heart of our democracy and ensure a broad representation of society. We want the women and men of parliament to be proud of the way in which they serve their country, not frightened by the bad or even criminal behaviour of others. This can only be achieved by ensuring a safe and professional workplace that matches the best practices of every other workplace in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the women of the past who have paved the way for me to stand here. I am proud to be amongst those who seek to change the world to make it safer for women. Around the world, we need to work together to protect, respect and reflect on the issues that affect women. There is so much more to do, but there is hope that the warm winds of change are now howling down the corridors of power. We all need to be the change we want to see. Happy International Women's Day!</span>

There is no medicine and no emergency services. The water is not clean, the environment is unhealthy and the food is worse. The longer he stays, the worse it will be.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a statement from Michael Phuong Minh Nguyen, a former inmate, about the Australian national Mr Van Kham Chau, who is currently in prison in Vietnam. Accordingly, I take this opportunity to raise my concerns regarding Mr Chau's continued incarceration and welfare, particularly given the restrictions that have been imposed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. I'm advised by Mr Chau's lawyers that all prisoner visits have been suspended and Mr Chau has not received a visit from the Australian consular office since October last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Chau is 71 years of age. He lives locally, in the Bankstown region. His health is in decline. He's been to hospital twice since his detainment in Vietnam. I understand that he has also faced difficulty receiving his regular medicines and has been forced to endure long hours of hard labour in prison, with very limited food. He is in very poor health. As a consequence, these conditions have taken a significant physical and mental toll on his wellbeing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I personally spoke to Michael Nguyen. He is a citizen of the USA. He has advised me that he was convicted under section 109 of the Vietnamese Criminal Code in 2018. Like Mr Chau, he was sentenced to 12 years jail; however, Mr Nguyen was released in October 2020 following representations from the US State Department. The case of Mr Nguyen demonstrates that, with the appropriate support, there may be some willingness on behalf of the Vietnamese authorities to afford Mr Chau, the Australian citizen, the same outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the strong strategic relationship with Vietnam that has been developed under this government—which was only recently reinforced by the Prime Minister, when he publicly referred to Vietnam's Prime Minister as 'his very close friend'—surely we can do more in the case of Mr Chau? Therefore, I call on the Australian government to take all possible steps to secure Mr Chau's welfare and ensure that Mr Chau can safely return to his family here in Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:08</span>):  For the last three decades, with two exceptions, I, like many other members in this place, have attended local Anzac Day services on 25 April. Those two exceptions were when I was representing the government in 2015 at the centenary of 1915 on the Western Front and, of course, last year, when services were restricted or, indeed, not held.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of those places which I attend is Templestowe. On the war memorial monument at Templestowe, in the stone, are etched the names of 42 young Australians who went to the First World War. They were farmers, orchardists, labourers and storekeepers—42 young men from a population of what was then a rural area of probably no more than 500 or 600 people in total. Some of those names are still familiar to people in Menzies, because they're the names of the great orchardists of a century ago—names like Aumann, Chivers and Williamson. Of those 42, 13 never returned. They lie buried in the gullies of Gallipoli or in Flanders fields or in some unknown places, lost forever to kith and kin. That, of course, was said to be the war to end all wars, yet two decades later another great war broke out in which many more young Australians from that district, like from all over Australia and New Zealand, joined in that great battle to fight another war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mention these things in the context of the upcoming Anzac Day, because there are suggestions that this Anzac Day there should be restrictions and, indeed, that the traditional march from the Melbourne CBD to the Shrine of Remembrance on St Kilda Road should be abandoned. I urge the Victorian government and the RSL and all others involved to hold that march and to hold these commemorations of those who gave their lives and made the sacrifices. Are we saying to young Australians and their families that the sacrifices of those men who fought and were killed in the muddy, shelled trenches of the Western Front, the arduous Owen Stanley Ranges, the searing deserts of North Africa, the infected swamps of Asia, the skies over Britain, the Coral Sea and elsewhere—men and, indeed, women, including the nurses who were executed off Singapore during the Second World War—no longer mean enough that we go out on Anzac Day and commemorate their service? I believe that those people would want it. I believe their families would have wanted it. As I said, I urge the authorities in Victoria to enable Anzac Day celebrations, including the march, to go ahead.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:11</span>):  Early voting is now open in Western Australia for the state election on 13 March. We're expecting that, due to the ongoing COVID crisis, more people than ever will be voting early at polling booths and through the post. While the Leader of the Opposition in WA claims that we shouldn't let WA Labor have total control—a ridiculous comment when that's exactly what the Liberals have had whenever they have been in government—I want to make sure that my community has a few facts. Let me share with you some information about our local state colleagues in the electorate of Burt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's Dr Tony Buti, a local legend who is getting our community moving in the state seat of Armadale. His focus on improving social and educational outcomes for our community knows no bounds. There's Chris Tallentire, who is working hard to clean up the waterways in Thornlie. It's a real passion of his; he has been working on environmental protection for years. There's Terry Healy in Southern River. As a former teacher, he is focused on making sure that our local schools have the best facilities possible and students get access to a good education. There's Yaz Mubarakai in Jandakot, who is a small business owner who understands what is important to local business and our rapidly growing suburbs. And there's Hugh Jones, our candidate in Darling Range, who has spent much of his life defending our country serving in the Navy and is putting his hand up to represent our Darling Range community. They make up Mark McGowan's local WA Labor team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's now time for every Western Australian to ask themselves: during a once-in-a-century pandemic and global economic uncertainty, who do I trust to guide our state through these unprecedented times? The answer is: a government that makes jobs and health its top priorities, that is dedicated to fairness, opportunity and creating prosperity across this great state, and a government that will keep WA strong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Morrison government has failed to bring our nation together, deciding on a strategy of division and outright partisan assault on Labor premiers, Mark McGowan and his team have done a fantastic job of uniting Western Australia. They have successfully managed a strong border that kept Western Australians safe, even when Scott Morrison and his Attorney-General from Western Australia, Christian Porter, decided to side with Clive Palmer to try and bring down the border, which would have left Western Australians less safe. Western Australians know it's the WA Labor Party that's been on their side, keeping the state safe and keeping the economy strong not just for Western Australia but for the entire nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The past year has brought some of the most difficult challenges we have ever faced and, as a state, we have responded in the only way we know how—we've stuck together, we have supported each other and we have risen to the challenges as only Western Australians can. That's what has kept our state safe and strong, and only the team of Mark McGowan and WA Labor will keep that moving forward.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:14</span>):  I rise today to talk about the passing of a giant in our community—in her heyday a symbol of modernity, an undisputed icon and a familiar face to everyone in Ryde and almost everyone in Sydney. Next week the once mighty Ryde Civic Centre is being torn down after 60 years at the very heart of top Ryde. In that time it has housed the offices of the council, the Ryde Public Library and the community hall, which has been home to musical performances and thousands of citizenship services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has had quite a history. Ryde in the 1960s was a novel place for such a striking building, where parts that are now new suburbs were market gardens, growing fruit and vegetables and our locally developed Granny Smith apples. At the time it was built it was the tallest building in Sydney, although its position on the top of the hill certainly helped. Praised for its striking modernistic looks by many, it was derided as an eyesore by those who didn't live in the area and were jealous. I would recommend to any who believe the latter to have a chat with John Booth, the proud mayor who commissioned the building back in the 1960s. John Booth led the council in deciding to establish Macquarie University and set aside land for our leading medical hub in Macquarie Park, and he brought the 2000 Olympic Games to Ryde as the proprietor of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Weekly Times</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, the years have taken their toll and concrete cancer has meant that it has been standing empty for the last couple of years. But land at the heart of top Ryde with views to the Blue Mountains and to the city was never going to remain idle for long. Soon after the building's destruction, a new centre will rise from the rubble. The New Heart of Ryde will make a significant, positive contribution to the Ryde town centre and will be centred on the Edna Wilde Performance Centre. This replaces the old community hall, where countless people have stood at their citizenship ceremonies eagerly anticipating the promise of new life in our community. Love it or not, our civic centre for decades has been part of the landscape and the cultural identity of the area. There will be a hole in the skyline from next week, but the memories that we have all formed from inside its walls and from the shadow will ensure this iconic modernistic building will live on in our memories. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  Thirty-eight people died from COVID-19 at the Epping Gardens aged-care home last year. This was a tragedy but, much worse than that, a preventable tragedy. My thoughts today go out to the many families who are still grieving the loss of loved ones. An independent report last year found that frontline workers hired to fill staffing gaps at the nursing home had little experience in aged care. It found poor infection control. Inadequate emergency planning and deficient leadership at the facility were also significant factors in these tragic deaths.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen many revelations in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Age</span> newspaper about the owners of the company, including that the director and co-owner of the company in ownership of the facility, Peter Arvanitis, was very recently granted an exemption to travel to Greece, apparently for essential business. As I understand it, this outbreak at Epping Gardens remains under investigation by WorkSafe and also by the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been listening to family members who have lost loved ones, and I still remember the appalling scenes in such difficult circumstances at the time of the outbreak, when people were unable to get close to it for other COVID-safety reasons, and the incredible anxiety felt then and still felt now by family members. I acknowledge the extraordinary leadership of my state parliamentary colleague Bronwyn Halfpenny in working to keep families connected and to gain their confidence in a government that was on their side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remain deeply concerned that Heritage Care Epping Gardens is not fit to hold accreditation as an aged-care operator. And what is the point, fundamentally, of a regulator if they never use their powers to enforce higher standards or to punish inadequate operation? What is the point of a regulator that does not stand up and protect our elderly Australians? The aged-care royal commission is due to announce its findings at the end of this week, I understand. I look forward to examining those recommendations, but there are things we know already. We've seen the interim report, titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>. We've seen the evidence of what happened at Epping Gardens and other facilities in Melbourne's northern suburbs, which has had such a catastrophic impact on so many lives. When it comes to Heritage Care Epping Gardens, it's clear this facility needs to be better managed. We owe it to those who lost their lives to learn from this tragedy and never see it repeated. We owe it to them to do better as a country and to better protect and maintain the dignity of our elderly in residential aged care.</span>

The benefit of hindsight, the lapsing of time, allows you to think of such people and realise how blessed you are as an individual. It is humbling to have those people, like angels at times, sweep in just when you need them most. I rise in this parliament of ours today to pay tribute to one such person. His name is Ian Perkin. Ian, sadly, recently passed away. He came into my life in 2012 and 2013 with such enthusiasm and support for some of my activities then. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The name Ian Perkin may not be one that we in the current crop of parliamentarians recognise all that quickly, but I can assure you that every parliamentarian who came here in the seventies and eighties knew the name Ian Perkin because he was such a successful and highly regarded business and economics journalist. He ended up becoming the bureau chief at <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>, here in the press gallery. He was the press secretary to Andrew Peacock at a very challenging time for the Liberal Party. He played a similar role for a captain of industry, Richard Pratt. He was a man who demonstrated loyalty, integrity and vision—forward-leaning vision about the future, no matter how old he became. I know he is going to be so dreadfully missed by his loved ones, the broader community and, indeed, the people of Buderim. In speaking with Kylie this morning, it was wonderful to at least pay my tributes to him to her, whom Ian left behind, together with their son, Oliver, and Ian's siblings, Greg, Philip and Wendy. To Oliver I say, 'Your dad was a giant of a man.'</span>

It was great to have the Minister for Veterans' Affairs come up to Darwin to take part in that very important commemoration. Next year is the 80th anniversary. In reflecting on those who have served, I note we have some extraordinary veterans in the NT. This year, 7 February was a big day—a happy day of celebration but also a sad day. We celebrated World War II veteran Charlie Parrott's 101st birthday. It was great to celebrate with Charlie and his friends and family. It's a massive milestone. He served our nation in the Second World War, joining up in 1939, and fought in North Africa and Greece. He fought in the Battle of Crete and was taken prisoner. His story of survival during those years and his journey to freedom is extraordinary. I can recommend his book, which is humbly titled <span style="font-style:italic;">An Aussie Nobody: The Story of an Ordinary Man in Extraordinary Circumstances</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But 7 February was also a sad day in that we lost World War II veteran Ronnie Chin. Ronnie was 95. He served with the Royal Australian Air Force during the Second World War. He was a lifetime member of the Chung Wah Society in Darwin, and he was a legend of the Darwin Buffaloes footy club. Ronnie made a huge contribution to our community, and the Chin family continue to make an outstanding contribution in Darwin in many, many fields. Rest in peace, Ronnie. As the Buffs say: 'Old Buffaloes never die; they simply fade away.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:26</span>):  Owning your own home is a goal that many Australians, particularly younger Australians, aspire to, but for many the idea that you can save a deposit for a home while working as an apprentice or in some other entry-level position seems fanciful. Today I'm here to tell young people in my electorate of Longman that owning your home is not as fanciful as you might believe. Through a combination of earning regular income, adopting sensible spending habits and taking advantage of government grants and initiatives, you could be walking through the front door of your own home sooner than you think. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government has a little-known scheme that can help working Australians save money for a deposit on their first home using their super fund. It's called the First Home Super Saver Scheme and it has been in place since July 2017. It works by allowing people who are saving for their first home to make voluntary contributions into their super fund, and these contributions can then be released to be used to buy a first home. The benefits of this are significant. Treasury estimates that this scheme can increase the deposit of a first home buyer by around 30 per cent compared with saving through a standard savings account. For a start, the contributions you make under the scheme are taxed at a discounted rate of 15 per cent, as opposed to being taxed at your marginal rate. The scheme also allows you to withdraw any earnings that you make on the super contributions—although it's important to note that the earnings aren't calculated at the same rate as the rest of your super; they are calculated using the rate known as the shortfall interest charge, which is currently around three per cent. It may seem low, but it's still higher than what you would get from interest on a savings account these days. Someone earning $65,000 a year who salary sacrifices $15,000 a year under the First Home Super Saver Scheme could, after two years, save around $5½ thousand more than if they saved through a standard savings account. The amount will vary, of course, depending on your income, how much you can sacrifice and the shortfall interest charge rate. On top of this, the federal government's $15,000 HomeBuilder grant is available until the end of March. My home state of Queensland also has a $15,000 first home owners grant available for a newly constructed home. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I completely understand that buying your first home is not easy these days and that it may seem like a distant dream for many, but with the right advice and by taking advantage of government initiatives like the super saver scheme and other grants this dream can become a reality. I can remember the joy and sense of accomplishment at buying my first home at the age of 21. It may have been a 110-square-metre box, with no carpets or curtains, but it was mine and it got me going. So, to all of you aspirational young people out there, I say: go for it. I am with you, and this government is with you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:29</span>):  On the HomeBuilder program, I've had a number of contractors and people involved in the home-building industry reach out to me. They are very concerned about this government's hard deadline by which builds must begin. In Bendigo, we have steady growth. Every year, we have new homes being built. But the HomeBuilder program caught many of them off guard, and there are now supply-chain issues. Usually builders stage their build throughout the year. This is smart. This ensures not only that the new homeowners have the time to get their savings and their payments worked out but also a continuous supply chain of work. It allows the suppliers and the tradies to have that continuous work, that continuous pipeline. But, because of the hard deadline that this government has imposed on when builds must start, everybody is racing to get started.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We simply don't have enough tradespeople on the ground. We don't have the supplies in our stores to get everybody started at once. Then a concern that the industry has is that all these homes will be built in bulk quickly and then there won't be work at the other end. They are calling on this government to have a softer, phased start line so that in regional areas they can ensure that the HomeBuilder program is rolled out over a longer period. We don't want to see a sugar hit and then no work, and that's what this government's program has been designed to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also a genuine concern about supplies, particularly supplies that are coming from overseas. This is an area where the government has simply dropped the ball. Whether it be building supplies or basic goods that our stores are selling, we have a problem with accessing supplies overseas and having them imported to Australia. Part of the problem is shipping. Our country has become so reliant on overseas vessels and overseas crews that we don't have a secure supply. We don't have Australian shipping to bring goods to our country. It is something that is a sovereign risk, and, right now, we need government to act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coronavirus is raging throughout the world; we know that. Many crews are Filipino or South-East Asian. They're not able to get onto the ships like they once did. This is an opportunity for us to ensure that we have supplies arriving in our country and that our supply chains are secure. We must return to a state where we actually have Australian ships, with healthy Australian crews, able to bring the goods that we need to the country.</span>

This is the single largest health and logistical effort in our nation's history, and I commend all the dedicated men and women who've got us to where we are today. It's been a remarkable effort.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to assure everyone in my electorate of Capricornia that a dose of the vaccine will be available to anyone who wishes to take it and that they won't have to travel to get it. I'm thrilled that the Morrison government has secured more than 150 million COVID vaccine doses, with over 50 million doses of AstraZeneca ordered, which will be manufactured in Melbourne. As we embark on this phase of the vaccine rollout, we will ensure that our fellow Australians within the priority groups who are most at risk of the virus will receive a vaccine first.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the first week of this initial rollout, about 80,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine are being released, and approximately 50,000 vaccines will be available for the states and territories to give to hotel quarantine workers, border workers and frontline healthcare workers. Importantly, 30,000 vaccines will also go to our aged-care and disability care residents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I've just outlined is just in the first week, in the first phase, of our national vaccine rollout. Under the Morrison government's plan, quarantine workers, border residents and aged-care residents are all on track to be vaccinated by April. Our government will follow the expert medical advice that underpins this vaccine rollout. Every Australian can have full and absolute confidence that the vaccines have been subject to extensive assessment by the TGA, because, after all, here in Australia we have the best health system, the best health standards and the best health professionals in the world. I'll certainly be rolling up my sleeve when it's my turn to get a COVID shot. As the Prime Minister demonstrated when he got his, he is not asking anyone to do something that he is not prepared to do himself. In further developments I also wanted to mention that the Department of Health has approved over 4,600 general practices to participate in the rollout across the country. They have stepped up in huge numbers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the fight against COVID-19, Australians have so much to be proud of. Currently, there are fewer than 50 active cases, in a nation of more than 25 million people. It has been extraordinary so far. But the fight isn't over yet. We need to continue to stick together. We need to continue to follow the expert medical advice. The next crucial step is to get the COVID vaccination. The vaccine is safe, it is effective, it will protect people and it will protect your loved ones. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  The opportunities that come from our experience with drought, bushfire and COVID-19 need to inspire our efforts to recover, renew and rebuild. The challenge now is to build on that and cement those experiences into our long-term response. The pandemic has shifted the way people want to live and work—just talk to any regional real estate agent. Demand for homes to buy or rent or land to build on is through the roof. This is outstripping supply. It creates opportunity but it also creates a housing crisis for the vulnerable members of our remote communities. Remote work, once a bumper sticker for entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, has become an Australian reality, and we've seen that spike on one of the slowest internet services in the world, with Australia being ranked 61st. Imagine what we could achieve for regional people and businesses if we had an NBN that could keep pace with our vision and ambitions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Previously, regional development has happened in a disorganised and ad hoc manner. The numbers speak for themselves. Sixty-four per cent of Australians live in one of our big cities, yet you talk to those families and many dream of living a life with more space, less congestion and closer connections to communities and the environment. Job opportunities, internet speeds, mobile phone reception and a lack of housing prevent people from leaving the big smoke. What 2021 and the years ahead require is an all-of-government approach to regionalisation, tying together the efforts and responsibilities of local, state and federal governments. The federal government could and should be playing a leadership role in the development of our regions. Many regional communities already know what's required; they just need the backing of the different levels of government to make it happen. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week, I attended Merimbula's town summit, organised by the Merimbula Chamber of Commerce. The summit was another powerful example of leadership, unity and cooperation that is so critical for our future. Property and business owners, government agencies, politicians of all persuasions, community leaders and service clubs contributed to developing a 10-point plan, outlining projects and ideas to enhance the town for residents, visitors and investors. The summit highlighted the perennial catch 22 of regional development: people won't relocate to the regions without improved infrastructure and jobs, but governments won't make investments without the population to support them. It's an equation and a way of thinking that is broken and has unfairly disadvantaged country towns and people for decades. Working together, following the example-setting Merimbula, let's develop a renewal plan for Australia that starts in our regions. The number of people might not be there to justify the investment, but, when you commit to the end goal, when you commit to building and strengthening Australia as a whole, the business case stacks up and the true power of regional development is released. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr EVANS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Waste Reduction and Environmental Management</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:38</span>):  Now, more than ever, it's essential that different levels of government cooperate and work closely together to help drive Australia's economic recovery following the pandemic. So it's been very pleasing to work so closely with Brisbane City Council and the lord mayor on some key local projects that will be delivered by federal funding through the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program. In total, more than $40 million of federally supported infrastructure projects will soon be underway in Brisbane. These are a variety of shovel-ready projects that will make our local area better in so many ways—enhancing green space, safety and improving the Brisbane lifestyle we love so much. This is federal economic support being delivered at a local community level, which will support an additional 320 local jobs through 2021. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One example is that the residents of Windsor will benefit from a brand-new playground at the new Windsor Sports and Community Park. In Hamilton, the refurbishment of the town hall will significantly improve the facilities that are available for local community groups. In Paddington, the old substation building will benefit from $1½ million in repairs and refurbishments to improve the heritage conditions on the terraces and to make it fit for many of the local community groups that use it, like Hands On Art.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Brekkie Creek, lighting and greening upgrades will improve the green space amenity and safety. Plus, about 60 local sporting clubs and groups across Brisbane will benefit from a sports field lighting upgrade program. There are major road maintenance projects, as well as pavement resurfacing and the maintenance of major retaining walls, across so many locations in the city. Further funds will be invested in a bushland acquisition program. This is about securing land that supports native wildlife, flora and ecosystems, creating more conservation reserves across Brisbane to ensure everyone can continue to enjoy our natural environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another highlight is funding for wildlife corridors and safety infrastructure. We're talking about $700,000 worth of investments across Brisbane for things like glider and possum poles, underpass ledges and fauna movement infrastructure, installed in so many places across our great city. That both helps with wildlife conservation and improves driver safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I should also mention today's big announcement about Brisbane being the preferred location for the 2032 Olympics. This is one more very strong example of all levels of government working collaboratively to get amazing results, and good results as well as we look at the recovery after 2020. What's more, this will provide further opportunities in coming years for all levels of government to continue to collaborate, to keep working together, to ensure our region in South-East Queensland has the best infrastructure it possibly can.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265980" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  It's my great hope that we see real change in the aged-care sector with the long-awaited release of the report of the royal commission into aged care. The commission's interim report confirmed our worst fears that the aged-care system is a victim of neglect. I believe that we should have seen action on the issues that were raised in the interim report, because we are letting down older Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning there was another news story: an elderly man left in aged care, up on the roof in 40-degree weather, unattended for hours. His burns were so severe that he needed to be hospitalised. The sector will require change, and it will require increased funding. But I am loath for us as a parliament to write a blank cheque to a sector that has pushed back against scrutiny, change and regulation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, I introduced a bill that would require aged-care providers to disclose both their income and what they spend on food, medication, staff, training, accommodation and administration, to address how much is siphoned off to parent companies. Older Australians and their families deserve transparency, and I hope recommendations will require the opening of books so the government can properly determine how much it costs for quality care. The approach of 'the market will decide' has been a complete and utter failure in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is my hope that the report will talk about the sustainability of our residential care homes, particularly those in regional Australia. Recent analysis shows that three-quarters of them are losing money because they're small. They're often repurposed very old buildings—they were hospitals; they're now very small aged-care facilities—and they do not have the economies of scale that are enjoyed by very large inner metropolitan facilities that have hundreds upon hundreds of residents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's my hope that we will properly address the waiting times for people who need a home-care package. We are seeing too many people going to residential aged care prematurely because they have been left to languish waiting for a package and care at home. And then, when they do get care at home—if they're lucky enough; after, sometimes, a couple of years—they are losing up to 45 per cent of their home-care package to administration and management fees. In regional Australia many can't actually get anyone to come into the home and do that work. We need to fix this. It's a rort. It really is a rort.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I want to see change so that aged-care workers are valued, encouraged and supported with decent pay, training and development. I put on notice to the government that the community will not accept the royal commission's report sitting on a shelf and gathering dust, as so many royal commission reports have in the past. We need to ensure that the recommendations are acted upon urgently, because older Australians deserve so much better than what they have received with respect to aged care.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Customs, Community Safety and Multicultural Affairs</span>) (1<span class="HPS-Time">0:45</span>):  The 3rd of March this year marks World Wildlife Day and it is also the three-year anniversary of a great event, a crushing event, that I attended with Donalea Patman OAM, who is the founder of For The Love Of Wildlife. This event was all about crushing rhino horn and elephant ivory to, in fact, take the value out of this product. The most awful way of killing these most beautiful creatures is by putting cyanide in their drinking water, and I've seen horrendous videos of rhinos sleeping at night and having their ankles slashed. I called on the government at the time to ban these imports, and I congratulate and thank the Hon. Sussan Ley for making the decision to ban any imports into Australia of rhino horn and elephant ivory. This was also a recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, of which I was a member.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also thank Donalea for the work we did together to have a ban imposed on the importation of lion parts and trophies into Australia. We had young Australians travelling to places like South Africa, believing they were going to be nurturing a young lion cub to adulthood and then releasing them to the wild, when in fact they were released into a so-called 'conservation park' which was in actual fact a hunting park where the animals were just killed. Greg Hunt, the environment minister at the time, put that ban in place—and I again thank him so much for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, at the federal level, we have done the work, under the Liberal government, to ban the importation of elephant ivory, rhino horn and also African lion parts and trophies. But, when it comes to rhino horn and elephant ivory, we really need the states to do their bit and stop the sale of these products at the domestic level. This was put forward by Sussan Ley at the COAG meeting of ministers, and I and other members of parliament pushed for it strongly. In my role as <span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Customs, Community Safety and Multicultural Affairs</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">, I looked at the figures—we've made it a priority to detect wildlife coming into the country and also leaving A</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">ustralia—and this year there have</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles"> still been 11 seizures of elephant ivory and</span> 28 specimens. The good news for lions is that nothing has been seized for the last two years. With rhino horn, we're still seeing medicines coming in. We need the states to act, and act now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I come this morning after meeting with members of the Australian Myanmar community in the House today. They will be having a gathering in front of Parliament House at 12 o'clock today. I rise to speak on behalf of the Myanmar community that I represent, who have established their lives and their futures in the electorate of Lalor. I've spoken to them across the week. They are incredibly concerned about what's happening in Myanmar, their former home. To contextualise that, there are people living in my community who came here after the previous two situations like this, having fled the city after the 1988 deaths and destruction and are being triggered, if you like, reliving traumas. We heard again today of people who were young children in 1988. I know how concerned my local community are about their families back in Myanmar, but I also know how determined they are that Myanmar return to democracy. This transition has been long, over many decades, and we cannot concede in this place. Because there was a coup so recently, there will be a long, long journey. This country needs to stand with its citizens here from Myanmar. We need to stand with our neighbour. This country needs to take action. I say to the government: please review our military cooperation with Myanmar and assist the people who live here and those in Myanmar.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  I rise today to pay tribute to a marvellous, talented and much-loved Far North Queenslander. Former pearl diver Uncle Henry Gibson, better known as Seaman Dan, passed away peacefully late last year at the age of 92. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seaman Dan rose to national and international prominence at the age of 70, when he first laid down music tracks in the studio. He would go on to become a charismatic and consummate performer who blended traditional Torres Strait Islander and pearling songs with jazz, hula and blues. Seaman Dan's list of musical accolades are long, illustrious and thoroughly well deserved. In 2005, he received the Australia Council for the Arts Red Ochre Award for his outstanding contribution to the development and recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander arts and culture. In 2009, he received the Jimmy Little Lifetime Achievement Award at the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Music, Sport, Entertainment and Community Awards. In 2013, he received a Hall of Fame Award at the National Indigenous Music Awards in Darwin. In 2019, he was awarded the Grant McLennan Lifetime Achievement Award at the Queensland Music Awards. And the awards go on. Last year, Seaman Dan was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for significant service to music in the Indigenous community. Seaman Dan was also the oldest award winner in ARIA history, at 75, for his <span style="font-style:italic;">Perfect Pearl </span>album, and again at 80, for his album <span style="font-style:italic;">Sailing Home</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While Seaman Dan may no longer be with us, fortunately his beautiful music and smooth, crooning voice will be with us for eternity. He is a true Australian legend in every sense of the word. Seaman Dan is survived by his living children, Conchetta Mau, William Dan and Elvianna Dorante, his grandchildren, his great-grandchildren and even some great-great-grandchildren. I had the opportunity of travelling to Thursday Island to farewell Uncle Seaman Dan. It was a wonderful ceremony, a celebration of a fantastic and colourful life, but it was very sad to see him go. He was a good friend and somebody that I respected immensely. He taught me a hell of a lot about Torres Strait Island culture. I recall being there at different times with the Mill Sisters, singing along to Seaman Dan's music. In fact, at one stage it was suggested I might be the fourth Mill sister! Farewell, my old friend. May you rest in peace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  Four years ago I visited a patch of paddock on the grounds of St Thomas Aquinas and St Columba's and was told a beautiful garden would emerge. Well, sure enough, Springwood Community Garden has become a bountiful place. At the weekend, I watched the bees feasting on plants in the bee-and-butterfly bed in the permaculture garden. As he was there to open the garden four years ago, so Australia's favourite gardener, Costa Georgiadis, was there to celebrate the birthday. Manu, a budding permaculture student, who designed the garden—she described it as being an act of self-healing and opening a new future to her, as she now runs her own business—was there to witness its progress. Manu is the creator of Farm It Forward, another initiative, where private gardens are used by volunteers to grow produce. We also heard about the Edible Garden trail, which COVID interrupted. The hundreds of people gathered there, many of whom have worked on the garden over many years, couldn't help but be reminded about how good it feels to get your hands dirty and watch things grow. I also want to give a shout-out to Moochy Kids Family Day Care, who were there to raise funds for HeartKids, which supports the eight babies born every day with a heart defect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Getting your hands dirty—in fact, getting your hands muddy—was the order of the day out the back of the Katoomba headspace at the weekend, with Lis Bastian from the Big Fix continuing her work with young people in creating a permaculture garden. The barren space at the back of the headspace building has long been an eyesore, but Lis saw the potential for both training young people in permaculture and creating more private spaces at the centre where young people could hang out in that backyard. I was pleased to be able to lend a hand with the pond, edging it with rocks, although the kids and Lis had done the hard yards in digging and mulching the area. I have a renewed passion for cardboard when it comes to mulching now! It was also terrific to see the start of the worm farms. While this is a satellite headspace and it's not funded to provide full services, I have no doubt that the strong collaborative approach, which is always evident in the upper mountains, will ensure that it can offer a variety of touchpoints to connect kids to the centre. This garden is definitely one of those. What is concerning is that, in its first few months, 80 per cent of the young people who've come to the centre have reported suicide ideation, and that shows the very high need there and the high level of services still required for that area. We know the same services are needed in the Hawkesbury, where there is no headspace. It is absolutely urgent and crucial that a headspace be delivered for the Hawkesbury so that they get the benefits that we're seeing in the upper mountains.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with sadness that I conclude today by paying tribute to the late Jacqueline Anita Fetherstonhaugh, who, just short of her 90th birthday, passed away on 19 January 2021. Everyone knew her as Anita, a stalwart of the Hills community. She moved to the district in 1954, with her husband, Bob, and new baby, Wendy. Their family grew to include Kerrie, Robert and Trevor. She was a remarkable woman and a committed woman of faith. She was an active member of not only her local church and her children's schools but also the Hills history group, amongst several other groups. She volunteered her services to the Anglicare Retirement Villages Computer Club and the Parramatta Arthritis Group, and for 25 years she was also involved in the Self Help for Hard of Hearing group. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1964 Anita joined the Girl Guides support unit at Castle Hill, where she remained an active member of the Girl Guides. Anita was a founding member of the Hills Trefoil Guild in 1992, and received an award for 45 years membership in guiding. She volunteered for the Castle Hill branch of the Australian Red Cross for 21 years, where she served as secretary up until her death. She was also given a service award by the Red Cross for her outstanding contribution. She was nominated by the International Women's Day Committee to be included in the 100 years of active women in the Hills community service, and she was incredibly honoured to be recognised for her outstanding commitment. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We note her passing and remember that she contributed all of that in just one lifetime. I had the opportunity and pleasure to meet Anita on many occasions in my electorate. I remember her fondly. She was an amazing woman who gave so much. She made a great difference to the lives of so many groups that she had an impact on over so many years. I pass on our condolences and our community's love to her family and children.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COLLINS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  Australia Post recently announced, without adequate consultation, that it would end the delivery of perishable goods, abandoning our world-class producers in my home state of Tasmania. The Morrison government has since intervened, I understand, and this service that was going to end on 31 March is now going to end on 30 June. Whilst this extension is appreciated by primary producers in Tasmania, there is still a lot of angst and a lot of concern from these primary producers about how they're going to get their fresh perishable goods out of our home state when this service by Australia Post finishes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, I got another letter just this week, after it was raised in the local media last week, from another Tasmanian company that is very concerned that Australia Post only contacted it just last week—just last week—to say that this service would be ending. As this company said to me: 'Perishables require express delivery from door to door. Our understanding is that, whilst there are other freight companies, there is nobody of the size of Australia Post that can currently offer the express or guaranteed overnight service that perishable goods require.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to quote some other primary producers in Tasmania. Indeed, the first one is from my electorate. People may have heard of Nick Haddow and his world-class Bruny Island Cheese Company. He said, as reported by the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Mercury</span>: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">… the announcement felt like "the trapdoor has fallen out from underneath us".</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The choices of freight provider are very limited in Tasmania so when the largest one pulls out it leaves those customers extremely exposed …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have Anne Bennett from Ashgrove cheese in north-west Tasmania. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… 60 per cent of Ashgrove's online sales comprised of perishable goods, making guaranteed 24 hour delivery "essential".</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what is being said. I have another producer in my electorate who said to me that in the last 12 months he's been sending in excess of 13,500 parcels via this service. His company provides gourmet baskets and it is supporting other small Tasmanian producers right across the island state. This is simply not good enough from the federal government—the Morrison government—and from Australia Post. They need to do much, much more consulting with businesses about how this can be made to work, rather than saying it's all too hard and throwing up their hands. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The primary producers in Tasmania who have been relying on this service, particularly during times of COVID last year, are innovative and they have moved more to online sales. One of the producers was telling me their sales online are up nearly 300 per cent. This is the way that they are innovating to make their businesses survive and to keep jobs in Tasmania, particularly in the regions, where a lot of these small producers are. So I call on the government, the minister responsible for Australia Post and the minister for agriculture to do a lot more and to have a lot more discussions with Australia Post to ensure that this essential service remains.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure that, in regional parts of this country, not just in Tasmania but right around the country, there are a lot of other producers who are relying on this extremely valuable service. Australia Post say, 'We're just going to end it; that's the end of it,' when there is no alternative and there is no other organisation that provides the service that is currently provided by Australia Post. Last time I checked, this business was owned by the Australian taxpayer. It is there to service the people of Australia. I don't know anybody in this country who wouldn't think it reasonable that Australia Post actually deliver these items as it has been doing up until this point. It seems extraordinary that they can just say, 'We're not going to do it anymore; it is all too hard,' when these people and the businesses and, importantly, the jobs in regional areas have been relying on being able to use this essential service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mail, particularly in rural and regional areas, is an essential service. It should be delivered by Australia Post. The government needs to talk to Australia Post and to tell Australia Post that this is not good enough and that it needs to find a way to continue to offer this service right around the country, particularly for those primary producers with perishable goods in my home state of Tasmania and particularly in regional areas that are relying so heavily on these types of services. I say to the government, to the ministers and to Australia Post: get your act together. Fix it. It's not good enough. We won't stand for this ending on 30 June.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:05</span>):  I rise today absolutely thrilled that the $10 million investment that the Morrison government has made in the Olympics bid has pushed South-East Queensland one step further towards hosting the next Olympic Games. The 2032 Olympics is an amazing opportunity for the Gold Coast. Of course we have a rich history on the Gold Coast of producing world-class athletes and Olympians—and swimmers. We have surfing, which is now an Olympic sport, cycling and many other sports across the Gold Coast. Our sons and daughters have won gold, silver and bronze. We've produced world champions on the Gold Coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The lead-up to this event itself is a huge promotional opportunity. It's a showcase for the Gold Coast, for tourism, for events and, of course, for other businesses like small businesses, more so than any other city because we are merely getting the word out on what our city and region offers. We're not starting from scratch. We're building on the legacy of the 2018 Commonwealth Games. We have the facilities and experience in hosting many sports already, including at Metricon Stadium, which is in the seat of Moncrieff, in my seat, where we saw the opening of the 2018 Commonwealth Games. I watched the track and field events at Metricon Stadium. Those facilities are already in place, and we welcome the opportunity for more infrastructure, such as fast rail from Brisbane to the Gold Coast and of course a 10,000-seat stadium, which we desperately need on the Gold Coast. We've got a 3,000 seater and a 30,000 seater, but we don't have a 10,000 seater, and we need that for sports such as women's AFL. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The marathon would be an event that could be hosted on the Gold Coast. The last Gold Coast Marathon went past my house, actually. It was quite a spectacle. We sat at the coffee shop, and we watched marathon runners from all over the world run down the foreshore, and it was absolutely spectacular.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms BELL:</span>
                  </a>  That's right; along the beach. The Gold Coast Marathon has, of course, been a very successful event since 1979, so it is an exciting prospect for us on the Gold Coast to host the Olympic marathon in 2032—absolutely brilliant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was also reported this morning that it could mean up to 100,000 jobs for South-East Queensland. When you consider that Queensland has the worst unemployment rate in the country, this is very, very important for our local economy. The economic benefits from preparations for the Olympics will be of direct benefit to the Gold Coast and will promote the long-term confidence that we need. When the time comes to engage with our international visitors and our overseas markets, this will be something that we can absolutely promote across the globe. It will increase the confidence of those returning international visitors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have existing sporting venues and accommodation at the Gold Coast. We have a head start on the preparations. We have a great climate, which will be enjoyed by all. There are opportunities for, as I said, surfing on the beaches as an Olympic sport. It's a great city. What we have on offer is fantastic. We have a well-connected South-East Queensland and northern New South Wales, which offers tremendous practicality and appeal to the international community. The 2018 Commonwealth Games demonstrated that the Gold Coast can deliver world-class events with professionalism and style. We invite all teams to come to the Gold Coast from all over Australia right now to train for their sport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My final point today, as we celebrate International Women's Day here at Parliament House, is that the 2032 Olympics is the catalyst for the Gold Coast to cement its reputation as the home for women's sports. At the Reimagine Forum that I convened last August, one of the key outcomes that we were looking for in our city was to cement the Gold Coast as the home for women's sports. We already have the Gold Coast Suns AFL women's team in Moncrieff and the Southport Sharks women's team—which ended up first on the ladder in the last season, and I congratulate them for that. Once we get a stadium with 10,000 capacity on the Gold Coast, we will be able showcase AFL women's games a lot better. I would also like to commend the member for Fairfax for the work that he has done in leading a delegation for the federal government to secure the 2032 Olympics, and I look forward to making sure that we deliver that for Queensland.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (11<span class="HPS-Time">:10</span>):  Every Australian needs to have full confidence that the coronavirus vaccine rollout is being done safely. It is really that simple. It is completely unacceptable that less than a week into the vaccine rollout there has been a major error by one of the private providers contracted by the federal government. I was disturbed to hear that, in my home city of Brisbane, in Queensland, two elderly residents of an aged-care facility were given four times the safe dosage of the vaccine. These are extremely vulnerable members of our community and they are trusting the federal government to protect them. Those two people have been taken to hospital and, thankfully, they seem to be doing okay. But the damage is done when it comes to people's confidence in the vaccine rollout.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, the Minister for Health and Aged Care couldn't even provide clarity when we were trying to get to the bottom of how this happened and he had to clarify and correct his mistakes in the parliament. He first said the doctor who made this mistake had completed the required training to do this work. He then had to come back to the House to correct the record. That raises some concerns for me. The first is that the health minister provided incorrect information through the media to the public and then also to the parliament. My second concern, which is more serious, is whether the government is doing its due diligence when it comes to the outsourced providers that are administering these vaccines, because the events of yesterday suggest that the health minister is happy to take the word of contractors without doing his own checks. The government have very publicly created this program for administering vaccines to aged-care facilities. That means the care of this vulnerable group of people is the federal government's responsibility, not the responsibility of the contractors they have outsourced. The buck stops with the federal government when it comes to mistakes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the height of the pandemic, when 685 aged-care residents tragically lost their lives, we were told by the Prime Minister that every aged-care worker had been trained in the use of personal protective equipment. The truth was that only one in five people had been trained. That was a mistake we couldn't afford. In other developed nations, like the UK and Canada, vaccines were going into people's arms less than a week after approval. Meanwhile the Pfizer vaccine was approved in Australia in January and was only rolled out at the start of this week, almost a full month later. That was a mistake we couldn't afford.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard stories just yesterday of aged-care facilities that were told by private contractors that someone would arrive to administer the vaccines and then no-one showed up—another mistake we cannot afford. We are already lagging behind the rest of the world when it comes to vaccinating people. This puts us at risk. We are at risk of public confidence in the vaccine dropping; we're at risk of unnecessary economic setbacks because we can't open up quickly enough; and we are at risk of more Australians getting sick. The government has made too many mistakes that we can't afford. I call on the government today: no more mistakes. The Morrison government has put more focus on the announcement than the delivery—and I have said this before publicly. But right now it is imperative that what was promised is actually delivered. People's lives depend on it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do support the Premier of Queensland, Annastacia Palaszczuk, in calling for the Prime Minister to hold an emergency meeting of the national cabinet. He needs to front up and we need the answers right now. While he's there, I would also ask him to explain to my fellow Queenslanders why the locations were first chosen for the vaccine rollout. I find it curious and a bit concerning that the majority of the 41 Queensland locations located in phase 1(a) of the rollout are in federal LNP held seats. We know that the government has played politics with the pandemic before, when it slapped Liberal Party logos on the Commonwealth vaccine announcements. I hope we are not seeing anything like that again, at a time when the health and the safety of vulnerable communities are more important than anything else. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to applaud the government for ensuring that the first round of vaccine goes to residential aged-care and disability facilities. A quarter of the Oxley electorate, which I proudly represent, is aged over 65. Many of those people live in residential aged care. Aged care is the biggest employer of the people in the Oxley electorate. I know these people and their families are wondering right now why they haven't been included in this initial vaccine rollout. I'll be meeting with aged-care providers in my community in the next few weeks to hear their concerns and bring them directly to the minister and to the Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that the Prime Minister can address these issues and say that, honestly, these decisions were influenced only by the health professionals. We all want that. We all want this vaccine rolled out effectively, safely and as soon as possible. No excuses and no more mistakes—we need to get this right so our lives can return to normal and for the health of all Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:15</span>):  I've spoken before of opportunity arising from adversity. I learned this week from Landcare, NRM Regions Australia, Australian Land Conservation Alliance and Pew Charitable Trusts that more than 100 conservation, land management and farming organisations have come together to support a proposal for thousands of workers to be employed to deliver practical conservation and land management activities across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We as a nation are learning that we need to nurture this land on its terms and not ours to take responsibility for the ravages of the land since the second peoples' arrival. So how can we go about repairing it? One way worth considering is working with a nature employment program, which would build on the long-term efforts of volunteers and charitable organisations in the conservation and land management sector and not reinvent the wheel. It would support people already invested in communities. It would offer opportunities for safe, meaningful and socially beneficial work during the period of economic recovery while leaving enduring benefits for locals, tourism, farm businesses and, of course, the environment. This initiative is part of an enduring commitment to Australia's land, water, wildlife and strong grassroots network. It is a deep commitment to supporting those in need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Federal and state investment in this initiative would result in both immediate and long-term return. According to Ernst &amp; Young's assessment of the program proposal, a $500 million investment would result in 6,690 jobs, a $1.2 billion long-term economic reward and practical local action to protect and restore the natural environment by restoring rivers, wetlands and coastal habitats. Reducing soil erosion, controlling weeds and planting trees are obvious outcomes. Strengthening the social capital of our communities is often more difficult to see but critical in the long-term health of our people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In these uncertain times, we are in need of a social glue that helps stick us together. Such a grassroots approach can do that. It builds a sense of belonging in the community, can lift the spirit and give hope after the battering many regional communities have endured through the ravages of droughts, floods and bushfires. In rebuilding our nation, let us not forget the land on which it stands and be ready to learn old ways which have stood the test of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time to listen with generous hearts, not fearful minds and not selfish egos in a lust for power or wealth. It's time to dig deep and find what we are really made of. Care of each other, our communities and the land on which we live is our priority. Once we get this right, the rest will unfold as it should. We can continue to find opportunity in adversity. It seems to be what we do best in this nation. This is a call to the government to bless the regions.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONROY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:18</span>):  On ABC Radio Newcastle recently Dr Anthea Bill, the lead economist at the Hunter Research Foundation, was asked what the impacts of the government's imminent cuts to JobKeeper and JobSeeker would be. Dr Bill responded, 'Well, that's the key question.' That is indeed the key question that the government has to provide an answer on to the 17,000 of my constituents on JobKeeper and the 8,000 on JobSeeker. A quarter of the adults in my electorate are in receipt of one of these payments. I can give the government some examples of the impacts that the shocking and premature removal of support are already having on my home region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I visited Survivor's R Us—an organisation helping combat domestic violence, which is also a food bank—just before Christmas, and then dropped in the week before last to see how things were going. Unfortunately, things are not going well. Survivor's R Us founder, Ann-Maria Martin, reported to me a 200 per cent increase in demand for food parcels after the government's cuts to JobSeeker and JobKeeper in January. This is on top of the tripling in demand for assistance that they saw in September after the first cuts to JobKeeper and JobSeeker. That's a whopping 600 per cent increase in demand for food assistance and housing assistance in a mere five months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another local food bank, Southlake Marketplace, reached out to me earlier this week with an update on assistance they're providing. On Monday, for example, they provided their free emergency food hampers to a family of eight, a family of six and a family of four. These are people in Australia in 2021 who are struggling, through no fault of their own, to put food on their table. What is the government's response? To make further cuts. I said last year that the government's policy response was premature and that it is not only bad economics but also sick social policy. Every Liberal and National member of this place should be ashamed of supporting an approach that makes it harder for people to get through life. Ann-Maria said, 'I don't think the government realises how tough people are doing it. People are scared. The mums and dads are wondering how they're going to feed their children.' I want to assure Ann-Marie, her wonderful team and all the people who volunteer at the food banks in Shortland that I and my Labor colleagues are very aware of how tough people are doing it and are fighting every day to stop these draconian cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to bring to the attention of the House the one million people who have been excluded from JobKeeper. Like many MPs, I'm regularly contacted by many travel agents, whose industry has been decimated and who are struggling to survive. Before Christmas, I met with Brett Dann, the head of Hunter Travel Group. Brett warned just last week that, unless there is continuing support for the travel industry, specifically through JobKeeper, between 85 and 90 per cent of the travel agent industry will be decimated. This is an industry that employs 50,000 people around the country. This is a clear message from every travel agent I've met: there needs to be an extension of JobKeeper or some targeted support for the tourism industry. The agents always acknowledge and are always grateful for the wage subsidy and tourism support package from the end of last year, but it is not right to cut these workers off when the industry is nowhere close to recovery. I thank the many travel agents who have contacted and lobbied me and assure them that I've heard their message. I just hope the government has as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer recently released statistics that suggest that two-thirds of Hunter workers who were receiving JobKeeper in September are no longer receiving it. While I welcome any new and permanent employment increase, this statistic still highlights the fact that at least a third of those people are still on JobKeeper and are relying on it dramatically. This is not a statistic that can be cast aside lightly. These are thousands of people in the Hunter region and in Shortland in particular who, come 31 March when JobKeeper ends, will be forced to go on JobSeeker at a very reduced rate of only $43.57 a day. These are mostly people who have never been without work and for whom relying on a government benefit is completely foreign, and they will be forced on to one of the lowest income support payments in the OECD.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge the government to remember that there are still over two million Australians who are out of work or are looking for work. I urge them to be cognisant of the fact that there has been a 600 per cent increase in food assistance in electorates like mine. There is a dramatic need to support travel agents. There is a dramatic need to recognise that there are millions of Australians who are still doing it tough, aren't out of the COVID recession, and are struggling to feed their kids, pay their rent or pay their mortgage. They should not be abandoned, yet that is what this government will be doing when it cuts JobKeeper and cuts JobSeeker come the end of March.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:23</span>):  Last night, I watched and heard the testimony of a midwife who was present at a live birth following an abortion. She was asked to actually photograph the child for the hospital records, or the medical clinic's records, and while taking the photograph the child actually started breathing. The child started breathing and continued to live for several hours, and that child died without any medical intervention. This happens in hospitals and abortion clinics across this country on a more regular basis than we would like to think and what the abortionists like to admit, because one of them, in recent times, has said that this is a rare occurrence; it is not a rare occurrence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the Parliamentary Library do a bit of research on this topic, looking into the commonality of abortions where there is a live birth. What they found is that, according to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mother, Baby </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nd Child</span> publication, there were a total of 1,626 late-term abortions in Victoria that resulted in 198 live births between 2012 and 2016. That's over 12 per cent of those late-term abortions that resulted in live births. There does not appear to be any medical intervention as a result of those births.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Queensland, an ABC report stated there were 204 terminations with live birth outcomes between 2005 and 2015. In fact, the Queensland Health clinical guidelines for medical termination of pregnancy actually state that if a live birth occurs:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In WA, as at 19 May 2017, there were 27 cases of abortion that resulted in a live birth that were reported between July 1999 and December 2016. Of these, 21 were at 20 weeks gestation or later. There is no record of medical intervention or resuscitation in these cases.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In South Australia, while abortion has been liberalised very recently, thanks to the work of people like Jodie Pickard and Love Adelaide, and the work of Senator Antic, who's in the chamber here listening to my speech, there have been provisions put into new laws that actually make it a legal obligation that medical care be given to babies born alive during abortions.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't know the full picture. Those stats that I quoted from other states are not the full picture, and there is certainly no data out of Tasmania, the Northern Territory or the ACT. Also, New South Wales does not publish statistics.</span>

                  </a>  That is clear; in this country we are in breach of our international obligations. As a result, I have had the Office of Parliamentary Counsel actually draft for me a bill. It is the Human Rights (Children Born Alive Protection) Bill 2021. This bill seeks to make it mandatory in all states and territories for all corporations that are involved in medical terminations of pregnancies, or abortions, to actually provide medical life-saving treatment when a child is born alive as a result of an abortion. Whatever your view on abortion, there should be no argument against providing a child that is out of the womb, that is at 22 weeks or more and has a chance of living—we know this from babies that are born very, very early—life-saving treatment.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have written to the Prime Minister, the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Attorney-General and the Deputy Prime Minister to ask them to consider making this bill a government bill, or at least allowing it as a private member's bill, to go to a vote on the floor of parliament. This should be the most serious issue before this parliament because it's a life and death issue. Young babies are dying across this country, and it needs to stop!</span>
