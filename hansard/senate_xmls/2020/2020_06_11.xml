                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">09:31</span>):  Fifty years ago today the Senate established a committee system that forever changed the role and work of senators and the Senate and the parliament itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 11 June 1970, after five hours of debate, the Senate adopted two important resolutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One established legislative and general purpose standing committees to inquire into government activity and legislation in seven subject areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other established five estimates committees to examine government spending.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The change in the work of the Senate was immediate and dramatic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senate committees had produced around 120 reports in the 69 years prior to the change and more than 5,500 reports in the 50 years since.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Public hearings in the same period increased from 500 prior to the change to over 7,000 since.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through its committee work the Senate became a force for inquiry and scrutiny in a way that was scarcely imagined in 1970—dare I say even in 1901—and in ways that reinforce the uniqueness of this chamber across the Westminster world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have said previously this chamber is the prime legislative chamber in the nation, with a direct mandate from the people, constitutional authority to press its case and an electoral system that ensures the diverse voices of the nation are heard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But a substantial part of this standing is the direct result of the committee system that has operated over the last five decades and that brings these institutional features to life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to inform the Senate that later in the year the 50th anniversary will be marked with the launch of new website resources to visualise the work of the more than 250 Senate committees established since 1901. These will explore the history and achievements of committees and chart thousands of committee hearings in hundreds of locations around Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The launch will provide all of us with an opportunity to reflect upon and celebrate the work of the Senate's committee system, and I look forward to providing further detail about that event in coming months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I cannot mention this anniversary without acknowledging the work of the staff of the Senate, particularly those from various functions who have supported the work of Senate committees over the decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work we do as senators is built upon these foundations and the support we have received from the thousands of staff who have worked here over the last 50 years. So, on behalf of all senators, to all the staff over the years, led by all the clerks: thank you.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The system of standing and estimates committees that was established on this day in 1970 has helped establish the Senate as a significant place for scrutiny and review. It's a signal achievement in the history of our chamber and of parliamentary democracy in this country. The arrangements that have evolved over the last 50 years have changed, but, fundamentally, the Senate's ability to hold governments to account would not be possible without this system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is hard to believe, but prior to 1970 only three bills had ever been referred to committees. I was reading through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> to look at how this debate commenced, and there were, of course, two motions that were adopted: a government motion moved by Senator Anderson and a Labor motion moved by Senator Murphy. Murphy noted at the time that there was no copyright on the proposals to set up standing committees in a legislature, acknowledging the role of all contributors at that time. But, as a Labor senator from New South Wales and a Labor senator from the progressive tradition that Murphy hailed from, I am, of course, particularly interested in his contribution, and he applied his customary energy and intellect to the task of reforming the Senate. In introducing the motion that established the standing committees, he said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… demand for improved performance all over the world. It may be manifested in some places in riots, in demonstrations and in other ways in a less violent manner, but a demand for institutions such as ours to carry out their work efficiently is becoming apparent. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is something about that contribution that speaks to our time also: a recognition that parliamentary chambers must hold ourselves to the highest standards, must give voice to the highest aspirations of all of our people and must always conduct ourselves with energy, dignity and a clear sense of democratic purpose. Mr President, I thank you for drawing this occasion to the Senate's attention and I look forward to the celebrations that you have foreshadowed.</span>

People in this place will know that I have been heavily involved with the committee system and that I have chaired some of those committees. I would also particularly like to give a call out to the secretariat staff of all the committees. They just work and work and work. They never say no; maybe sometimes they should learn to say no.

Not only do they expose things sometimes; they also enable the community to become part of this place, and that's why I think they're so important. They allow the community to comment on legislation. The committees look at legislation, drill down into legislation and enable community and broader Australia to see how this place operates and to comment on what we do. The reference committees in particular are where the community really gets to participate. They actually get to suggest things to us: 'Why don't you inquire into this?' That is such an important role of committees. </span>

They are just two things that immediately spring to mind, but there have been many, many more. It is a vital part of what we do in this place. So thank you, Mr President, for reminding us of this anniversary. It's a vital and continuing part of the work of this place.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="283596" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RENNICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:39</span>):  The importance of making leave available for parents for the arrival of a child is well known, contributing to the health and wellbeing of mothers, babies and the stability of families. A 2016 Ernst &amp; Young study of more than 1,500 employers showed that over 80 per cent of companies that offered paid parental leave reported a positive effect in employee morale, and over 70 per cent reported a boost in productivity. If employees are happy with their work and home balance then they are more likely to be satisfied at work, positively affecting their productivity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the current PPL system, the primary caregiver is given 18 weeks of parental leave pay in a continuous block within 12 months of the birth or adoption of a child. The Paid Parental Leave Amendment (Flexibility Measures) Bill 2020 seeks to amend existing legislation by allowing mothers or primary caregivers to split the 18-week leave block to better suit their situation. This reform will mean that the first 12 weeks of the PPL will remain as a continuous block within the first year, while the remaining six weeks can then be used at any time up until the child turns two.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the bill is to provide wider and more convenient options for families so that the PPL scheme can best meet their needs. This amendment will help women who are self-employed or small business owners who cannot afford to be off work for such an extended period—18 consecutive weeks. With the legislation as it now stands, women and primary carers who must return to work effectively lose the balance of their entitlement. With the support of the Senate and the passage of this bill, parents and, more particularly, women will retain their full PPL entitlement and finally be able to tailor their leave to fit their personal circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Primary carers have a balance of up to six weeks, which, based on a five-day working week, equates to 30 work days to use as they wish after the initial 12-week block. For example, if a woman works from home running her own business and has a baby, under the current legislation she is entitled to Paid Parental Leave which she must take in a continuous 18-week block. During this time, the woman cannot return to work and run her business or she will forfeit her remaining PPL. However, for women in this situation, being away from their business for such a long time has the potential to cause serious financial damage. Incoming clients, as well as valuable momentum, can be lost, especially if the business is in its infancy and has not yet started turning a profit. If the woman wanted to do any work to keep the business going, she wouldn't be able to do so without losing the remainder of her PPL.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new bill does away with some of this rigidity and will allow mothers to go back to work after 12 weeks, while they retain the option of claiming a further six weeks later. They therefore have the flexibility of using the remaining six weeks as best suits them in their situation. Some may choose to take their leave over the Christmas and new year period, when many businesses slow down, while others may prefer to spread out their leave, taking regular breaks while they continue to manage their work commitments. As for employed women, the flexible leave can help support a more gradual return to work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since paid parental leave is dispensed by the employer, employees can negotiate with their employer to work part-time. This could operate as an effective, three-day working week by receiving PPL for the remaining two days. Alternatively, some women may also choose to use the six weeks immediately after the initial 12, making it 18 consecutive weeks of PPL, as before. However the leave is used, the point is that there is now flexibility of choice for women to make a personal decision about what is best for them and their family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is anticipated that this reform will help ensure greater economic independence and improved career development, key aims of the Women's Economic Security Statement. The bill will also make it easier for mothers to transfer their leave to eligible partners who become primary carers, thereby encouraging the sharing of parental duties with fathers and secondary carers. This could lend itself to a shift in social norms, whereby fathers take on a more active role in child rearing and giving both parents more opportunity to balance their work and home lives to better suit their situation. As a stay-at-home father, I can thoroughly recommend to take that option up to all fathers who are thinking about staying home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill makes a very worthwhile amendment to an important piece of legislation to support self-starting women to have the same advantages as those conventionally employed. It allows the government to help support women so that they don't have to miss out on either a family or a career. Approximately 4,000 parents are anticipated to use the new flexible leave provisions, where currently around 2,300 mothers fail to use their full PPL entitlement before returning to work. In most cases that's simply because they can't afford it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will ensure that women's employment, businesses and careers will be more secure and productive, leading to better outcomes for them, their families and, in turn, the nation. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:45</span>):  I'm grateful to have the opportunity to speak on the Paid Parental Leave Amendment (Flexibility Measures) Bill 2020 and the subject of paid parental leave. It's an area that Australia could and should be doing a lot better in, particularly when we're compared with similar OECD countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, up until the introduction of the Paid Parental Leave scheme by the Gillard Labor government in 2011, Australia was one of only two OECD countries that did not have a paid parental leave scheme, the other country being the United States. And, while the scheme isn't perfect, 150,000 parents a year do benefit from it. Nearly half of all new mothers benefit from the scheme, and this has allowed improvements when it comes to enabling women to continue to participate in the workforce; enhancing the health of birth mothers and children; and also, critically, in promoting equality between women and men. However, it's important to note that we do still have further to go on all of these.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The flexibility measures that we're talking about today will, hopefully, go some way to improve these indicators even further. The flexibility measures in this bill will change the paid parental leave rules by splitting the 18 weeks of publicly paid parental leave into a 12-week paid parental leave period and a six-week flexible paid parental leave period. The 12-week period will still have to be taken as a continuous block, but will now be accessible by the primary carer at any time during the first 12 months. Right now, it has to be taken immediately after the birth or adoption of a child. The six-week flexible paid parental leave period will be able to be taken at any time during the first two years, and doesn't need to be taken as a continuous block. That's going to allow families to split their entitlements over a two-year period, with periods of work in between. The changes are modest but they will, hopefully, allow parents more flexibility when it comes to sharing parenting responsibilities in a way that works for them. Parents will now be able to use the leave when it suits them most, rather than it being entirely prescribed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In practice, the most likely use of this new flexibility will be parents spreading the new flexible paid parental leave period over a number of months to allow them to return to work part-time. And while these changes are really positive, they are modest. They don't increase paid parental leave entitlements for families. We do need to look at both the quantity and the quality of support that we're providing to new parents in this country, because when compared with other OECD countries we're starting to fall behind. Unfortunately, the bill doesn't do anything to address that or to change that. For example: other countries are quickly increasing the support that they provide to fathers and to partners, both to encourage them to spend more time at home during a child's early years and to increase the flexibility for families as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, this bill does provide more flexibility, but it's a small step and there are plenty of issues that it doesn't solve which we, as a parliament, need to think about in the context of paid parental leave. One of those critical issues is the persistent gender pay gap in this country. Female workers in Australia earn on average 14 per cent less than their male colleagues, which is an extraordinary figure to be citing in 2020. This has been persistent over the last two decades, and the changes—the narrowing of that gender pay gap—have been really minor. Paid parental leave and providing families with flexibility are major factors in addressing the gender pay gap, but not enough on their own.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the current COVID-19 crisis ongoing, we're currently relying on so many female dominated industries to keep us safe and healthy: our medical, hospital and allied health workers, our social carers, aged carers and disability carers and, of course, our early childhood educators, who've done such a heroic job over the past few months by continuing to go to work every day to care for and educate future generations and keep Australians at work. On average, all of these groups of workers are paid significantly less than their male colleagues in other sectors and, indeed, within the same sectors. In healthcare services, the gender pay gap is a whopping 32 per cent. So these essential workers need a lot more than just our thanks at this time. What they really need is recognition in their pay packets and the ability to progress their careers with the respect and the recognition that they deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Paid parental leave is an important part of this. It's also an important part of the discussion around workforce participation, and ensuring that women stay in the workforce and in these critical industries. In relation to paid parental leave, a pressing issue raised by my friend and colleague, the federal member for Bendigo, that needs to be addressed is those parents who could miss out due to the COVID-19 crisis, because to be eligible for paid parental leave you must have worked an average of one day a week for 10 of the last 13 months. Right now, across the country, there are thousands and thousands of workers—and we know lots of them are women—who have been stood down from their jobs or have had their industry shut down. If they're stood down for too long, there's a chance that they'll miss out on paid parental leave. If that family loses both paid parental leave and dad and partner pay, they could be in really significant trouble. The government's suggestion that affected families should apply for other forms of income support, such as JobKeeper, is just not the right solution at this time. The last thing that any new parent wants is to have to worry about how much money they have in their bank account. So I'd like to take the opportunity to urge the government to address that issue as fast as possible so that new parents don't miss out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this bill that we're talking about today, is a step in the right direction. It's small, it's modest, but it's definitely heading in the right direction, and it's going to benefit families by providing more flexible access to the Paid Parental Leave Scheme. By splitting up the 18 weeks of paid parental leave into a 12-week period and a six-week flexible paid parental leave period, families will be able to use their entitlements in a way that is more tailored to them and that suits them. So I hope the parliament continues to engage in a discussion about how to address some of the issues that I've spoken about today and that others have spoken about, including the persistent gender pay gap, recognising our essential female workers and improving the workplace participation of women into the future.</span>

                    <a href="281558" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ASKEW</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:53</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Paid Parental Leave Amendment (Flexibility Measures) Bill 2020. As chair of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, I'm pleased to make a contribution to this discussion on paid parental leave. This bill expands on the safety net already in place for working families with the Paid Parental Leave Scheme, but it makes it more flexible and therefore better. It means families are able to enjoy that special time in the first months of a child's life without having money worries. This is time our new parents deserve to enjoy with their newest family member.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It may be hard to believe, but it's 32 years since I first took what was then known as maternity leave. In fact, 32 years ago today, I was at home looking after my first child, my son, who at that time would have been about six weeks old. Those first few months with your child, adapting to a new daily structure, bonding with them, loving and caring for them and also experiencing the weight of responsibility of another human being to look after are all very special, precious moments. I acknowledge that, when I had my family, I was fortunate to work in a bank that was ahead of its time and offered staff paid maternity leave combined with the opportunity to take additional unpaid leave for up to 12 months. I also had flexibility and was able to take leave, but I returned to work on a part-time basis after about the 10-month period. Then I gave birth to my daughter, only 16 months after my son was born. But, once again, I was able to take that maternity leave and enjoy the precious time at home with both my children. Many others in the community at that time were not as fortunate. They had to use up their leave entitlements, take unpaid leave and, in many cases, simply resign when they decided they wanted to have a family. And, even if you were in the banking industry, if you were a man wanting to take paternity leave, you were offered just two weeks off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How things have changed, and definitely for the better. On 6 February 2020 the House of Representatives introduced the Paid Parental Leave Amendment (Flexibility Measures) Bill 2020 to parliament. It was referred to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee on the same day, and the committee tabled its report on 19 March, recommending that the bill be passed. The bill was introduced to the Senate on 25 February. In its report the committee noted the clear and widespread support for the measures proposed in the bill, submitters to the inquiry emphasising the positive impact the bill will have on a range of options available to working parents accessing paid parental leave and the flow-on consequences of this for women's workforce participation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Paid Parental Leave Amendment (Flexibility Measures) Bill builds on amendments to the Paid Parental Leave Act 2010 made by the Paid Parental Leave Amendment (Work Test) Act 2019. It also introduces additional key aspects of the Women's Economic Security Package which were previously announced in 2018-19 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The Women's Economic Security Package measures have three key areas of focus: improving women's workforce participation, economic independence and earning potential. The focus of the Paid Parental Leave Amendment (Flexibility Measures) Bill is to increase women's workforce participation and provide more options to families accessing parental leave pay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show there were more than 315,000 registered births in Australia in 2018. The median age for mothers is 31.4 years and it is 33.5 years for fathers. Considering the ABS also found that the proportion of families with children younger than five where both parents work full time rose to 21 per cent in the past decade, we can see that working families are becoming increasingly more common.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Paid Parental Leave scheme provides eligible working parents with 18 weeks of payment at a rate based on the national minimum wage, which is currently $740.60 per week. This equates to a total of $13,330.80 over 18 weeks. This bill is all about increasing flexibility for new parents, which will help those working families bond in the early weeks. We need to be able to balance the health and wellbeing needs of new parents and babies with meaningful workforce participation. Changes to the Paid Parental Leave scheme aim to give mothers and primary caregivers the flexibility to split their maximum parental leave pay entitlement of 18 weeks over a two-year period after an initial 12-week block is taken in the first year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Women's Economic Security Statement was announced in November 2018 by the then Minister for Women, the Hon. Kelly O'Dwyer, $119 million in funding was committed to improving workforce participation, economic independence and earning potential. Changes to the Paid Parental Leave scheme were included in that announcement. Schedule 1 of this bill seeks to make amendments to the Paid Parental Leave scheme so families can access their parental leave pay in a way that suits them. As it stands now, parental leave pay can only be taken as a continuous 18-week block within the first 12 month following a child's birth or adoption. However, the families of children born or adopted once the bill comes into effect will be able to split their parental leave pay into blocks of leave taken over a two-year period. This flexible plan allows for periods of work in between leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes proposed in this bill mean parents can use an initial 12-week block of their entitlement anytime within the first 12 months following the birth or adoption of their child before returning to work. This all-important time gives parents time to recuperate immediately following birth or adoption and supports health benefits for the child. It also allows time to settle into a routine and bond as a family in those first months. This initial time frame is called the paid parental leave period and the rules relating to this block are the same as those for the current 18-week period. Parents will be able to take their remaining entitlement of up to six weeks anytime before the child turns two years old, and can return to work anytime during this period. These periods combined still total 18 weeks, which is the same time currently allowed, but they allow for greater flexibility. This second type of leave is called flexible paid parental leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we anticipate many families will claim their 30 flexible paid parental leave days straight after their 12-week period ends, we know others might want to use their flexible leave to support a gradual return to work. For example, a new mother might want to return to work at reduced hours after her initial 12-week paid parental leave has been used. The mother could return to work part time at three days a week and apply for the remaining two days to be paid as flexible paid parental leave for 15 weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Families will be able to use their paid parental leave flexibly to support whichever approach works best for them. Of course, increased flexibility for claimants means it could work differently for employers, but the scheme will not create an additional or unnecessary regulatory burden for employers. The Paid Parental Leave scheme is fully funded by the Australian government, not by employers. This is consistent with the current scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Eligibility criteria for paid parental leave and accessing flexible leave are generally the same—that is, the person must be on leave or not working, be the primary carer of the child, meet residency requirements and not be in a newly arrived resident's waiting period. However, unlike during the initial paid parental leave period, parents and others will not lose eligibility to claim parental leave pay during the flexible leave period if they don't meet the eligibility criteria on days when they're not claiming payment—that is, days when they return to work or if they stop being the primary carer for a day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This scheme will start operating from 1 July 2020 and will be applicable to children born or adopted on or after that date. Children born or adopted before this date will be assessed under the current Paid Parental Leave scheme and receive their entitlements in a continuous 18-week block. Parents are only eligible to claim parental leave pay on days they are on leave or not at work. In many instances employees take a period of unpaid parental leave under the Fair Work Act 2009 during the period they are claiming parental leave pay. Eligible employees are entitled to take up to 12 months of unpaid parental leave associated with the birth or adoption of a child, but generally this leave is taken in a single continuous period and starts no later than the birth or adoption of the child. Under the existing framework, once an employee returns to work they usually forfeit any remaining untaken unpaid parental leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes will help thousands of new parents, many of whom are now returning to work before they have used all of their parental leave pay. Each year approximately 2,300 people access only a portion of their parental leave pay before returning to work. While this means they are losing valuable time with their child at a formative time, it also makes them ineligible to receive further parental leave pay for that child. Primary carers can return to work earlier after the child's birth or adoption without compromising their overall entitlement to parental leave pay under this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We anticipate these changes will particularly support self-employed women and small business owners who cannot afford to leave their businesses for 18 consecutive weeks. For example, they can take their 12-week block of leave and then choose to take the remaining six weeks of entitlement at a time that suits their personal and business needs, such as at a quiet time for their business, like over the Christmas and new year period or during an off-peak season for specific industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This change reflects the range of working demands and personal preferences that women may have in relation to their return to work after giving birth or a primary carer may have caring for a child. The increased flexibility will also make it easier for mothers who are eligible for parental leave pay to transfer their entitlement to eligible partners who take on the role of primary carer where it suits the family's circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed changes to parental leave pay will give parents more choice, allowing them to tailor their payments to meet their family's needs and situation. In addition, increasing the flexibility of parental leave pay could lead to a greater uptake of leave by secondary carers. This contributes to changing Australia's social norms around sharing care of children and encouraging men to take parental leave. It is anticipated that around 4,000 parents will choose to take their parental leave pay flexibly each year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Liberal member for Mackellar, Jason Falinski, told the House of Representatives in February this year: </span>

I want to recount a story from my time with my own family over the weekend. Happily, I was able to see my mother on my birthday, which is not a common experience. I also got to spend the weekend with my own children, and one of my daughters spoke to me about a conversation she overheard with a young mum who was very judgemental about women who were returning to work after six months of paid leave. I really hope we are able to leave those judgements and attitudes behind. I believe raising a family is the greatest work of my life and the greatest joy of my life. But 28 years ago, when I went back to work six months after the birth of my first child, it was a choice that involved much negative judgement from many people. I'm pleased to say that we still have a great mother-daughter bond—and in our family there are pretty good father-daughter bonds as well.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is important in the context of that changing discussion over the decades about what it is to be a great family and to be a great parent, whether you're a mum or a dad or part of the extended family—or indeed part of the community that raises great children, for your own personal satisfaction as a human being and ultimately for the benefit of the society and the community in which we live. That is why the flexibility measures in this bill are actually a really important part of it. The bill will indeed introduce far greater flexibility for parents looking to take time off to care for their newborn or newly adopted child and will allow the role of the primary carer to change as well as allowing them to access six weeks of leave to be taken at any time in the first two years of a child's life. The estimations are that this should help about 4,000 parents per annum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The specifics of the bill change the paid parental leave rules in three critical ways. Firstly, they split the 18-week period of paid leave into a 12-week paid parental leave period and a six-week flexible paid parental leave period. The 12-week paid parental leave period entitlement will be available only as a continuous block but will also be accessible by the primary carer at any time during the first 12 months—not only immediately after the birth or adoption of a child. The complexity of people's lives and the variety of ways in which families manage—families in business, families in uncertain employment, families in between houses, families managing sickness across their family and all of those complex lived realities—requires a system that meets the messiness of life, and this is an important change that will help. The six-week flexible paid parental leave period will be available at any time during the first two years and does not need to be taken as a block. I can just imagine, if I were to roll back 28 years and have that sense of time available to help me manage my return to work and looking after our daughter and sharing that responsibility with my husband more flexibly, that we would have had an even better time being parents than we already did.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill attempts to make Australia's paid parental leave scheme—which is among the least generous in the OECD—somewhat more equitable. In 2010 Labor introduced Australia's first paid parental leave scheme. Until that point we were one of only two countries in the OECD, the other being the United States, that didn't have one. It's important to remember that—an important achievement by a Labor government, led by Julia Gillard, to make sure that we ended up with some access to paid parental leave. Under the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments that scheme was not removed, but it did stagnate. Apart from Mr Abbott's wildly extravagant thought bubble that he carried for five years and then dropped, there has been no real sign of change under this government which is now in its third term. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia today still has one of the lowest rates of investment in parental leave, and that stands at just one-third of the OECD average investment in parental leave. Sadly, despite the improvements that this bill will bring into play, the OECD rankings show that we are still one of the lowest with regarding the length of parental leave with 18 weeks being our maximum as opposed to the average of 55 in other jurisdictions. In that, our system provides a flat rate instead of a wage subsidy like most developed nations. Given the significant changes that Australians have undergone in recent times in the context of COVID-19, the understanding of a wage subsidy no doubt will be something that people understand in a very different way now than they did before the calendar turned into 2020. Hopefully, this government might see further reform in this area as part of their agenda. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian workers on average receive less than half the average wage as a result of our scheme. Experts have described it as a welfare subsidy for new parents, rather than as an economic compensation for foregone income. A paid parental leave scheme is meant to be fit for purpose as it's a complex and incredibly important reform for the first iteration to have not received a significant update for 10 years. So between 2010 and 2020, 10 years of no reform in this space is really a blight on our nation's advancement with regard to how we support parents and families. Nearly half of all new mothers benefit from the Paid Parental Leave scheme—almost 150,000 new parents in total. We are clearly slipping behind comparable nations, and it's the working families of Australia that are suffering. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the scheme remains, to a degree, inflexible and out of step with modern work and home practices. The bill, as it's drafted, will allow some tangible flexibility for those families in terms of when and who takes that leave, but it still leaves the rate of pay unchanged. Once again I remind people listening to this debate that the pandemic has shown us that work can indeed be more flexible and that it can be highly productive to work remotely, and this bill is actually a timely connector with that growing reality. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill doesn't do anything to change another critical element of Australian life that needs review, and that is the ongoing wound, the festering sore, of the gender pay gap in Australia. Nor does it do anything to address the way in which women's work is remunerated in Australia. The best thing this government could do to address this would be to reverse the penalty cuts that it waved through. These cuts disproportionately affected heavily female workforces and indeed they have exacerbated the pay gap. It's appalling in this day and age that women in Australia still earn only 86 per cent of the same pay as men, and reforms of the Paid Parental Leave scheme should take this glaring problem into account. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are not normal times. There has never been a more crucial time for this government to focus on the economic and practical needs of women. Last month's ABS jobs data highlighted the detrimental affect the COVID-19 crisis has had on women with regard to the scale of job loss. On top of that, women are overrepresented in jobs affected by the ongoing need for social distancing, such as in the retail and hospitality trades and the high rate of casual employment that is a phenomenon in those sectors. Now the federal government is proposing to end its fee-free childcare relief package on 12 July, and childcare centres will lose access to the JobKeeper wage subsidies. This decision by the government absolutely impacts families with new babies that this legislation is seeking to support. This is the anomaly that is this government: taking with one hand and trying to give with the other. It's hard for people to keep up with which government is in place today: one that's looking to help them or one that's going out to hurt them with things like robodebt and the removal of subsidies that they promised would be with us until September. We know that the government's changing policies have a huge impact on families, with many still struggling financially, and childcare fees that are out of their reach are very much a part of the outlook for many families as they look to their personal financial horizon this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also incredibly concerning that the government has chosen the female dominated childcare sector as the first sector from which remove to the JobKeeper subsidy. Women—indeed, families, but particularly women—rely on child care to be able to work, and women make up 97 per cent of the employees in the childcare sector. You couldn't have more closely targeted a weapon at women than the government has with regard to the childcare sector and the reversal of their promises to support wages and offer wage subsidies. Child care was already unaffordable before COVID-19, and we've only just started to come out of the crisis. The federal Liberal-National parties are already winding back vital support, which will disproportionately impact the same women that the government will crow about supporting with this particular piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we make child care unaffordable for women and if we make it unaffordable generally for women to go back to work, their ability to participate in the workforce will be curtailed, impacted in ways that have flow-on effects, particularly in regional areas of Australia, like the Central Coast and all of the regions of New South Wales that I support as a duty senator such as the seat of Parkes, the Riverina, Farrer, Hume and, dare I say, Eden-Monaro, where a battle is underway for a decent representative—in the shape of Kristy McBain, a woman who cares about that community—to come to Canberra and stand up for a community that was ignored during the bushfire crisis and is still suffering from the failure to make policies that put people at the centre that is the hallmark of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Paid parental leave acknowledges that having children and starting a family is indeed a very critical part of the normal cycle of life. Undertaking the great challenge and opportunity of becoming a parent shouldn't leave you economically disadvantaged. It shouldn't leave you locked out of the workforce and it shouldn't mean you have to choose between caring for very young children or having a roof over your head. Yesterday, we had dnata workers outside this building, with many women raising their very real concerns about how difficult a time this is for them because of the government's hard-heartedness. If the government can acknowledge that flexibility is needed in this bill—indeed, if they can headline it 'the Paid Parental Leave Amendment (Flexibility Measures) Bill'—surely the government can find sufficient flexibility with a signature at the end of the pen of Mr Frydenberg to do the same for the dnata workers to ensure they can receive JobKeeper. That impacts families as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, with these sensible reforms, 10 years after the initial delivery of paid parental leave under a Labor government, this government has finally come to the point of updating the current act by introducing a degree of flexibility to provisions that are more in keeping with contemporary Australia. However, I hope in my contribution I have made it clear that far more reforms are needed in this sphere to provide more support for working families and that Australians should not congratulate themselves in isolation but should look to our comparator countries in the OECD and acknowledge that we are far from the mark in terms of proper financial and practical support for people who need the support of this nation to do the best they can in raising their families. We must end the gender pay gap. We must ensure that Australia's scheme is first, not last, in the OECD.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:19</span>):  I really have missed this place. I've missed the chutzpah that comes from this chamber. I've missed in the last three months the hypocrisy that is given with a straight face so often in this chamber. It's something I haven't had to experience too much in the last few months back home in north Queensland, where you don't really get away with that kind of stuff. You don't really get away with two-faced statements like we just heard from Senator O'Neill. She made some useful contributions, but they were undermined by the fact that she's trying to criticise this Liberal-National government for not doing things that the Labor government that she was a member of didn't do when they were in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They introduced the Paid Parental Leave scheme we have. I recognise that, and it was an important reform that we have maintained, but Senator O'Neill just then said: 'Because you haven't changed it from what we did when we were in government, you're culpable. You're worthy of criticism because you haven't done what I'd like to do.' As I said, Senator O'Neill made some useful contributions, but her arguments would be much more forceful if she applied the same test to the government that she was a member of not that long ago—six or seven years ago. So it's a bit late now to start criticising just one side about those things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fortunately, from what I heard there, Senator O'Neill and the Labor Party will support these sensible changes. This is a commonsense bill really; you could sum it up in those words. They're commonsense changes to a system that is a good one; it's good that we offer and provide paid parental leave. I recognise we can't provide it as far and as expensively as Senator O'Neill would like. These things are always a balance—a balance that the Gillard government had to weigh up and that all governments have to weigh up in terms of government spending and the welfare we can provide to Australians. But these changes are very sensible, because they will ensure that mothers and fathers who are seeking to take paid parental leave can do so in a flexible way over the first 18 months of their child's life. My understanding is that currently the paid parental leave has to be taken in a block, so to speak, of 18 consecutive weeks. These changes will allow mothers—primarily mothers, I presume, are taking the paid parental leave—to do so in a block of 12 weeks within 12 months of the birth of the child. The remaining six weeks can then be used within two years of the birth or adoption, in blocks as small as a day at a time to allow flexible working arrangements. That's all a commonsense change. It's the kind of change about which we say: 'Why didn't we think of that earlier? Why didn't we think of that when it came in?' Some of these things can be missed, but it seems to be well supported across this chamber, which is very good.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is very important that we do support family formation in this country, that we do support people having children in Australia. We are fortunate not to have the seriously low fertility rates of European countries, but our fertility rate is below replacement level, and keep in mind that over the next few years our migration program will be very much curtailed. It's important that Australians continue to have children and we continue to grow and develop our country and our nation. We should support families to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should also support those families that are in the workforce and have to juggle that. This scheme helps do that. But I do want to stress that I think the most important reason to provide paid parental leave, to provide this assistance, is the child, not the parents, not the mother or the father. The reason I strongly support schemes like this is that it's incredibly important for the children's welfare to spend time with their mother or father—particularly their mother, obviously, for reasons of breastfeeding et cetera—in those early years of life. I am fortunate to have had five children. It never gets tired and it's always a journey. It's been a more interesting journey in the last few months, spending more time with them, but we were very fortunate for my wife to be able to take time off work for her first two children, and then after that, she was staying at home anyway. I shouldn't say that, because I will get in trouble; she was working at home, not staying at home—very much hardworking at home, looking after our children. It was very important I think to spend that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just from personal experience; this is laid out in evidence. There was an OECD report. It's a little dated now, but I don't think children have changed much since 2007. The OECD said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Taking stock of the evidence, it seems that child development is negatively affected when an infant does not receive full-time personal care … for at least the first 6 to 12 months of his/her life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A study by the Productivity Commission in 2009 into child care and paid parental leave issues—actually I think it was the study that helped lead to this scheme—said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Most of the more recent evidence tends to support the view that the use of nonparental care/child care (usually necessitated by maternal employment) when initiated within the first year of a child's life can contribute to behavioural problems and, in some contexts, delayed cognitive development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission quoted a range of different scientific studies there to back that evidence up. It is important that we try to support parents to be able to look after their children. I think that's the primary purpose of getting behind these schemes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find sometimes the debate seems to be more about encouraging more female participation in the workforce. I think that that is important, but sometimes the claims for the need for that are overblown in the Australian context. We have average female labour force participation rates across developed countries in the OECD. Countries that have higher females labour force participation rates almost solely are countries with much lower fertility rates than us. Of course countries that have higher fertility rates are going to have lower female workforce participation because parents are going to choose, because of the evidence I just read out, to spend time with their children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a couple of exceptions. Canada and New Zealand have higher female workforce participation rates, although Canada has a lower fertility rate—not as low as some of the European countries but lower than us. The one thing that is never actually mentioned that I think is really important is that the way we count female workforce participation is very different to almost every other country in the world, including Canada and New Zealand, who are often held up as comparators to our workforce participation rates. When a mother is on paid or non-paid parental leave in Australia they are not counted as being in our workforce. In Canada and New Zealand, as is the case in most other countries in the world, if a mother is on paid or non-paid parental leave they are counted as being in the workforce. That gap, difference and statistical quirk accounts for apparently, according to a different Productivity Commission study, about a two to three percentage point difference. About half of the gap between Australia and Canada and New Zealand is accounted for in that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you drill down further and look at female workforce participation rates in child-rearing age groups—from memory, usually from about 18 to 45—it is about the same between Australia and New Zealand. We depart when it's above 45. No-one can really explain that. But, possibly, if we increased paid parental leave schemes, that gap would close because we've already got the same gap for the years mothers have children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think Senator O'Neill made some useful contributions, albeit partisanly applied. It would be good to support families to take more time off to look after children, particularly at very young ages—particularly below the age of one, as was stated in those studies I mentioned. The question here though is: who should fund that? Who can we call on to pay for that benefit? Yes, there is a role for government, as we're doing through these schemes, but I also think it would be better if we could help support families themselves to help fund those choices in life, because they're in the best place to make these choices. All families are different. Some families have great grandparent support and don't necessarily need to take time off work. Others have other support mechanisms. Others don't. All families are different. It would be a good thing if we could provide more choice and flexibility at the family level. Unfortunately, in our country with the way our tax system works we don't provide particularly easy choices for families that would like to take more time off to look after a child. Our tax system is based on the individuals, not families, who put in a tax return individually and are taxed individually. About half of other OECD countries actually have a family based taxation system. They have certain arrangements that allow for the spreading of income between parents or between partners to allow for the fact that, really, most families do their budgets and spend their money on a collective basis. A lot of our welfare schemes are based on that. The family income is the test for the HomeBuilder scheme that's coming in. Family income is the test for family tax benefit, at least for family tax benefit A, but for the tax system it's on an individual basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An OECD study from 2012 showed that Australian single-income families pay more tax and have a greater gap between the tax that they pay and that a double-income family pays, which is the fifth highest gap in the OECD. Only four other countries have a higher gap between the effects of our tax system on single-income and double-income families than in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just updated some calculations. I did quite a lot of work on this in the past, and I just had a look. I got out the ATO tax calculator before and had a look at what the current situation is. For a single-income family, if you're a family with a couple of kids and only one of the parents is working—let's say they earn $100,000 just for round numbers—according to the ATO that family would be liable for $24,497 of tax in a year. Their take-home pay would be about 75 grand. For a family with a couple of kids and both parents working—let's just say they earn $50,000 each—which is $100,000 in total, which is the same family income as the other family, they would individually pay $7,797 worth of tax. In total as a family that's $15,594 for a take-home pay of about $85,000. That's an $8,900 difference between those two families. They're on the same family incomes. They're on 100 grand a year, which is not much more than the average full-time wage currently, so it's about that for an average family in this country and it's a $9,000 difference in tax. That's a lot of money and it doesn't particularly support families making choices to look after their own children and potentially have just one breadwinner, at least for a period of time while they have young children in the household. If they make that choice, if they decide, 'Yes, one of us should stay home and look after the child,' they are at a $9,000 disadvantage a year. When you've got a young child and you've got the costs of having a new family, that is a big, big hit. That is a massive hit, and it's going to influence and change decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I support Senator O'Neill's sentiment that we should help support more families in these times of their lives, I think it would be better if we tried to move to a family paid parental leave scheme rather than a government paid parental leave scheme, because that would help support a family choice and that would help support potentially better outcomes for children's development, based on the best interest of that family and the choices of those mothers and fathers, not the government and not some bureaucrats. It would give families the flexibility to make those decisions. We could and should have a better tax system based on family needs, not just on individual needs.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  I rise to support the Paid Parental Leave Amendment (Flexibility Measures) Bill 2020. This bill seeks to further support Australian working mothers and families by providing for more flexible access to paid parental leave arrangements. This bill will allow the mother of a newborn or adopted child to elect to initially use 12 weeks of their 18-week paid parental leave entitlement prior to using the remaining six weeks at any time over the preceding two years. In contrast to the current scheme, this amendment to the provision of paid parental leave entitlements ensures that those mothers who wish to re-enter the workforce before the expiration of their 18 weeks can do so whilst also retaining access to the remaining period of their entitlements. Once passed by the parliament, this bill will give parents of children born on or after 1 July 2020 access to these new flexible arrangements. These changes add to the amendments already made by the coalition government to the Paid Parental Leave Act late last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, this bill will also allow mothers who choose to return to work the flexibility to transfer their remaining entitlement for paid parental leave to their partner who takes on the role of the primary caregiver or alternatively to use their remaining paid parental leave entitlements to support their return to part-time work by, for example, returning three days per week and receiving paid parental leave for the other days of the week when they would not be working.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new provisions outlined in this bill are focused on outcomes from the Women's Economic Security Package released in 2018, specifically to increase female participation in the workforce. Presently, almost half of all new mothers are accessing paid parental leave in our nation every year. That's 179,000 mothers, and it is expected that approximately 4,000 of these will now access this new flexible option. This is critically important, because we all know that no two families are the same. Our support for working mothers and families must be accessible to each and every Australian family's individual circumstances. That is why the provisions of this bill are designed to encourage a greater uptake of paid parental leave entitlements by secondary carers, who but for this support would likely not have the opportunity to spend quality time with their children during those important formative years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my view, there is nothing more important than family, howsoever it is defined. Family members provide the unconditional support and comfort necessary for the nurturing of a child. In reflecting on the intent of this bill, I am reminded of what Haniel Long wrote in his book <span style="font-style:italic;">A Letter to St Augustine After Re Reading His Confessions</span>:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So much of what is best in us is bound up in our love of family, that it remains the measure of our stability because it measures our sense of loyalty. All other pacts of love or fear derive from it and are modeled upon it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Party firmly believes that the family is the foundation stone of a strong and vibrant Australian society. Even as we face the unprecedented times of the present, family remains a constant upon which those of us fortunate enough can rely. That is why, by enabling working mothers, including those who are self-employed or who own a small business, to access a more flexible paid parental leave arrangement, the coalition government is supporting mothers to manage the responsibilities of work and raising a family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay special tribute to those working women who run a small or family business. This bill will allow them to tailor their paid parental leave to their own circumstances and enable the business they have worked so hard to build to continue to operate. It provides further support for families who face the competing pressures of parenthood and enterprise, because these two important endeavours, wherever possible, should not be mutually exclusive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind honourable senators of the attempt some years ago by those opposite at a paid parental leave scheme which resulted in significant additional workloads for those thousands of businesses as they struggled to work their way through myriad regulations and red tape. The coalition government is committed to providing an important safety net for Australian mothers, supporting the health and wellbeing of their children and providing the flexibility to allow families to decide how best to care for their children. Not only do the changes outlined in the bill provide more flexible arrangements for families; they assist businesses to retain their valued staff in the workforce. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="ZN4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HENDERSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  I rise today in support of the Paid Parental Leave Amendment (Flexibility Measures) Bill 2020. This bill introduces changes to the Paid Parental Leave scheme aimed at better supporting working mothers and families—and working fathers—to access their payment more flexibly. There are around 300,000 births in Australia each year, with nearly half of all new mothers accessing paid parental leave. Our government understands the important role of paid parental leave in supporting the health and wellbeing of mothers and babies and in encouraging workforce participation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To this end, the measures in the bill introduce greater flexibility to support working women, including self-employed women and small business owners who cannot afford to leave their businesses for 18 consecutive weeks. The Paid Parental Leave scheme provides an important safety net for nearly half of all new mothers, supporting them to take time off work to spend with their newborn or newly adopted children. Under this measure, we will continue to support the important objectives of the Paid Parental Leave scheme whilst offering families flexibility and choice about when to access their payment, in order to support them to find a better balance between family and work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes support thousands of working women and men who cannot afford to leave their employment or business for 18 consecutive weeks. Currently, if a parent returns to work before they have received their full entitlement of parental leave pay they lose eligibility for the remainder of the payment. That is fundamentally unfair. We will continue to support women to rest and recover in the months immediately after the birth of their child by allowing them to use 12 weeks of their entitlement within 12 months of the birth of their child. Then the remaining six weeks can be used flexibly any time within two years of the birth or adoption in blocks as small as one day at a time. These measures will provide much greater flexibility and will benefit in particular self-employed women and women who are small business owners by providing greater flexibility as to when they can take time away from work. This increased flexibility and ability to balance work and caring responsibilities will, I am sure, encourage greater uptake of leave by secondary carers, in turn contributing to changing social norms around sharing care and also encouraging more men to take parental leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that not all families are the same, and this bill makes important improvements to the Paid Parental Leave scheme that provide inherent and much greater flexibility to ensure that we can continue to support that great institution in our society, the family, no matter what form or shape each person's family comes in. So I commend these changes to the Senate and, of course, it reflects the ongoing work of our government in improving women's economic security, which has been a very key focus of the Liberal and National government for the last six and more years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, we're in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic and it's a very challenging time for so many families. But our government is working around the clock to ensure that we focus on saving lives and livelihoods and, of course, on rebuilding our economy as soon as we possibly can. There has been a bit of discussion in the Senate this morning about the gender pay gap, which I am pleased to report is moving in the right direction—down to a record low of 14 per cent from 17.2 per cent under the previous Labor government. While, of course, 14 per cent is not good enough, we didn't hear from Labor senators this morning any acknowledgement that it was actually quite considerably worse under Labor when it was in government and that we are in fact making some real strides under our government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this progress, there are of course some significant challenges. There are still around two million working-age women not in the labour force. Women are more than twice as likely to work part-time as men and, as they near retiring age, there is around a 32 per cent gap in superannuation balances. The new childcare subsidy is making child care more accessible and affordable for around one million parents. That's obviously a very important change that we have brought about, providing much greater equity and much greater support for families. And, of course, at the moment we know that we're offering, as a government, free child care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The childcare subsidy has been suspended during the coronavirus pandemic, and that is, of course, to support as many families and childcare centres as possible at this very difficult time. But I do want to place on the record that the Morrison government is investing record funding of something in excess of $8 billion this financial year and increasing this investment to $10 billion in the coming years to support child care. This has seen, on average, a 4.2 per cent reduction in out-of-pocket costs since June 2018 for families who use child care. The typical family is around $1,300 better off per child per year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of other very significant ways in which we are supporting women in particular. The ParentsNext program is supporting vulnerable parents, mostly women, to break the welfare cycle and get back into work. There has been enormous investment in women's safety, and we are very, very proud of our incredible investments in women's safety. Some $852 million has been spent since 2013 to support women and children—and, I acknowledge, some men—who are victims of, or at risk of, domestic violence. That comes in a whole lot of different ways—from improving frontline services to supporting and funding specialist domestic violence providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a very significant investment in our National Housing and Homelessness Agreement. There are huge investments in improving the legal system, including in a very important initiative—one that I was a huge supporter of—and that is banning the direct cross-examination of family law proceedings where there are allegations of family violence. There have also been enormous investments in the better use of technology to keep principally women and children safe. We now have the National Domestic Violence Order Scheme as well. So an enormous amount of investment has gone into supporting women and children, and I don't want to be gender specific on that. Of course, some men also suffer family violence. But enormous investment has gone into this issue to really improve the lives of all families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge that our government has guaranteed a minimum entitlement of five days unpaid family and domestic violence leave per year for six million employees covered by the Fair Work Act. So it's my great pleasure to support this bill. This is a very significant change, which will obviously bring about much greater flexibility and support for working parents. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

The Paid Parental Leave Amendment (Flexibility Measures) Bill 2020 introduces reforms aimed at better supporting working mothers and their families to access paid parental leave more flexibly to support choice about balancing work and family. Currently, parental leave pay can only be taken as a continuous 18-week block within the first 12 months after the birth or adoption of a child. From 1 July 2020, families will be able to split their paid parental leave into blocks of leave over a two-year period, allowing for periods of work in between.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Parents will be able to use an initial 12-week block of their entitlement anytime within the first 12 months after the birth or adoption of their child. This gives parents a period of recuperation and bonding in the months immediately following the birth or adoption. Parents will then be able to take their remaining entitlement of up to six weeks anytime before their child turns two years old and can return to work anytime during this time. This measure preserves the total of 18 weeks that is currently allowed, but offers much greater flexibility in how it is used. The changes will help thousands of new parents who currently need to return to work before they have used all of their paid parental leave. Instead of losing unused leave, these families will now have greater flexibility to take their leave at a time that suits the needs of their family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government recognises that not all self-employed women and small-business owners can afford to leave their businesses for 18 consecutive weeks. The increased flexibility will also make it easier for mothers who are eligible for paid parental leave to transfer the entitlement to eligible partners who take on the role of primary carer where it suits the family's circumstances. Importantly, this increased flexibility and ability to balance work and caring responsibilities may encourage greater uptake of leave by secondary carers, in turn contributing to changing social norms around sharing care and encouraging men to take parental leave. We know that not all families are the same, and this bill makes important improvements to the paid parental leave scheme that gives families more flexibility to balance work and caring responsibilities in a way that best suits their needs. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

Is it the wish of the committee that the statements accompanying the circulated requests be incorporated in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> immediately after the requests to which they relate? There being no objection, it is so ordered. The question is that the bill be agreed to without amendments or requests. </span>

The bill originally had a provision for prebirth claiming between 1 April 2020 and 1 July 2020 to ensure the claims could be made in the three months leading up to the commencement date. Due to COVID-19 and the change to the parliamentary sitting schedule, it was not possible to have this bill pass the parliament before 1 April. The start date of the changes has not moved from 1 July; however, prebirth claims will also only be possible from 1 July 2020 instead of the intended date of 1 April 2020.</span>

Do you have an indication of how many people who might be about to commence paid parental leave in the next couple of months would already have been impacted in terms of not meeting that work test? I've certainly been contacted by constituents. That is not a 13-month period which is contingent on how much the economy picks up or doesn't pick up and therefore impacts on how much of the work test impacts on your work test modelling. What is the current impact, as of now, in terms of those who would otherwise have been receiving PPL, if they were commencing their PPL now or in the next couple of months?</span>

We do understand that eligibility is forecast over a 13-month period, but we certainly know of families that are looking ahead now to a couple of months time, where they know they have lost their eligibility because they have lost work recently and therefore they don't meet the 10 out of 13 months eligibility, I think it is, for that work test. I really don't understand why you don't have any indication of the data that might give you an indication of the number of people affected. You've said that the data hasn't come in. But is that data calculated on general unemployment data and extrapolated? How do you usually calculate how many people you expect to be receiving it? Are you really saying that you don't calculate that for another 13 months time in the past? If, as you said, you can't calculate it for another year, that's not an estimate of how many people are about to receive it, which clearly the government needs to be able to do.</span>

We know it's had an unprecedented impact in particular on women's workforce participation, and even the government has been able to acknowledge to some extent that that's an issue. Have you not made any attempt yet to quantify what that impact actually looks like and to translate it into, frankly, all the various eligibility thresholds, whether it's for jobseeker payments or situations where people change their family tax benefit status because they have lost work and therefore they've lost income? Clearly the government has to be grappling with these issues now to be able to look at the debt and the impact of the policy decisions and the current economic crisis on households and the Australian economy?</span>

So JobKeeper is relevant in the sense that you want to maintain that workforce participation connection using JobKeeper. But these are women who are about to take a pause from their work, or dads who are about to take a pause from their work, because they're accessing paid parental leave. It is of course an objective to keep parents who have children connected to their employers. Is that not also an important objective for people who have also been dislocated from the workforce but who might be in casual roles?</span>

The answer to that question was that the rationale was based on the premise of maintaining that connection to employment. In terms of casuals, you'd be aware that casuals who have been in a continuous period of employment with their employer for 12 months or more, based on the definition of the Fair Work Act, are entitled to JobKeeper. As such, there will be some casuals who are afforded the benefit of this rationale.</span>

What advice would you give to the families who had otherwise banked on having this income because they were going to meet the work test? They've lost their jobs recently, they're about to have a baby and many of these families are now looking at needing to draw down on superannuation because they've lost employment. What advice would you give these families who are now managing an insecure economic future at the same time as expecting a baby?</span>

In fact, our amendment would fix the problem that we've been discussing. As has been articulated, if you lost your job because of COVID, but you weren't eligible for JobKeeper, for whatever reason, now you're also not eligible for paid parental leave. We think that's unfair and it's very easily fixed. Amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 8927, which I will move provide that, if through no fault of your own you've lost your job because of COVID-19 but you had expected to otherwise remain in employment and be eligible for PPL, then you should still be eligible for PPL.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly for the number-crunchers over there, that won't increase the budget draw because those people were projected to be eligible for PPL anyway. The whole lengthy discussion we've just had actually boils down to the fact that those projections won't have changed. You're basing it on population projections, so those projections will be the same. The same people who would have been entitled to PPL when their employer existed but who, unfortunately, because of coronavirus now have no work will miss out. It's an easy fix, and it won't have any budget implications, so I am interested in knowing why the government isn't supporting this amendment, since it won't cost you any more than it otherwise would. Could you answer that, Minister, before we deal with the amendments?</span>

You would be aware that, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government moved quickly to introduce amendments to the Paid Parental Leave Act to allow the time that people spend on the JobKeeper payment to count towards the paid parental leave work test, as I have described in responding to questions from Senator Pratt. The proposed amendment that you have moved has the potential to allow people with a non-genuine claim to be eligible for paid parental leave—for example, people who may have already been planning to leave work irrespective of the impact of COVID-19. The proposed amendment that you have moved would also increase the evidence required for submitting a claim for paid parental leave, adding to the administrative burden including for employers who may be called on to speculate about the work intention of claimants and what amount of work they would have asked claimants to do, but for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. There would be no way for Services Australia to independently verify these claims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments that you have moved also add a new provision that would allow the secretary to determine that a person would have met the paid parental leave work test if it were not for the impact of an emergency services event. The amendment also allows the minister to declare an event to be such an event and to declare the coronavirus outbreak an emergency circumstances event. In these situations, a person would be deemed to be working the hours they would have been working pre the COVID-19 impacts. The approach is similar to that currently applied to people who do not meet the work test due to a pregnancy related complication or illness, or a premature birth. However, these events are relatively rare and easily verified. The amendments that you have proposed would also require assessments on a significantly greater scale, creating additional administrative burden, including for employers. On that basis, the government will not be supporting the amendments that have now been formally moved by the Australian Greens.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  Minister, I want to take you up on a few of those points. Firstly, the claim that there would be non-genuine claims sounds to me a lot like you were just saying women are going to lie. We do hear that from your side of the chamber quite a bit. It's still not okay and it's also not right. I ask you to reconsider whether you really want to assert that women are going to make up the fact that either they are pregnant or they were otherwise going to leave the job or stay on the job, because that's just playing a trope that's very unhelpful and is actually quite dangerous, as I would hope you know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You then talked about speculation on work intention. These people have a contract, so there's no need for speculation on their intention. They are employed. Were it not for COVID, they would be entitled to receive paid parental leave because they are employed. I genuinely don't understand how you think there's some speculation required as to their employment situation or their intention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, on the point that this would somehow require additional paperwork: these are the same people who otherwise would have been eligible for PPL. They might now have to put in a different form. It's not like there are going to be additional people. The only thing that has changed is the pandemic. The number of people has not changed. Just their eligibility to get any support from this government is what has changed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You noted that you have made JobKeeper count for the purposes of PPL eligibility. I'm aware of that, and we welcome that. But there is actually no real reason for you not to also extend PPL eligibility to people who would have been eligible were it not for the pandemic. It gets a bit confusing, but I think people understand the point. It's not their fault that their business has either gone bust or chosen not to offer JobKeeper, or they are not eligible because your government won't extend JobKeeper to the number of people that it should; namely, casuals, people on temporary visas, students—the works. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a sense you are hoisted on your own petard. You are trying to use that as an excuse to say they don't deserve help. They do deserve help. I don't accept your premise that women are going to lie about their employment situation or their reproductive health status. I'd like a further response on why you're not simply going to do the right thing here and give people the money they would have otherwise been entitled to.</span>

Just in relation to the savings that you will now make, you're making savings off the back of pregnant women. When did that become okay? You're not going to let people that otherwise would have been eligible for PPL, were it not for the pandemic, that are now not eligible have the PPL, because you think they might have been intending to leave work anyway. Sounds an awful lot like making savings off the back of pregnant women. Can I get an explanation on how much money you're expecting to save by denying those people the payment they would have otherwise been entitled to?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:35</span>):  This discussion has highlighted for me another significant issue in relation to pregnant women meeting the work test. Pregnancy discrimination is, of course, known to happen in Australia. Clearly, if you have a permanent contract and you're employed then you have some protections. However, if you're a casual employee your shifts can suddenly drop off because of that pregnancy discrimination. Has the government done any assessment of the issues around someone meeting the work test when they otherwise would have met it—they're not leaving a job or dropping shifts of their own accord by choice but rather are experiencing pregnancy discrimination and insecure work rights and therefore do not meet the work test?</span>

Because you might simply stop getting shifts rather than—we know that this commonly happens when people are discriminated against at work. I've seen many examples of it, and it's very difficult to mount a discrimination case under those circumstances.</span>

The current rules just don't reflect the realities of modern parenting, with more dads staying at home to care for children. The number of stay-at-home fathers has grown to 80,000 in 2016, based on the latest census data. It is time to move away from models that assume children will be cared for by a primary carer who is the mother. Modern parents don't define themselves in this way, and it's time the legislation doesn't either. Minister, do you concede that the rule which unfairly penalises high-income earning mums and stay-at-home dads by tying eligibility to the birth mother is a discriminatory and sexist rule?</span>

The time-critical nature of this bill, which, as you are aware, provides critical flexibility in paid parental leave, precludes the government from considering other changes to the scheme at this time. Any changes to the means-testing arrangements would require consultation and investigation to ensure we strike the right balance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is committed to delivering on measures that were announced in 2018 as part of the Women's Economic Security Statement that improve the flexibility of the Paid Parental Leave scheme. The proposed amendment that you have moved on behalf of Centre Alliance seeks to enable biological fathers or the partner of the birth mother to claim paid parental leave where the mother does not satisfy the paid parental leave income test. This would have the effect of enabling partners of high-income mothers—that is, above $150,000—to access paid parental leave, subject to the partner meeting the income and work tests. Whilst the proposal would address, as you've said, perceived gender bias in the PPL scheme, it would come at a cost to government and be providing increased support to higher-income families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Women who are on a higher income and are primary carers are generally in a stronger position to obtain family-friendly benefits as part of their conditions of employment. Further, the requirement in the PPL scheme for a mother to have primary eligibility for parental leave pay reflects that the payment is primarily designed to assist mothers to take time out of the workforce to care for their newborn or recently adopted child, to enhance the health and development of the child and to allow time for the mother to recover from the birth. Whilst we remain open to discussion about further opportunities for improvement, our critical and immediate concern is delivering on the commitment for increased flexibility that has been widely supported.</span>

Whilst I appreciate, as you said, that it may take time to consult with others, this change is very minor and, in fact, is fully costed by the PBO. It's around $27 million in the forward estimates. This has a very minor cost impact on your budget, but it just sets everything straight—it sets everything right. It removes this sexist rule. Given that part of your statement also said that it's something that perhaps should be looked at—but then it slightly contradicts itself as well a bit further on—can you advise whether government is looking at options that will actually take into account either combined family income or looking at this very issue in the reasonable future?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:54</span>):  Minister, my previous question was: are you considering looking at any other form of legislation to incorporate combined family income or fix this particular issue that I've referred to? That's my first question. My second question relates to the statement you made that the cost was $27 million a year. That is incorrect. The PBO costing out to 2022-23 totals $27.3 million, but, in each individual year, it's around $7 million to $9 million. I can table this PBO document, if that is appropriate, Chair; but it is not $27 million a year.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:05</span>):  I rise to speak on the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment (Enhancing Australia's Anti-Doping Capability) Bill 2019. The past few months have presented unprecedented challenges for Australia's sports sector. The appropriate and necessary public health measures put in place to stop the spread of COVID-19 have forced the shutdown of very nearly all sporting activities at all levels from the grassroots to our elite competitions. Over the past fortnight, we've started to see the staged resumption of certain activities, including the return of sport. These small but important steps are encouraging to the Australian sporting clubs and organisations. But, just like other aspects of our lives, we know it will take some time for the Australian sporting landscape to look anything like it did before this global health and economic crisis hit. The ongoing impact on sport makes it more important than ever that we do everything we can to protect the integrity of sport. This bill seeks to do that by strengthening Australia's capacity to prevent, detect and deal with doping in sport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians love their sport, and many of us can't wait to again be inspired by our favourite teams and athletes in local and national competitions and the international sporting stage. My team is resuming this Saturday night.</span>

                    </a>  No, the Adelaide Crows will wipe out Port Adelaide, I'm sure, at Adelaide Oval in front of the 2,000 lucky people who are going to be there—only 500 Adelaide Crows supporters, unfortunately, because it's a Port Adelaide home game. I see the contribution from the former sports minister there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They love their sport, and when sport returns these achievements will again bring us together, uphold the reputation of Australian sport and make us love it even more. Those things, which we hold dear and have sorely missed over the past couple of months, are threatened whenever revelations of doping are reported. Australians value fair play and expect a level playing field in sport. Our confidence in the integrity of sport is undermined by doping. Doping leads us to question whether the sporting events we love to watch are really being contested on a truly level playing field. In government, Labor recognised the need to upgrade and update Australia's antidoping regime to keep up with new and evolving risks. For instance, in 2012 the federal Labor government established the National Integrity of Sport Unit, and in 2013 we passed legislation to strengthen the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sports doping threatens to continue to constantly evolve, so it's important that Australia's protective measures are regularly reviewed and, if required, updated. In response to those ever-changing risks, in August 2017 the government announced a review of Australia's sports integrity arrangements. The review panel was chaired by Justice James Wood, and its report has become known as the Wood review. After receiving the Wood review in March 2018, the government released its response in February 2019. The review was detailed and extensive—nearly 300 pages containing 52 recommendations. One of those recommendations directly relates to this bill. Recommendation 18 states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority's regulatory role and engagement with sports in relation to the audit and enforcement of sport's compliance with anti-doping rules and approved policies be enhanced by establishing regulatory compliance powers exercisable by the proposed National Sports Integrity Commission in collaboration with (and at the request of) the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority CEO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to implement recommendation 18. The review also recommends retaining ASADA as Australia's national antidoping organisation. However, the government has decided to bring antidoping operations under the umbrella of a new agency, Sports Integrity Australia. This legislation to establish the agency passed both houses of parliament in February this year and was given assent in March. ASADA has said it supports the inclusion of antidoping activities in the remit of Sport Integrity Australia, and that move is supported by the majority of Australia's sporting organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports measures designed to protect the integrity of Australian sport and supported the passage of this bill through the House of Representatives last year. However, stakeholders, including the Australian Athletes Alliance, the AAA, have raised concerns with us about the impact some sections of the bill might have on individual rights. In response, Labor has worked closely with stakeholders towards a better balance between stronger antidoping capabilities and the athletes' individual rights. Initially, we sought detailed briefings on the first version of the bill from the office of the former Minister for Sport, Senator McKenzie, and that was willingly provided, and officials involved in drafting the bill. We continued that process with Senator Colbeck, who took over the portfolio after the last election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor initiated the referral of the bill by the Senate to the Community Affairs Committee for a short inquiry, which reported earlier this year. We did that to give stakeholders an opportunity to outline issues relating to certain specific aspects of this bill. Concerns raised during the inquiry and with Labor directly have largely related to the potential for some aspects of the bill to unfairly impact on individual rights. One of the most consistently raised stakeholder concerns has been the lowering of the threshold for the disclosure notice from reasonable belief to reasonable suspicion. Athletes groups have suggested that lowering the threshold would effectively deny athletes protections that are offered to criminal suspects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stakeholders have pointed out that complying with disclosure notices, including accessing legal advice, can be costly and time-consuming. Many athletes, particularly those in Olympic sports, are not on six- or seven-figure salaries like those attracted by the stars of some of our local codes, for example. They don't have the resources to secure legal representation for complicated processes which, under this bill in its current form, could be initiated with a lower threshold than that required for serious criminal investigations. Representative bodies argue that putting athletes in a position where such costs are incurred merely on the basis of reasonable suspicion is unfair. The scrutiny committee has queried the need for the changes and asked why a reasonable belief could not be formed on the basis of intelligence gathered while investigating a potential antidoping breach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor flagged, during the debate on this bill in the other place, that we might seek to move amendments to this bill in the Senate if we believe that the matters raised in the committee inquiry required changes. We do think that change is needed. Let me be clear: Labor supports strong antidoping measures in sport, but we also support the intent of this bill to strengthen Australia's defences against doping in sport and look forward to continuing our commitment to that goal. But if the balance between the necessary new and enhanced powers and the rights of individuals can be improved then they should be. Stakeholders believe maintaining the current threshold would lessen the potential for unintended cumulative impacts on individual athletes' rights that could result from the combination of a lower threshold and other sections of the bill. That's why it's Labor's intention to move an amendment to this bill that would maintain the current threshold of reasonable belief for the issuing of the disclosure notice. We have sought to work constructively with stakeholders and throughout the parliament to improve the balance of this bill, and we hope to gain the support of the Senate to do that whilst still ensuring strong anti-doping regimes to protect Australia's integrity in sport.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DI NATALE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:14</span>):  I rise today to speak about the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment (Enhancing Australia's Anti-Doping Capability) Bill 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we think of ourselves as Australians, we often think of ourselves as a sporting nation. There is a lot to be proud of there: 14 million of us participate in sport annually and almost two million people volunteer each year in a whole range of different ways. They might be involved in their local football, soccer, netball, cricket, rugby league, rugby union, basketball, swimming or athletics club, and it goes on and on and on. We love our sport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to do everything we can to protect that wonderful sporting culture. We have to make sure that we support community sport, but we also have to ensure that there is integrity at the highest levels in sport. We know that that trust can be shattered when we learn that a high-profile athlete—someone who kids look up to—has been found cheating. They undermine people's faith in a really important institution for all Australians. That's not fair, and Australians want a level playing field when it comes to engagement in sport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course there are lots of things that can challenge the integrity of our sporting culture. This bill addresses the issue of doping violations, but the Wood review, as was mentioned in the earlier contribution from Senator Farrell, went well beyond anti-doping violations to the whole issue of the commercialisation of sport. For example: there is the rise in sports betting, which has resulted in the manipulation of outcomes and, again, further undermining of the integrity of sport. So, from the outset, it is absolutely critical that we see a level playing field, that we make sure that all athletes are participating fairly and doing what they do because they love what they do—that they are doing it honestly and are able to compete on a level playing field. We need to do everything we can to stop people who game the system, who manipulate the system and who cheat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we do have to think about it as a system. It's not just an athlete in isolation. As I've said previously in this place, modern sport is an industry. It's big business, and athletes don't compete on their own. I often listen to Ash Barty, one of Australia's most significant figures, I think, in Australian sport over the past decade. You rarely hear Ash Barty talk about herself as Ash Barty the individual; it's always 'our team'. High-profile athletes are almost always part of a much bigger team—they're surrounded by coaches, trainers, nutritionists and physios, and a whole range of other support staff. I said this when we were debating an earlier bill: it's true that athletes will always bear ultimate responsibility for what goes into their bodies, and pay the price when mistakes are made. But if athletes and entire teams are found to have wandered into the doping grey areas and beyond, it's as much an organisational failure—a systems failure—as a case of individual cheating by athletes. So we need to consider that context; that context is absolutely critical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I actually heard from a range of former athletes when I was engaged previously in this portfolio and was prosecuting a previous bill. What we've heard was that athletes find this system very invasive. It's intense and it exposes them to a level of scrutiny that very few people can imagine. They're required to frequently report their whereabouts. Holidays are really hard to organise—they have to be available for testing. They basically have to have their sport control all aspects of their lives; their diary has to be absolutely coordinated with any potential for testing, and it makes life difficult. Most people do it, and they do it voluntarily and willingly because they love what they do, but it does provide a huge challenge for many athletes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of most concern, we've heard from athletes who've received antidoping violations for missing an appointment for absolutely valid reasons. We've heard from athletes who have provided a sample but have left competition because they needed to get home and have received a sanction for not providing a second sample, even though the first sample might have been clean. If an athlete has enough of those warnings, it has a huge impact on their career, even though they participate honestly and with integrity and there's no question about whether they actually engage in cheating. So, given the concerns that have been raised with us, it's important that we scrutinise all of the proposed changes to this bill and understand what their impact is on decent people: the athletes who do what they love, and who do it so that we can enjoy watching them excel in their chosen sport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013 I was successful in securing amendments to an ASADA bill that protected an athlete's right to silence. At the time I said it was my view that the privilege against self-incrimination was fundamental to our democratic system of justice and that forcing an athlete or support personnel to give evidence, even if it could compromise their own career, flew in the face of this principle. Senator Farrell said this earlier. This is a right we afford to criminals and to people who are facing criminal charges. If it's a right that's afforded to people who are facing criminal charges, then surely it's a right that should be afforded to athletes. It's a fundamental legal principle. We do support a better system, a fairer system, but we do have to scrutinise the detail of this bill very, very clearly. We do have some concerns about some of the matters that are reflected in this bill, and it's for that reason that we'll be proposing some amendments shortly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take a moment to talk about some of the processes in ASADA's work. An important process in legal terms is its use of disclosure notices. As the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bills Digest</span> explains:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">ASADA has power to issue a disclosure notice to compel certain persons to attend for questioning and to produce documents and things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ASADA can enforce its disclosure notices with civil penalties. It's an important part of the investigative power that ASADA uses, and there are very clear parameters around disclosure notices because the use of those disclosure notices has a very direct impact on the lives of athletes and on their experiences of interacting with what is a very complex system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the changes in this bill is that it would lower the threshold required for the CEO of ASADA to issue a disclosure notice. At the moment, the CEO has to have a 'reasonable belief' that a person has 'information, documents or things that may be relevant to the administration of the NAD scheme', the National Anti-Doping Scheme, before issuing a disclosure notice. We think that's appropriate. But what this bill does is change the notion of a 'reasonable belief' to that of a 'reasonable suspicion'. What's a suspicion? Is it a hunch? If someone's performance has improved over a period of time and we have a hunch they might be cheating, we might issue a disclosure notice. We are very concerned that, in lowering the threshold for disclosure notices to a 'reasonable suspicion', it is actually setting the threshold for the use of what is a very significant power far too low.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You only have to talk to the various key stakeholders to know just how concerned they are. The Australian Athletes' Alliance noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The breadth of the information that can be requested in a disclosure notice is broad. Given that compliance may place a significant burden the person receiving a disclosure notice, it is reasonable to require that the CEO actually believe that the disclosure notice will yield relevant information. A suspicion, which is tantamount to a hunch, even if reasonable, is not enough to require an athlete to provide their personal data, phone, computer, bank accounts, and other private information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the view of the Australian Athletes' Alliance. I think it's one that is absolutely reasonable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also a second aspect of the changes to disclosure notices that we've got concerns about. The bill will make it harder for athletes to access the document retained by the CEO, changing their rights to access it from 'at such times that the person would ordinarily be able to do so' to 'at such times and places as the CEO thinks appropriate'. So we think it's reasonable that, if ASADA has significant powers to issue these disclosure notices, there's some transparency and that athletes have the right to access that information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My colleague Senator Rice has also spoken to many of the people who've struggled with this system and with knowing what information is being relied on as they navigate what's a very complex process. They have had their phones accessed. They've faced significant bureaucratic hurdles just to find out what information has been taken off their phones. Of course there's a role for appropriate investigations to make sure the system's fair, but it should be fair and it should be transparent, and it's reasonable that athletes be able to access the information that's provided via disclosure notices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, when we secured the changes I mentioned earlier in the previous legislation, we also secured the right to silence in that legislation. This bill removes that right—that is, athletes would no longer be able to refuse to answer questions under a disclosure notice because it would self-incriminate. Again, that's something that we afford in the justice system to people accused of criminal charges. But, despite the fact that we secured that in previous legislation, what we're finding now is that the governing bodies are using contracts as a way to impose a requirement that athletes self-incriminate in response to a disclosure notice. What that effectively does is take away their right to silence. So what you're seeing is an undermining of legislative protection via the use of contracts. Athletes use their right to silence when they sign a contract to play a particular sport. It's a separate question, and it's not really one for this bill, but it's something we are concerned about and something that should be addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another part of the process is that currently the ASADA CEO has to have the approval of the Anti-Doping Rule Violation Panel before issuing the disclosure notices. We're persuaded by the views of stakeholders that the panel hasn't added much in the way of oversight, but we think it's important that athletes retain the right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. They might not be able to appeal the panel's decision to the AAT, but we think they should retain the right to appeal the ASADA CEO's decision to the AAT and we're going to move an amendment to that affect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another amendment ensures that there would be some protection for national sporting organisations from civil liability where the actions are in line with the National Anti-Doping Scheme. That protection would extend more broadly. Again, I'd like to quote the Australian Athletes Alliance, who say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We oppose this amendment because it would deny an athlete any recourse if they suffer a loss as a result of their NSO's—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">national sporting organisation's—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">breach of its duty of care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Even for an athlete who is exonerated, the ramifications of an anti-doping matter on their career, mental health, and reputation can be substantial. Accordingly, an NSO must be required to exercise due care and, if it fails to do so, an athlete should be able to hold it to account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard of athletes who are not able to compete after circumstances beyond their control, such as, as I said earlier, not being able to provide a second sample because they had to catch a flight, even though their first sample was clean. There are lots and lots of stories. Some of them are from household names, people who have competed internationally. Some are competing in their spare time on top of full-time work. There's an example that's in the news at the moment—the sample taken from Bronson Xerri in November 2019 where the results weren't released until months later in 2020. Of course where there's a reasonable suspicion it's appropriate to conduct an investigation, but surely it should be timely and transparent given the impact it's going to have on that person's life?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, there's an amendment that would establish an ombudsman to support athletes. We think that's important. The legislation that's been passed by this place is significant. It will result in major changes to the sports integrity framework. We think there should be an athletes ombudsman established. Again, we want a clear system and we want a level playing field, but we also want to ensure some basic fundamental rights for athletes who are under investigation. So we support the overall objective the government is pursuing, but we will be moving amendments to make the system fairer. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="207825" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:30</span>):  Like Senator Di Natale and Senator Farrell, I am rapt that the true code starts again tonight and we'll have AFL back on our TVs. The southern states are very excited about that. Haven't we missed it? I am just thinking about the impact of COVID on community sport and our representative athletes who were hoping to head off to the Tokyo Olympics. We've missed Wimbledon this year. There have been a whole raft of things that are part of not only our daily lives, if you are involved in community sport, but our national identity on the international stage. Like everyone else who has contributed to debate on this bill, the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment (Enhancing Australia's Anti-Doping Capability) Bill 2019, I am very much looking forward to community sport and our international sporting arrangements getting back on track.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Enhancing Australia's antidoping capabilities is incredibly important when it comes to sporting integrity. Our young Australians look up to our athletes and our sporting stars as model citizens for how to conduct themselves, how to understand sportsmanship and fairness and how to play in teams—key skills and characteristics they need for life. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As others have mentioned, sport is also big business. A huge number of people right across our economy are employed in sport. Volunteering levels are through the roof. Sport participation assists with great health and social outcomes. As I said earlier, it also instils national pride as we see Australian athletes and teams always punching—or riding, swimming or running—above their weight, which makes us very proud. We also are known globally for not just being hard at it on the track, in the pool or on the field but also being champions of fair play, a fair go and integrity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sport has shaped our culture and identity as Australians and reflects our broader values of sportsmanship and respect for the umpire. It unites our nation like nothing else, bringing people with diverse political views and people from different geographies and cultures together to celebrate our success as one. From grassroots to the world's iconic grass courts and arenas, sport gives us our heroes. We celebrate Steven Bradbury not only because he won a winter Olympics gold medal but because he was there against all the odds and stood tall as those around him fell. From Betty Cuthbert to Louise Sauvage, we share Australia's victories and we expect a level playing field. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill really puts us as Australians as leading the world in setting up a sports integrity system. On 5 August 2017 the then sports minister, Greg Hunt, announced a review of Australia's sports integrity arrangements to be led by Justice James Wood QC. I had the great privilege to release that Wood review in August 2018. It was a key component in the development of Australia's first comprehensive national sports plan, Sport 2030. I thank James Wood and his fellow panel members for their efforts in producing the most comprehensive review of Australia's sports integrity arrangements ever conducted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wood review found that doping is much more prevalent and widespread than ever among athletes at all levels. We often think of the high-profile examples that have been mentioned in contributions thus far, but the Wood review found that teams at the amateur level and in junior competitions were being affected and that we really needed a strong system of monitoring and compliance right across the sporting landscape to ensure that those young athletes were protected. The Wood review also found serious and organised crime was involved in match fixing and the supply of performance-enhancing drugs. Under our nation's first sports plan, Sport 2030, we now have a clear path to know what is needed to ensure we build a more active Australia, achieve sporting excellence and back community grassroots sports at the same time, but we must safeguard the integrity of sport, which this bill seeks to achieve. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The election and subsequent introduction of this bill into parliament post-election last year has allowed for additional consultation with stakeholders in both private and public sectors, and as a result we now have greater clarity and context to the proposed amendments in the bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the bill's first introduction in the previous parliament changes have been made to allow ASADA's secrecy provisions to be included within schedule 3 of the Freedom of Information Act and very minor and consequential amendments to harmonise operations within the Sport Integrity Australia bill. The proposed amendments will streamline administrative procedures in relation to antidoping rule violations and reduce the burden on sports athletes and support personnel. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments are supported by the feedback of stakeholders and include the removal of the Anti-Doping Rule Violation Panel from the rule violation process and the removal of a pathway for review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of a preliminary antidoping rule violation decision of the ASADA CEO. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments, along with the previously introduced National Sports Tribunal Bill, are a complementary package of reforms. The ultimate decision as to whether a person has committed a violation will be made by a fair, independent, impartial decision-maker. This government is implementing vital reforms to safeguard the integrity of Australian sport and combat present, emerging and future threats, including doping, match fixing, illegal betting, organised crime and corruption. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms include establishing a new single national sport integrity agency, Sport Integrity Australia, which brings together ASADA, the National Integrity of Sport Unit and national sports integrity functions of Sport Australia. Legislation establishing Sport Integrity Australia was passed by the Senate in February this year. It stipulates the start of the new agency on 1 July 2020, and that will be headed by David Sharpe OAM. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sport Integrity Australia will focus on regulation, monitoring and intelligence, policy and program delivery, including education and outreach. Sports betting integrity capabilities will be maintained with ongoing support of the world-leading Sports Betting Integrity Unit within the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has established the National Sports Tribunal, which began operations in March this year. That's been created to provide a transparent, independent and cost-effective resolution to sports disputes. The National Sports Tribunal will be trialled over two years and comprises an antidoping division, a general division and an appeals division. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government's record on safeguarding sport is there for the world to see. In February last year, on behalf of the Australian government, I signed the Macolin convention—and it's great to see the foreign minister, who was with me on the day, Senator Marise Payne. It's the only multilateral treaty specifically aimed at combating match fixing and other related corruption in sport. What we do know is that organised crime doesn't restrict itself to state or national boundaries. This is a worldwide problem, and we need to work with other jurisdictions to actually mitigate the impacts and ensure that sport is fair for all. The Macolin convention is a great step forward in that effort to protect the safety, fairness and integrity of the sporting competitions we all enjoy so much. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Membership of the Macolin community enables Australia to obtain formal ongoing access to international counterparts and meetings to work together and drive these measures to combat sport corruption at a global level. Signing the convention supports national match-fixing criminal legislation and complements similar laws, where they exist, within our states and territories to protect sport. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The integrity of sport is of paramount importance, and our athletes expect to compete on a level playing field. We want them to compete on a level playing field, because we know we as Australians do alright on a level playing field. As I said earlier, sport keeps us fit and healthy. It's the social glue that binds us together. It creates communities and underpins much of community life, especially for those of us that live in the regions. Boston Consulting Group did a review of Australian sport in 2017 and it showed that every year 14 million Australians participate in some form of sporting activity. As I said earlier, sport generates in excess of $40 billion of economic activity, making upwards of three per cent of our GDP—equivalent to our agriculture sector. So we're not only just good at it, it underpins a lot of our economic activity, and a lot of Australians are employed within our sporting industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Each year the Australian government invests more than $300 million to support our high-performance athletes as they prepare for a variety of international competitions, and for pathways for younger athletes as they seek to aspire to the very highest levels of sporting prowess. I'm very proud of our government's record of investing millions to encourage greater participation at the community and grassroots levels in sport. We had a raft of measures under Sport 2030, including community infrastructure investment to help sporting clubs build those change rooms to ensure that young women and girls who are seeking to participate in traditional male sports such as NRL, rugby union, AFL, cricket et cetera, have somewhere where they can safely get changed for their game. That's been a great boon for so many sporting clubs out there in communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another program to increase participation focused on senior Australians. Once you get a little older, and I'm in that category, and you don't run as fast as you used to, you might give up participating in your loved sport. But then you also end up missing out on the social connection that you get from engaging in that community activity. So there was a raft of money focused on ensuring that we encourage senior Australians back into their local community clubs—whether they be soccer or netball—with modified game plans, to ensure that they're also staying physically healthy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also had a raft of measures that support the increase in participation, which I'm incredibly proud of. Our government is backing the National Sport Plan and working with state governments to find pathways for young athletes, whether they are growing up in rural and regional areas and getting to that state-level competition, or financial support to get to the national competitions which, without support, can often be a real barrier for them to pursuing their dreams.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sport plays a fundamental role in Australia's life. We have obligations under UNESCO's International Convention against Doping in Sport to abide by the principles of the World Anti-Doping Code. To that end, the Wood review recommended a range of enhancements to the capabilities of ASADA, and our government is committed to delivering on those recommendations. The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment (Enhancing Australia's Anti-Doping Capability) Bill will assist in combatting the complex and evolving nature of doping in sport. I'm very proud to be part of a government that takes these matters seriously, because sport is powerful. We want people to be participating in it safely so that we can all be rightfully proud of Australian athletes on the international stage and be comforted that the juniors who are making their way through the ranks on their way to that elite level, are equally protected from undue influence from organised crime and other negative influences. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our response will protect our cherished Australian sports for generations to come, and it will have a lasting effect on the lives of all sport-loving Australians. I'm sure that those sitting opposite share that aspiration for safe, fair, inclusive sport underpinning thriving communities. It was a pleasure to work with the opposition whilst I was the sports minister, in evolving our integrity arrangements. I know that Senator Farrell, as the shadow minister, has enjoyed equally productive conversations with the current sports minister. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will help safeguard Australian sport and combat current, emerging and future threats of doping, match fixing, illegal betting, organised crime and corruption. Parents and guardians of junior athletes will know their children are protected from sport integrity threats and they can be confident that the sports in which they participate are clean, safe and fair. I would like to think there's a lot of bipartisan goodwill around to make sure that that aspiration is achieved, and I've been very buoyed by the contributions thus far. I support the bill.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="283596" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RENNICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:44</span>):  In the last few months, I've been inundated with calls from concerned constituents as to how Australia will move forward after the coronavirus lockdown. As the saying goes, no wind blows in favour of a ship without direction. To ensure we head in the right direction, it is important to lay out a clear path that will encourage the Australian people to be innovative, productive and, most importantly, independent. To do this, governments must stand up for Australians who try to stand up for themselves and provide essential services that individuals can't provide for themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All Australians should be given access to a fair, efficient and level playing field on which to succeed. After the protests last weekend, it is evident that state governments have failed to do this, and I condemn them for their failure to enforce laws that have had a devastating impact on our small business community. Their lives and livelihoods matter too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first measure that must be addressed is monetary policy. Australia does not need foreign capital, and the cheerleaders who advocate this should actually take the time to understand what real capital is: our people and how they explored our nation's untapped wealth for themselves and their children. The father of modern Australia, Lachlan Macquarie, knew this when he introduced the holey dollar as a means to fund the building of new infrastructure. Quite simply, a country cannot protect its sovereignty or manage its economy if it doesn't control its currency or its critical infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Reserve Bank must fund an infrastructure bank that will underwrite nation-building projects. An infrastructure bank is where monetary policy meets fiscal policy, and it is the link that governments need to grow our economy. If there has been a fundamental flaw in the western government's response to the GFC, it has been in propping up inefficient companies and banks instead of building productive infrastructure like China, whose economy has grown strongly because of its commitment to nation-building infrastructure. Let's not forget: 50 years ago China was coming out of the Cultural Revolution. Yet today it has managed to pull a billion people out of poverty because its central bank, and not foreign banks, funded the development of infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent report by Goldman Sachs estimates that the G10 central banks have printed $16 trillion in the last two years. These foreign corporations, given free capital, should not be allowed to invest in Australian infrastructure or government bonds. Why? Because it's a monetary tariff that gives foreign corporations a competitive advantage over Australian companies. It's time monetary policy manipulation was called out by the World Trade Organization.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next policy that must be addressed is our taxation system. While too numerous to mention all areas of reform, I will touch on a few. The first of these is the rate of tax on above-the-line profits, such as royalties, rent and interest paid offshore. Onshore profits in Australia are taxed at much higher rates than profits sent offshore thanks to our tax treaties which have lowered the offshore tax rate to as low as zero. Australia needs to retain its own capital before increasing foreign debt. To encourage this, withholding taxes on profits sent offshore should increase to fund a cut in income tax for low-income workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of all the taxes that government levy, few cause more collateral damage than payroll tax. It is compliance heavy, with numerous exemptions, rates and thresholds across multiple states. It is like a sledgehammer to productivity. Payroll tax exists in present day Australia for one reason and one reason only: the state governments simply can't afford to give it up. But they should.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 21st century, due to advances in technology, labour has become more mobile, enabling the offshoring of Australian jobs. Reducing payroll tax would encourage Australian companies to keep work onshore and stimulate the rebirth of Australian manufacturing. If the federal government could nationalise the Corporations Act in 2001 then it should reform payroll tax, which is effectively only levied on companies. Of course, to do this will require federation reform. The fact that a federal system, conceived in the final decade of the 19th century, designed to encourage competition and productivity, delivers perverse outcomes in the 21st century suggests our federation is no longer fit for purpose. Australian business and innovation cannot compete in a global market under our current model of federation. The communist process and our dystopian bureaucracy continually undermines our individual freedoms and impedes progress at every step.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time to hold a constitutional convention to clarify the responsibilities of the states and remove the fiscal imbalance between the states and federal government. Australian people and entities should not be subject to multiple sets of rules and regulations. The ambiguous responsibilities are confusing at least and, as we saw with the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Ruby Princess, </span>tragic at worst. The overregulation of multiple governments at multiple government levels impedes our liberties, destroys innovation and suffocates inspiration. If this process doesn't mimic communism then I don't know what does.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I propose that the federal government take full responsibility for funding the entire national health system, including, most significantly, the public hospitals, with regions such as Brisbane metro north to take direct charge of operations. Currently, the federal government funds Medicare and has substantive control over aged care, the NDIS, public health insurance, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, so why not quite simply run the lot? In reality, health care is not a service with elasticity of choice and will not readily respond to competition, which could be relevant in other government service areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, education, particularly school education, is an area where competition can play a part. It is retrograde to suggest that a bureaucrat or a politician sitting in Canberra knows best on how to tailor a curriculum or support services to suit the needs of kids in Toorak, Tennant Creek or Townsville. If Australia were to adopt this suggestion in the current Frankenstein communist funding model this would deliver a net annual windfall of approximately $45 billion to state governments. This could then be used to effectively underwrite the abolition of payroll tax, which amounted to approximately $25 billion in the 2018-19 year alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The current funding model of distributing GST also needs to change. The current model is opaque and encourages inefficient states to stay that way rather than become more productive. Just as the old white building down the hill is no longer fit for purpose, and ultimately became a museum to another time, so too much of the federal architecture that defined that building has now outlived its ability to serve our Commonwealth in the 21st century.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One final but not exhaustive measure would be to make superannuation voluntarily and not compulsory. Hardworking Australians need access to their hard earned incomes today. Overpaid fund managers, super tax breaks and industry funds are an $80 billion cost to the economy this country cannot afford.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In concluding, I would like to pay tribute to all Australians and their response to the coronavirus. In particular, I would like to mention our small to medium business owners who have had to endure an enormous amount of stress and financial hardship. Our party's founder, Robert Menzies, described you as the 'backbone of this nation' and his words still ring true today. In the same way you carried the nation on its back, it is time for our political class to help you back on your feet. Without your motivation, innovation and persistence Australia cannot succeed. As Menzies said, 'Men without ambition readily become slaves.' As Australia's elected leaders it is time to capitalise on the mood for change amongst Australian people and drive the recovery from the coronavirus. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e68" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STERLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:54</span>):  My contribution will not come as a shock to you or me, but I want to bring this to the attention of the chamber. I'm going to quote from a Channel Nine news article. A truck driver by the name of Samandeep Singh was driving a truck in Melbourne. He knew his brakes were faulty but he drove on anyway before hitting and killing a Victorian police officer. I want to pay the greatest respects firstly to First Constable D'Arne De Leo, her family and loved ones. In no way do I intend to single out Mr Singh, but he was in charge of the truck at the time. He smashed into 45-year-old First Constable D'Arne De Leo's motorbike in suburban Melbourne as she was riding to work in January 2017. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the worst part. The worst part is that the report said—and I've watched the video on the internet too—that the truck wasn't roadworthy. Singh knew the rear brakes were not working and the front brakes were compromised because the vehicle was loaded incorrectly. The TV report on Channel Nine clearly said that the driver had no experience. He was a young 30-year-old man. I don't know what pain that poor fellow is going through now. Obviously, he's in a very, very difficult position. He's in jail. He's been in jail for four years. We have not only the life of a constable on her way to work being snatched but this young man's life—I don't know how he can put it back together. He has covered himself in tattoos to honour the police first constable that he, unfortunately, killed—tattoos with her police number and the date of the accident. I mean, my God, the pain that must be going through a number of families because of this accident that should never have happened. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What pains me even more, Mr Acting Deputy President Gallacher, is that you and I did a lot of work, through the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport and the road safety inquiry. A lot of the work on the road safety inquiry was channelled towards the poor condition of a lot of vehicles—heavy vehicles and trucks—on the road. Not only that, but we uncovered corruption in training—we'll call it training—where unscrupulous ratbags had lied, cheated, stolen and done whatever they could to take money and fork out very poor training and then have a connection where they could get these drivers their licences, and you know where it went from there. Three years later, Mr Acting Deputy President, as the chair of the RRAT committee, I'm still waiting for the government to come back and respond to the report that we wrote, that you and I and other senators put the work into. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go back to Mr Singh as he was coming down the road. He said: 'I started trying to brake from about a kilometre away.' I am an ex-truck driver. This was a 12-tonne truck—I never drove 12 tonnes; I drove road trains —and a kilometre away and the truck wasn't slowing down fast enough. He told a witness after the 12 January crash at Wantirna intersection. The 14-tonne Isuzu truck—sorry, I said 12; it was a 14-tonne rigid truck—was owned by Ermes Transport, and they had a record of shoddy maintenance by an unqualified mechanic. I can't believe that in 2020 I'm reading this, even though the accident happened back then. No, I can believe it, because there are no rules in this nation to go after the root cause. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The poor truck driver, when all this is said and done—I say that because of the pain he must be going through. But the family of the victim don't wish any ill towards Mr Singh, and that's a very big call. But can you believe the trucking company was not investigated. I've googled 'Ermes Transport'. I've spoken to people in Victoria. I said, 'Who the hell is Ermes Transport?' But it is typical of this nation that, when you go on the ASIC register, you can't find out who the company is. I can't find out who it is. You can't google it. There's no website for Ermes Transport. The truck was loaded. Whose freight were they carting? Were they subcontracting to another transport company? I'm not blaming that other transport company. It's just that I've got to highlight this. Were they carting directly for a client?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We lose 1,200 lives a year in road accidents and we manage to injure and maim another 30,000. A young man's life has been completely ruined. I don't know if he was forced to do it; I've got no idea. It pretty much sounds like it. But the owner of the truck has walked away scot-free. How many other trucks does this company own? How many other employees have been forced to drive trucks where they knew work had been done by 'shoddy mechanics'—they're not my words; that's the quote in the report. How many other drivers were told, 'Just get in the truck and go.' I can't believe that this trucking company, for all I know, could still be out there. They're still registered. That doesn't mean a thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sending the message out to all Australian trucking companies about Ermes Transport—whoever that is. There are sickos in this nation who get rewarded by changing their company name. I'm going to save that, because I've got a list of them and they're all going to get named in this Senate before I leave. They must be put on a do-not-use register. There is no way known that any decent man or woman in this nation would want to engage Ermes Transport, and yet the sadness is that the police could not investigate that company.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Acting Deputy President Senator Gallacher, you and I can get wound up pretty good and pretty quickly on the chain of responsibility. I am sick of that crap. The chain of responsibility—how long have we been talking about this? Thirty years? The chain of responsibility was going to be the thing that fixes everything, but what has it done? I think there have been four prosecutions. But Ermes Transport could still be running around. The man who owns Ermes Transport or the manager who directed the driver to go out there and drive the unworthy truck could be out there. The driver had a licence but hadn't been trained. He wasn't qualified. Where did the licence come from? How did that man get his licence? Who did this supposed training? Who passed him? How does this happen? Also, to the owner of Ermes Transport, how can you sleep at night? I don't even know who you are or how many of you there are, but there is a man in there doing four years of jail and a family has lost a loved one, and yet the police could not prosecute. This is just absolutely too incredible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I'm trying to get back to and what I, alongside Senator Gallacher, raise every time in this chamber and in Senate inquiries all around this nation, is the issue of road safety. We raise it all the time and say that it should absolutely be front of mind of all of us in this chamber and the other place over there. Deaths at work in trucks on the road should not be the price of doing business. Where is it in our psyche that it is wrong to crunch down on those who are doing the wrong thing when it comes to heavy vehicles or any vehicles on the road? Who in this chamber or that chamber thinks that it would not be right to go all the way down that rabbit hole and find out who the hell Ermes Transport are, where they are now, who they were carting for, if they're still carting, and where the other employees are, if there are others—I don't think for one minute there was only one truck. Who would support that? No-one. Senator Gallacher and I raise all these road safety issues around an industry that, with the greatest of respect, Senator Gallacher and I have forgotten more about heavy vehicles and road transport than anyone else, and that's not being rude—that was our background. That's where we came from. We raise the issues of how qualified our truck drivers are—I'm not even talking about wage theft or anything else yet—and how safe those vehicles are on the road. The majority of the road transport industry—not all of them—are very decent, hardworking men and women, but unfortunately we have a minority like the grubs at Ermes Transport—and I'm coming back to name more. They allow lives to be destroyed or taken away and they walk off scot-free. I can't think how annoyed the Victoria Police would be about this. And there's another incident going on where other police were killed too.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="250362" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FARUQI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:04</span>):  I rise to make a statement on Black Lives Matter and our work for justice. Over the last couple of weeks, a global antiracist movement has re-emerged to fight for racial justice and against police brutality and institutional racism. The Black Lives Matter movement has been led by black and Indigenous people and has been supported by people of colour and allies from all backgrounds. I was proud to join the huge rally at Sydney Town Hall. This protest memorialised the violent and brutal deaths of George Floyd in the United States and David Dungay Jr at Long Bay prison in Sydney, both while in custody. It called for an end to black deaths in custody. Over the long weekend, dozens of other huge rallies and gatherings were held across the country, from Wagga Wagga to Wollongong, from Alice Springs to Toowoomba.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a great deal of bluster this week about whether these rallies were appropriate during COVID-19 restrictions, but to me the choice was clear. There's no doubt that the virus is dangerous—we are all making sacrifices to stop its spread—but systemic racism is also very dangerous. It kills and contributes to many deaths in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rallies are part of a global movement. I can't help but notice that in other countries such as the United States and England, which have been hit hard by COVID-19, there are serious, long-overdue conversations about racism and discrimination happening in the wake of these protests, and there are even some institutional changes as well. In Australia, though, we're still stuck on whether the protests should have happened at all. The question we should be asking is: what has prompted tens of thousands of people to come out onto the streets demanding justice, demanding recognition from the state that black lives matter, demanding simply that First Nations people have the same right to live as others in Australia?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this week, after many days of charged protest and rallies, it was announced that Minneapolis City Council would defund its police department and invest in new models for ensuring community safety. On Sunday, the city council president pledged 'to end policing as we know it and recreate systems that actually keep us safe'. Calls for police abolition have deep, decades-old roots in antiracist movements. This idea has again come to the fore in the last few weeks and is being discussed in public. In Australia we should be having the same conversations about the viability of a so-called justice system which perpetrates violence on Indigenous people. We should not be afraid of a conversation about rethinking the very idea of policing and incarceration and looking at systems of community safety that do not inflict harm upon racial and cultural minorities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The criminal justice system is an obvious harbour for systemic racism. At least 437 Indigenous people have died in custody in Australia since the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody report was handed down in 1991, according to Guardian Australia's tracking project. This is a shocking number in itself. It's made much worse by the fact that no-one has been found criminally responsible for any of these deaths. Further reporting by <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> this week brought to light new evidence of the way the police and the criminal justice system discriminate on a daily basis. In New South Wales, over the last few years, police have chosen to pursue through the courts more than 80 per cent of Indigenous people found with small amounts of cannabis. Meanwhile, non-Indigenous people are being let off with warnings. This is a classic case of police discretion being used in a discriminatory way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't need to look too far to see discrimination of Indigenous people and other people of colour within our institutions, including in health, education and social services. It is a national shame that Aboriginal life expectancy is so far below that of other Australians, and this is a direct result of institutional racism in many ways. We must stamp out racism, discrimination, marginalisation and violence. The reality is that to do this, our police forces and the criminal justice system need to be radically overhauled. Decision-makers overseas are actively listening to the protesters. Hard conversations are happening and changes are happening. People are thinking and talking about systemic racism in a way that perhaps they never have before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what has happened here? The government is more interested in attacking me and attacking Senator Rice, other MPs and the tens of thousands of people who attended the rallies than actually talking about the substantive issue at hand. And now the Prime Minister is trying to blame the impacts of the slow return to normality on First Nations activists and their allies who are marching and fighting for black lives. Mr Morrison has said that if protesters show up to another rally they should be charged. This is not leadership; this is myopic and reactionary malice. This is a complete failure to listen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is our chance. This is our moment to talk about justice and to make the radical changes needed to upend a system that has failed First Nations people on all levels, and which has killed many. An Essential poll this week found that 80 per cent of Australians believe there is institutional racism in the United States, but only 30 per cent of the same people believe that Australian police have a racism problem. This is why people are marching: institutional racism, police brutality and systemic violence against black people is not a thing over there, it is happening right here in our own country. In fact, it's the reality that Indigenous people live with every day. It's the reality that Leetona Dungay lives with every single day of her life. Like George Floyd, her son David Dungay's last words were 'I can't breathe', just before his horrific death in custody.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This happened in Australia, not overseas. We can't proclaim how great a multicultural country we are and how we don't need to worry about racism as much as other countries while refusing to even try to understand the tens of thousands of people who showed up last weekend to support Black Lives Matter, dismissing the extensive evidence of rising and very much real racism in this country, and looking away from Aboriginal people who die in custody. This is not a great multicultural country if we can't even do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I guess, according to Liberal minister Alan Tudge, we have Asian Australians on <span style="font-style:italic;">MasterChef</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Australia</span> so we have nothing to worry about—right? Government ministers have been falling over each other to make disparaging statements against the activists who marched for Black Lives Matter, calling the protests 'self-indulgent' and 'reckless'. If there's anything that has become clear in the last two weeks, it is that the government has its head deeply buried in the sand, and wilfully so, to ignore the violence perpetrated against Indigenous people in this country. Let me tell them: you won't be able to hide for much longer! If Black Lives Matter has shown us anything, it's that there is an enormous appetite in the community for a radical change in the way our society works.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge with great humility the hard work of Black Lives Matter organisers and activists across the world, who are pushing so tirelessly for change. And I offer my heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of all those who have been killed due to racist violence. We will continue to fight for justice.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUME</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Superannuation, Financial Services and Financial Technology</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:14</span>):  'This is a time of crisis, unprecedented in the history of the nation and under conditions never before paralleled in this country.' Now, I would like to take credit for those words and that sentence but, sadly, I cannot.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know you could be forgiven for thinking that I was potentially the author, about to deliver a speech to the chamber about the health and economic implications of the coronavirus epidemic. But in fact those were the words first recorded in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> as spoken by a female voice in this chamber. It was a very different moment in time, six long decades ago, during the Second World War, when Dame Dorothy Tangney was the first woman elected to the Australian Senate and she rose to give her maiden speech. Her words, though, are eerily relevant today and particularly this week in this very strange, socially distanced sitting of the parliament. They are also more profound knowing that, tomorrow, when the Senate sits, we will in fact mark the anniversary of Australian women first earning the right to vote and to stand for federal elections.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In June 1902, the Commonwealth Franchise Act was passed. That was the law that granted most Australian women the right to vote and therefore also to stand in Commonwealth elections. In April 1902, it was Senator the Hon. Richard Edward O'Connor, who was at that stage the vice-president of the Executive Council, who introduced the Commonwealth Franchise Bill into the Senate with the intention of creating a uniform franchise for the Commonwealth. The original bill actually sought to extend the franchise not only to all women over 21 years of age but also to Indigenous Australians. The government at the time estimated that around 725,000 new voters would be added to the electoral roll as a result of this reform. That, in today's terms, is around the population of Tasmania and the Northern Territory combined. As you would imagine, the bill at that time provoked considerable debate both in the new Commonwealth parliament and also in the media and around the dinner table. It was reported in the newspapers of the day. There were plenty of opponents to women's suffrage who made various claims, including that women didn't actually want the vote and that they already exercised considerable influence through their domestic roles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill was, however, successful, although not in its original form. The act stated 'all persons not under 21 years of age, whether male or female, married or unmarried' would be entitled to vote in Commonwealth elections but, in the end, it excluded Indigenous men and women unless they were eligible to vote under state laws, in accordance with section 41 of the Australian Constitution. It would actually take another six decades until Indigenous women and men were fully included in the franchise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So across Australia women voted for the first time in the second-ever Commonwealth elections, held on 16 December 1903. Four women actually stood as candidates at that election that year. They were in fact the first women to nominate for any national parliament within what was then the British Empire. None were elected. Indeed, another 22 women followed between 1903 and the Second World War, and they too were unsuccessful. Over 40 years passed between the royal assent of the Commonwealth Franchise Act and when Dame Dorothy Tangney and Dame Enid Lyons took their seats in the Senate and the House of Representatives respectively, and 235 women have had the honour of representing their state or electorate in this place since then.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the hurdles, despite the stumbles and despite its opponents and its inadequacies, particularly when seen through a contemporary lens, the passage of the Commonwealth Franchise Act was an important moment in Australia's history which needs to be noted. This is a time for us to pause and reflect. From my own perspective, although the act passed 118 years ago, I was astounded to find that I was in fact only the 14th woman to represent Victoria when I was elected to the Senate in 2016. As with so many of my predecessors, it took four rather bruising attempts at preselection over many years before I was given that honour. I don't resent this. In fact I wear it as a badge of pride, for it is indeed a rare honour to serve. My only regret is that I didn't put my hand up sooner. I should have backed myself earlier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today there are more women serving in parliament than ever before. There are more women in cabinet than ever before. I am very proud to see so many very talented women at the helm of portfolios that play a critical role at this time, particularly throughout COVID-19—ministers like Marise Payne, Linda Reynolds, Ann Ruston, Karen Andrews and Michaelia Cash, just to name a few. These are women at the frontline of Australia's successful response, and they are supported by so many. There are also many women across the aisle on the other side of the chamber, those opposite and those on the crossbench, who I may not always agree with—in fact, I may disagree more often than not—but whom I genuinely admire for their tenacity, strength, intellect and patriotism. They are indeed all patriots. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The diversity of backgrounds of the women who have entered here is striking. From my own side of politics, we've had lawyers, accountants, small-business owners, academics, doctors, farmers, real estate agents, nurses, tourism operators, housewives, public servants and company directors. Over six decades we've seen married women with large families and single women with none, and every permutation and combination in between. They've come from the city. They've come from the country, from privilege and from poverty, from political families or, like me, those who were the first in their families to enter the political life. Backgrounds are important because they provide a unique perspective, and that is where the wisdom of crowds comes from. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, what then for the next generation? Because there is still work to be done, and I encourage women at any age and at any stage and from any background and any walk of life to consider public life. It's crazy and it's demanding, and it tests your intellect and ability. It can be very challenging, but I think every woman in this place would agree that to be part of and to contribute to something, to meaningful change, is by far the most fulfilling thing that anyone can do. I think my colleagues would also attest that, even as a rookie backbencher, you can have a very powerful voice in the party room. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I promised in my maiden speech that I would not pull the ladder up behind me and that I would reach down my hand to those who come after. It's the best way, I think, to honour not only those trailblazers who have come before but also the women who have also tried and not made it for whatever reason that may be. You often hear that women are our 'own worst enemy'. I beg to differ. In fact, I think that's a truly banal platitude largely used to foment division and suspicion amongst female colleagues. My experience could not be further from the truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need more women to put their hands up and to take the plunge. As women like Dorothy Tangney and Enid Lyons proved, good government, good policy and good politics depend on this. So tomorrow I will move a motion to acknowledge the anniversary of the Commonwealth Franchise Act and it will be co-signed by all my female colleagues in the coalition. I will ask any senator here, whether they be male or female, if they would like to also co-sign it, but I would particularly like my female colleagues from the opposition and the crossbench to join me in this. </span>

As all parliamentarians, regardless of gender, enter their respective chambers tomorrow, I hope that they will acknowledge this particular anniversary, this particular milestone. Earlier nearly than every other country in the world did we reach 118 years where women could not only vote but enter parliament. I hope that, as they enter the chamber, whether they be male or female, they are genuinely proud of the achievements of women from all sides of politics, all sides of the chamber, all parts of our history, all parts of today and all parts of the future for they have been so important in shaping our nation in the past, today and in the years ahead.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:23</span>):  I'm very mindful in this time in making my first substantive contribution about matters topical that's provided in this forum to acknowledge the COVID crisis and how that's changed how business has been operating here in the parliament and how people want consensus and not division. But I want to assure the Australian people, hundreds of thousands of them, who received a robodebt, that I will not be silent on their plight: robodebt is an egregious breach of trust between the Australian people and this government, and it is an unforgiveable act by an Australian government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government want to sweep the issue under the rug for a while, and the issue is that they unlawfully established debts that they sent out to the people of Australia. At the very end of Friday, 29 May, Minister Stuart Robert announced an end to this program of taking money from Australians raised by debts that were the result of averaging by the ATO. He finally came out, after denying and hiding and denying and hiding for many, many months the fact that he'd sent hundreds of thousands of Australians erroneous debts, and admitted it. But there was no apology, there was no admission of guilt and there was no acknowledgement that what this Liberal-Nationals government that has been governing this country for seven years had done was wrong—no grief, no apology, no sorrow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make clear who should bear the blame for the design and the implementation of this unlawful attack on the Australian people by its own government. There are three key players: Mr Morrison, Mr Porter and Mr Stuart Robert. It is indeed the Prime Minister—who was the Treasurer, scraping for dollars in his budget management—who, absolutely without care for the people he was targeting, in 2016 announced the robodebt scheme. There have been iterations of it since, but the architect who made the announcement—the man who went after Australians' money illegally—was Mr Morrison; he started it all off. If you've got a robodebt—and there are hundreds of thousands of Australians out there—please remember: it's Mr Morrison who set that system up and sent you that debt notice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And the Attorney-General, Mr Christian Porter, was absolutely intimately involved in the design of the scheme. He is now the first law officer of the land—the Attorney-General for Australia. He should have been seeking, at the time, legal advice about what they were proposing to do to change the way in which they were to account for Australians receiving short-term support, and they changed it in such a way that did not allow for any human oversight. The current minister, Stuart Robert, has shown all the promotional qualities that the government relies on. He has been able to deflect blame. He has been able to deny responsibility. In fact, he became a master of it with regard to the failure of the Centrelink computer system. At least he said sorry for that, in a sort of perverse way, when he agreed it was 'his bad'—'My bad', he said—when he attributed the failure of the Centrelink system to a cyberattack, when in fact the failure was a failure of himself, as the minister, and his own department to prepare for the scale of need amongst Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that's what you get from these three men, Mr Morrison, Mr Porter and Mr Stuart Robert: a set of choices characterised by arrogance and greed. This government could have pursued multinational tax avoiders. They could have pursued those who had capacity to pay. But instead they made a choice and announced in 2016 that they would hound and kick down the doors of the most vulnerable in our community, and they unleashed debt notices for thousands and thousands of dollars, with private debt collectors chasing them up, driving people into despair and in some cases driving them to a point where they could no longer bear the burden of the attacks from their own government. In the very sad case of Rhys Cauzzo that was reported over the weekend, his mother had these words to say about the government:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">They need to apologise. Not just for the likes of myself - and obviously many more families in that situation - but for people that have had to put their life on hold to try and scrape back thousands of dollars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It wasn't right and they knew that in the beginning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Apologise so that we can move forward, but don't think you are going to get out of anything.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the voice of a mother who buried her son because he could no longer withstand the hounding of this government, who sent him an illegal debt notice—a government that knew this in September, a government that denied it, a government that refused to answer questions at Senate estimates and in hearings of the Community Affairs References Committee. This government is in denial about what they have done to this country, and it is a great shame. It is a telling indictment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, where are we now? According to evidence on the public record, we've got more than 470,000 unlawful debt notices from the government, who supposedly are going to receive $¾ billion in repayments. But that's not going to happen straightaway, even though the government knew this was going on. They're delaying the return of that money, which should never have been taken from Australians, until July. Here we are in the worst economic crisis that living Australians have experienced and the government, who took money unlawfully from those Australian citizens, refuse to return it in a timely way, having denied and denied and denied that they were doing the wrong thing. For years they denied it under questioning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The things that concern me are that the numbers that the government throws around are so bad and their practices with regard to robodebt so unconscionable that I'm not even sure that that's the correct number. Is it 470,000 or is it 740,000? This is the government that lost $60 billion just a couple of weeks ago. They're not really good at the numbers. What they're good at is creating false debts, hounding and pursuing Australian citizens literally to their death or demise. This is a stain on the nation, led off by Mr Morrison and Mr Porter and backed in at every opportunity by Minister Stuart Robert.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the government has only come to this point of public acknowledgement of failure because the matter is to be debated in the Supreme Court. In some perverted effort to try to contain any further information coming to public light, this government is attempting keep their ministers out of the witness box. The robodebt scheme always was and is to this day indefensible. It cannot stand up to legal scrutiny. The government have sought in estimates hearings to use public interest immunity, to say it is against the interest of the Australian people, for them to tell the truth. They hid behind that. The level of obfuscation that's going on is just a disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Attorney-General, Christian Porter, says that robodebt was legally insufficient, but it wasn't legally insufficient for him when he was the Minister for Social Services and used that scheme to hound Australians into poverty. How can you be the nation's top legal officer when you are actually an architect of an unlawful scheme that allowed theft to run under your nose for years and years? In some perverse use of language, the three efforts that this government made to change some of the most egregious parts of the robodebt scheme they simply called 'refinements'—refinements! All they were doing was creating sharper tools to torture the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As hundreds of thousands of Australians were forced to seek jobseeker during this unprecedented economic crisis, they did so in good faith that the government was there to support them. The last thing they want as they struggle to get back into the job market and struggle to keep their lives together is to be further harassed and victimised over bogus debts. The scheme was unlawful, it remains unlawful now and news on 2 June that the government intends to consider bringing in legislation to re-establish the veracity of their disgraceful robodebt program is an absolute embarrassment. Australians need support from this government, not the continuation of the practices that the government have so egregiously inflicted on the nation through the robodebt scheme.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="76760" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GRIFF</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  I rise today to speak about the potential closure of Springbank Secondary College, a unique school located in the federal seat of Boothby in South Australia. A review commissioned by South Australian Minister for Education John Gardner into the future of the school is currently underway. News of the review has most significantly distressed the students and their parents and caregivers. This is because so many people involved with the school value its strong commitment to providing a fully inclusive and positive school environment for the 37 students in the disability unit and the many more students on the autism spectrum in the broader mainstream student cohort.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The review goes against commitments the minister made just a year ago to invest $10 million in the school. It would be very disappointing if the economic needs of the state are prioritised over the educational and social benefits that Springbank Secondary College provides to its unique and much-loved cohort of students. The best needs of children must always be the paramount consideration. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having such a unique cohort of students within the broader mainstream cohort is invaluable. It allows for all students to have a greater understanding of compassion, empathy, diversity and inclusivity. To seek to end this cohesion would be cruel in the extreme. There are currently around 167 students enrolled in this school, up from 144 last year, and prior to the announcement of the potential closure it was projected to have 200 students in 2021. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrary to media reports and statements made by the minister, the school population is actually growing. It is attracting students from outside its zone because what it uniquely offers is not normally available at larger campuses, such as Unley High School, which is already well and truly oversubscribed. One of my constituents has a son who was rejected by Unley High School last year. The deputy principal told the family, 'We can't educate your son and we are extremely embarrassed.' Fancy hearing that! Would any of us like to hear that from the deputy principal of a school? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The family was then referred to Springbank Secondary College and were told that the college could cater for their son. Their son was subsequently enrolled there and is now thriving in a welcoming, inclusive and specialist environment which understands that children with a disability and children on the autism spectrum are well and truly worth being educated. Springbank Secondary College invests the time and effort in giving all children with disabilities fair and equal treatment, like their peers. If these children are forced to enrol in schools that don't want them and in much-larger, less-welcoming schools they will fall through the cracks. We cannot let this happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent shocking death of South Australian Ann Marie Smith shows only too tragically what can take place when people with a disability are seen as a number, forgotten and neglected by the system that is meant to care for them. Ann Marie's death has left us all deeply shocked and reeling. She died on 6 April from severe septic shock, multiple organ failure, severe pressure sores, malnutrition and issues connected with her cerebral palsy. To be clear: it was not her disability that killed her. Her manner of death was entirely preventable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shockingly, Ann Marie died after being deposited in a woven cane chair in her living room for 24 hours a day for over a year. The cane chair operated as both her toilet and her bed. Ann Marie's last year was a life confined to that cane chair surrounded by filth. She was malnourished and suffering from horrific pressure sores. Absolutely no-one should ever have to endure such pain, suffering and isolation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a South Australian and as a father I'm appalled by what happened to Ann Marie. It brought home that fear that grips many parents who have adult children living with a disability—the fear of what will happen to their child when they die. Who will love and care for them? Who will advocate and protect them? My heart goes out to these parents whose fears have now intensified after learning the sickening details surrounding Ann Marie's tragic death. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Smith had loving parents, who made provisions for her. She was diagnosed with severe cerebral palsy and needed significant assistance for toileting and hygiene. They had cared for her all of their lives. She lived in a house that had been set up to enable her to be well looked after long after her parents' death. That house ultimately became her prison. She had not been seen outside for many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She lived alone at her Kensington Park home in Adelaide's eastern suburbs and had to rely on a carer for all her needs following her parents' death. That carer was employed by the ironically named Integrity Care (SA), who subsequently confirmed the termination of employment of Ms Smith's carer five weeks after her death.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The directors of Integrity Care must also be held to account. After Ms Smith died in the Royal Adelaide Hospital, a complaint was made to the Health and Community Services Complaints Commissioner about her care by the doctors who treated her. Ms Smith's death has been declared a major crime, with the South Australian police investigating how she was unable to move from the cane chair for more than a year and had no access to a toilet or fridge containing food. No doubt the police will uncover more despicable facts as the investigation unfolds. Further, it was revealed that the South Australian Minister for Human Services, Michelle Lensink, became aware of Ms Smith's death only after SAPOL called for information from the South Australian public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her shocking and preventable death has highlighted significant and stark gaps in the NDIS system with respect to the oversight and safeguarding of people living with profound disability. It is unfathomable to me that there was no line of sight by state or federal agencies over the care of Ms Smith, when there should have been. They have failed in their duty of care to Anne Marie. She was receiving services which were funded and regulated by the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, and these failings must be investigated independently. So many questions remain which must be addressed. How does this happen under our watch? How do these things happen under the National Disability Insurance Scheme? The NDIS is set up so that we have multiple levels of support and multiple levels of checking. Where was the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission? Where were they, indeed?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister, Stuart Robert, has said that checks were done in Anne Marie's case, but he refuses to provide any detail by hiding behind an investigation. Clearly, there have been many failures in her care at a state and federal level. People like Anne Marie should not have just one person coming to their house. They should not be kept inside a house in a cane chair for years. They should not be denied a fridge, denied love, denied care, denied respect and denied dignity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The South Australia coroner will conduct an inquest into Ms Smith's death following the SAPOL investigation. Other investigations into her death have been announced by the South Australian government, including a task force that will report in only a matter of weeks. I wrote to the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability, requesting that it conduct its own investigation into the death of Ms Smith. This is very important given the commission's statutory independence from government and the fact that it has been specifically tasked with examining the very issues at the heart of her untimely and preventable death—particularly the protection of people with disability against experiencing violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I close, I want to publicly honour Anne Marie's life today. Every individual, every human, has intrinsic value, and when we fail to care for the weakest and most vulnerable amongst us it diminishes us all.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="263418" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Forestry and Fisheries and Assistant Minister for Regional Tourism</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  Before I start, I want to acknowledge the heartfelt words from Senator Griff on a matter which is very distressing. When I heard the news of Ms Smith's death I must say that I was particularly moved about the situation and the circumstances. I commend him for raising it in those terms here in this chamber. Thank you, Senator Griff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I want to talk about Tasmania—something I'm very passionate about, representing it in this place. And I know that all of you would like to represent Tasmania, because it is the best part of our federation! And I know that Senator Green would agree with me on that. But I am particularly proud of Tasmanians for how they've conducted themselves throughout this health crisis which our country and our world have grappled with. Tasmanians, like everyone else in the country and everyone else in the world, have had to deal with the restrictions that come with trying to manage and suppress this virus so that we can get ready to deal with living with it, as we build up capacity for hospital admissions related to COVID and respiratory illnesses, boost our testing capacity and develop the app to trace contacts of those with confirmed infections.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout this whole time, with all of the sacrifices made by households, businesses and communities, Tasmanians have conducted themselves in an honourable way. They have abided by the rules and we can see the downward trend in the number of infections in Tasmania, as we can in most other jurisdictions. The infection rate is plummeting, and I think all state and territory jurisdictions have done a commendable job in managing the restrictions and the health implications. But, while I commend Tasmanians for what they have done, that's not to say that it has been easy for them, particularly in small business. Businesses in the tourism and hospitality space that were thriving one day with full dining rooms and accommodation full to the brim, particularly in our peak season, were completely empty the next. As we know, restrictions were very, very tough, and they were brought into effect immediately.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As restrictions started to ease, one thing I was pleased to see—and it's probably the same right across the country—was Tasmanians helping one another out, particularly when it came to supporting Tasmanian small businesses, which was something that I took to doing. My small contribution in trying to help Tasmanian businesses was to give shout-outs to small-to-medium enterprises that needed the business. As restrictions started to ease, as cafes and restaurants could begin to trade again and as certain retail establishments were able to reopen, I thought it was a good opportunity to give a shout-out to some of these small businesses that employ a great many Tasmanians, particularly in regional communities where these jobs are needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I refer to businesses like the Rustic Bakehouse in the beautiful town of Cressy; Greenhill Nursery in Leslie Vale, which is a terrific establishment run by David Drysdale; Skippers in St Helens, which does a great job and a very good lunch; Whimsy Florist in Hobart; Frog's Bakery in Deloraine; and Not Just Books in Burnie. These are just a few of the businesses I have shouted out to. All of them are great contributors to their local economy and great employers who employ a great many Tasmanians. I commend them for what they're doing. I know they've done the best they can in the circumstances they face. I know that most of these businesses are very grateful for the support they've received throughout this time until they could open their doors again, including the cash stimulus packages, where applicable, and the JobKeeper support to keep their employees on the books and connected with the workplace. I commend all of the proprietors of these businesses, as well as the people who work in those businesses, for what they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of those businesses, of course, are our zoos and wildlife sanctuaries. In Tasmania, we have quite a few of these establishments. Like any other tourism or hospitality business, they struggled with the fact that they had to shut their doors immediately. And just because they shut their doors and had zero dollars coming through the gates it didn't mean that the costs stopped. That is why I was pleased to join with Greg Irons from Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary just outside Hobart to announce the $94½ million package to support our zoos, aquariums and wildlife sanctuaries and enable them to meet some of the fixed costs associated with running these very expensive entities. In Tasmania, we have around 160,000 visitors to our zoos and wildlife sanctuaries each year, so they are a significant contributor to our visitor economy. They are one of the premium tourism attractions in our state. As I said, there are eight: Bonorong Wildlife Century just outside of Hobart; East Coast Natureworld; Devils@Cradle; Tasmania Zoo; Tasmanian Devil Unzoo; Trowunna Wildlife Sanctuary; Wing's Wildlife Park; and, of course, Zoodoo Zoo also in the south. All of these businesses do a great job, not just because they showcase something so special about Tasmania in terms of our native wildlife but also because they provide local employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I went to the Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary, had a tour and made this announcement with Greg Irons, he was able to tell me that, from the money that they earn from their admissions, they run the animal care hospital on site. They run that completely from the proceeds of the visitors to their wildlife sanctuary. There are no handouts and no grants. It is purely funded by them and, of course, by donations from the public, who do care and want to ensure that our wildlife is looked after. So I commend Greg and his crew at Bonorong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was great to go to Tasmania Zoo with our candidate for Rosevears—the upper house election in Tasmania is coming up soon—to talk to the crew there about how much it costs to feed their lions and their tigers. They were truly thankful for the support that's being provided. It means that, when we do get through this properly and our borders are open and our restrictions are gone, they will be able to continue to operate and provide the tourism offering that they have so proudly provided for so long.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to briefly mention Rural Youth Tasmania, the group behind our flagship rural event in Tasmania, Agfest, which is held annually in May. Sadly, this year, because of coronavirus and the restrictions that have been put in place, they were unable to hold Agfest, which is a huge drawcard for tens of thousands of people. They congregate in a place called Quercus Rural Youth Park just outside of Launceston in northern Tasmania in the electorate of Lyons. There are farming businesses and producers of fine food and wine; all sorts of goods are on offer at this show. They weren't able to hold it this year, but that didn't mean that they didn't do anything.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rural Youth took it online. From the paddock to the cloud, they were able to hold Agfest on the internet, in effect. Over the period of time that the 400 exhibitors who were part of this initiative were exhibiting the thousands of products, deals and services that were available, we were able to see that more than one million page visits occurred. There were more than one million views of Agfest online.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had people from the US, New Zealand, the UK, Germany, India, Japan and the Philippines all paying particular attention to Agfest online and all wanting to get their hands on something uniquely Tasmanian and special about our state. It was great that Tasmanians, who never let circumstance stop them or got them down, were able to take advantage of this situation to continue to trade so that they could continue to employ their workers and pay the bills and so will be participants in the economy when we get through this crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I commend Rural Youth Tasmania for their initiative. I think it's fantastic that they were able to do it. I hope we never see a repeat, but, certainly, it shows that young people in our primary industries are ingenious when it comes to finding ways to get around the problems that they face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I'd like to talk about the government's commitment to our high-end producers of primary produce. In Tasmanian, we have our seafood industry. Tasmania employs more people in the seafood industry than does any other state or territory in the Commonwealth. We were able to support this industry through our freight support mechanism, the $110 million dollar program that was able to get our wonderful premium seafood and other horticultural products like lamb, abalone, beef, berries and the like to our international markets even though the flights had stopped flying. Just because the flights had stopped, it didn't mean that the demand had. Once China, Japan, the Middle East and the US were ready to reopen and, of course, purchase our products, we were ready to go with our support mechanism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first flight that took off was full of Tasmanian salmon. The salmon industry employs 5,000 Tasmanians, something I'm very proud of, and I was proud to support this and other industries through this mechanism. I commend the participants in the seafood industry, and, as I say, I'm very proud of my fellow Tasmanians for all they've done.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  We know that some of the biggest decisions that will determine the long-term economic recovery of the Cairns region and other tourism towns in regional Queensland will be the decisions of this government. This government will need to make a decision about whether they taper and target JobKeeper to support heavily impacted tourism regions, and we know that Cairns is the hardest hit area in Queensland. They are pleading for certainty on JobKeeper today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government will also need to make a decision about whether to provide support to our aviation sector, because we know that without a second national airline—without Virgin flying to the regions directly from our cities—our tourism industry will not recover in the long term.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator GREEN:</span>
                  </a>  The Prime Minister is now insisting on snapping away support and taking away JobKeeper when we know that the economy won't snap back. When the travel ban on Chinese travel was put in place by this federal government in February, I said that the crisis would hit Cairns first and worst, and I was right. In December we saw the first signs of the outbreak in China, and on 1 February the federal government banned international travel from China. This ban had an immediate and significant impact on the Cairns region, which was expecting Chinese New Year travellers that week. I called for direct support for the tourism industry in this place, and in Cairns I called on the Prime Minister to visit Cairns and see the impact firsthand and deliver support. The Prime Minister was asked in a press conference if he was considering financial assistance to the university, tourism or hospitality sectors and in February he said no. There were warning signs and cancellations and yet no support from this government. When assistance finally did come, it came in the form of marketing money redirected from a $76 million crisis package already announced for areas struggling in the wake of the bushfires. They redirected bushfire money, and that was all they could come up with to support the tourism industry back in February.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Assistance in the form of JobKeeper to those businesses that have been impacted finally came when the government adopted Labor's proposal for a wage subsidy scheme. But we know that those payments didn't start hitting the ground until the first week in May. February, March, April, May: that is how long it took this government to do anything to help the tourism industry. And we know that this government has failed to act to stop our second national airline going into administration. In extraordinary and unprecedented times, the government failed to step up to the plate and is still refusing to work with an administrator to help Virgin survive and bring tourists to regional Queensland. They have sat on their hands as regional economies have pleaded for them to step in and help Virgin. All they've done is deliver stopgap measures. Regional economies need a long-term plan and certainty for the industry now, but they can't get that from this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Treasury figures released today confirm what we already know—that the Cairns economy is not going to snap back to normal on 27 September. The data shows that Cairns will be one of the hardest-hit areas in Queensland if wage subsidies end on 27 September. There are 500 more businesses registered in Cairns than there are in Brisbane, and Scott Morrison's comments this week that JobKeeper would run until the end of September as legislated and no more show that this government has no plan to keep regional economies afloat. Cairns Regional Council and Far North Queensland tourist operators have called on the federal government—that's you guys—to provide certainty, but there are no signs that the government will act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, the less done to protect jobs and support vulnerable workers, businesses and communities in the coming months, the harder and longer the economic recovery will be. It's clear to tourism operators and businesses in Cairns that the economy has been hit hard. It is not unreasonable for the government to take circumstances like this into consideration and give those businesses some certainty about JobKeeper. So, maybe instead of coming in here with their daggers sharpened to the state government, instead of drafting motions about what other governments should do, those opposite might want to consider doing their job and doing what is within the realm of their own responsibility and their own accountability as members of this government. Give businesses and employers some certainty around JobKeeper. Do that! It is your job. Save our second national airline from collapse to protect regional tourism. Step up to the plate and do something to save Virgin.</span>

Yesterday the minister refused to accept that it was wrong to hound Nadia Sievewright over an illegal robodebt when she was eight months pregnant. Kath Madgwick's son Jarrad was issued a robodebt under Mr Morrison's illegal scheme. Jarrad tragically took his life after reading the letter from Centrelink about his robodebt, and Ms Madgwick believes the letter 'tipped him over the edge'. Does the Prime Minister now accept it was wrong to hound vulnerable Australians like Jarrad as a result of the illegal robodebt scheme he designed and implemented?</span>

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has released a very important report overnight which shows the devastating effects that COVID-19 and the COVID-19 pandemic are having on the world economy. Importantly, what the OECD report shows is that Australia is leading the developed world in its economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. The OECD expects economic growth in Australia to rebound, despite the global economy facing, 'the deepest recession since the Great Depression', with the loss of income exceeding 'any previous recession over the last 100 years outside wartime, with dire and long-lasting consequences for people, firms and governments'. The OECD is forecasting global growth to fall by at least six per cent in 2020, and that is in the absence of a second wave of infections. To put this in context, global growth fell by just 0.1 per cent in 2009 during the so-called global financial crisis and is now forecast to fall by at least six per cent, as long as we can avoid a second wave of infections.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the OECD, the outlook for Australia is the third best among all OECD members. The OECD forecast for Australia is for GDP to contract by five per cent in 2020 before bouncing back to 4.1 per cent growth in 2021. Australia's economic outlook for 2020 compares remarkably well with other countries. The United Kingdom is forecast to contract by 11.5 per cent, France by 11.4 per cent, Italy by 11.3 per cent, New Zealand by 8.9 per cent, Canada by eight per cent and the United States by 7.3 per cent.

The OECD report makes it very clear that the economic consequences of a second wave of infections would be 'dire' for both the Australian and the world economies. In the event of a second wave the report said: 'The global economy would likely contract by a further 1.6 per cent. The Australian economy would contract by a further 1.3 per cent.' That means our economic contraction would jump from five per cent to 6.3 per cent under the second-wave scenario, which would be an extra $25 billion blow to our economy. But it wouldn't stop there. A second wave would also hit our forecast recovery in 2020-21 by 3.1 per cent, which would mean an $80 billion blow to our economy over two years. That would cost thousands of Australian jobs. That is why every Australian has a patriotic duty to do everything they can to help minimise the risk of a second wave. That is why every Australian must heed the health advice and must not attend mass protests at this time.</span>

The OECD has praised Australia for acting quickly to close our borders and put in place the necessary health restrictions which helped us to successfully flatten the curve. The OECD has praised Australia for its massive macroeconomic support. That economic support was only possible because we entered this crisis from a position of economic and fiscal strength. Growth was increasing at the end of last year. Unemployment was falling in February. We had returned the budget to balance for the first time in 11 years. Because of that strength, we have been able to provide support of $260 billion, or 13.3 per cent of GDP, in support of workers, households and business. There's still a long way to go in recovering from this once-in-100-years global pandemic, but we're heading in the right direction. It is important that we remain vigilant and that all Australians do everything they can to avoid a second wave of infection.</span>

I draw the senator to my answer to the previous question in relation to any comments that I intend to make or, for that matter, not make in relation to this particular matter. However, what I would say, following my response to the primary part of your question, is that last November we did make changes in relation to this particular program on the back of the decision by the government at that time that we would cease or pause the recovery of debts in relation to the income compliance program. But I think the most important thing that's worth the chamber understanding is that in my time as the social services minister, and also during the time that Minister Fletcher was the minister for social services, we've also embarked on some significant reforms in the social services area in relation to Single Touch Payroll and also for the change of assessment model— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Using technologies such as Single Touch Payroll and the change of assessment model—which, sadly, won't be able to come into play on 1 July, but hopefully we'll get it in in August—helps make sure that Australians who are reporting income are reporting their income accurately because we give them the tools to do so. By simplifying the model by which people are able to report income, we hope to be able to reduce the amount that people are incurring in debts.</span>

Over the last few months Australians have worked together to suppress COVID-19, giving us time to prepare our health system to live with the virus. As a country, we have used this time well, sourcing additional ventilators and personal protective equipment and making plans for our hospitals to respond to a surge in cases. We have, as you know, expanded our testing regime, developed our capability to respond quickly to new cases and outbreaks, and improved our ability to quickly identify people who may have been exposed to the virus. </span>

Yesterday there were only seven new cases reported across the whole of Australia—four new cases in Victoria and three new cases in New South Wales. </span>

While Australians can, of course, see that road back, it does not mean that we must not remain vigilant—we need to, in particular, be observing social-distancing practices. </span>

The OECD does expect Australia to rebound, despite the global economy facing the deepest recession since the Great Depression. The OECD's outlook for Australia is the third best amongst all 36 OECD nations, but a second wave of COVID-19 infections would wipe out four years of economic growth in Australia and expose highly indebted mortgage holders to possible mass defaults.</span>

It is critical that all of us, every single one of us, continues to ensure we do not put the lives of others at risk, the livelihoods of our families and our friends at risk and, most importantly, the most vulnerable Australians at risk. We all need to ensure that we exercise an abundance of caution and follow the medical advice on the additional and practical steps that we all need to take, including: staying 1.5 metres away from other people whenever and wherever possible; maintaining good handwashing and coughing and sneezing hygiene; staying at home if we're unwell; and getting tested if we have respiratory symptoms or a fever. We've shown what we can achieve together. Let's not throw it away. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

New South Wales and the Northern Territory have become the first jurisdictions to restart pokies. Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced gaming venues could possibly be allowed to open as part of step 3 by July. Australians have saved $3 billion since the pokies have been shut, with many gamblers forced to go cold turkey with their pokies addictions. The money saved has been spent in other areas of the economy rather than being lost down poker machines. Advocates against gambling are concerned about significant health risks of restarting the pokies during such a vulnerable time. Does the government share these concerns that a resumption of pokies will lead to a rise in gambling related health and risks social harm?</span>

We are certainly aware of the recent reports that people might be going back to their pre-COVID gambling habits, despite the social-distancing requirements that exist within gambling venues. We're also aware of reports from analytics consultancy AlphaBeta Advisors and the credit firm illion on changes to people's gambling habits during the first few months of the coronavirus pandemic. It is for this very reason—the protection of Australians from gambling—that the Australian government embarked on a program of reform within the gambling sector to put in place the National Consumer Protection Framework for Online Wagering. It's very much the centrepiece of Australia's gambling reforms, because we want to help make sure that consumers are protected no matter where they are in Australia. It also provides a framework that empowers Australians through the use of tools to make sure they control their own behaviours with their online gambling habits. We take very, very seriously making sure Australians have the tools to protect themselves. But what I would say, Senator Griff, is that state and territory governments have the primary responsibility for licensing and regulating the land-based gambling establishments to which you are largely referring in your primary question. Obviously as the federal government, and through many of our agreements and the relationships that we continue to have and which have probably been enhanced over recent times in our discussions with our state and territory counterparts, we are working together to make sure that, through this unprecedented time that we find ourselves in at the moment, we put in place protections to make sure we can assist Australians to get to the other side of this pandemic.</span>

Of course, the government takes all the motions passed in this place very seriously. But two things have been very important in the delivery of your request and desire to make sure that greater assistance is put in place for people who find themselves with a gambling addiction. One has been the recognition by this government, through the COVID-19 pandemic, of the greater need for the assistance, support and financial resourcing of our mental health services, to make sure that those people who find themselves in a position where their mental health is in turn being impacted by how the coronavirus pandemic has impacted them have the resources and the support that they need.</span>

Our government has made responsible decisions right from the outset of this crisis. We have made decisions to save lives and to save livelihoods, and we will continue to make those decisions; we will continue to make responsible decisions moving forward. The Senate would be well aware of the Treasury review that has been well and truly publicly canvassed. Once the findings and recommendations of that review are received, the government will be making further responsible decisions. I can reassure the people of North Queensland that our government is very, very focused on their best interests. Of course, the most important thing the people of North Queensland would like to see right now is the removal of the state border restrictions so that the planes can start flying again and so that tourists can go to North Queensland again. If you were interested in the best interests of the people of North Queensland, you would be calling on Premier Palaszczuk to remove the state border restrictions.</span>

That is on the back of our national economic plan for stronger growth and because of the leadership provided by a number of distinguished and outstanding senior cabinet ministers, including the minister for women's interests, Senator Payne, and her predecessors who have done outstanding work in promoting the cause of women's economic interests in the context of our government.</span>

South-East Asian nations like Taiwan quickly learned with regard to COVID that they just had to isolate the sick and the vulnerable and that allowed healthy and productive people in businesses to keep working and earning money. The result is that the economy in Taiwan and other South-East Asian nations remained healthy and they had far fewer deaths than Australia. Minister, was there any consideration given in April to changing Australia's COVID strategy when Taiwan and other South-East Asian nations had already proved that their strategy worked and was far superior to your government's strategy?</span>

In making decisions and in making judgements we were guided by the advice of relevant experts. In relation to how best to deal with the health threat, we were guided principally by the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, the Chief Medical Officer and chief health officers from around Australia and the Commonwealth. I think it is fair to say, and for a range of reasons, the early decision to impose border restrictions—in terms of non-residents who had spent any time over the previous 14 days in mainland China not being able to come to Australia, and imposing quarantine requirements on Australian permanent residents having spent time over the previous 14 days in mainland China—has demonstrably helped delay the spread of the virus. This gave us time to prepare, not only in terms of the hospital capacity to deal with the potential inflow of patients but also the risk management processes that would best equip us to save lives by slowing down and suppressing the spread of the virus and helping to put the economic support measures in place.</span>

That's why we put in place the economic support package that we have in order to keep as many businesses in business through the transition as possible, to keep as many working Australians connected to their employer during this transition as possible and to provide enhanced support to those Australians who, through no fault of their own, lost their jobs because of the coronavirus crisis.</span>

                  </a>  They don't understand the English language, seemingly. I made this point over 3½ hours at the Senate COVID committee the other day and I made the point yesterday. I've said it in the media on I don't know how many occasions. Yes, the JobKeeper program is legislated. That's a statement of fact. The JobKeeper program is legislated for six months. We've also said that there was a review which was always scheduled to take place about halfway through the operation of the JobKeeper program. I can't pre-empt what the findings of that review will be. I have not yet seen them. I can't pre-empt what the recommendations may or may not be—indeed, whether there are any recommendations at all. But what I can tell you is that the JobKeeper program is legislated and will be in place for the six months, which we've all said. That statement that I made about adjustments that may be made is not inconsistent with the statement that the JobKeeper program will be in place for six months, which it will.</span>

We're not considering any proposal. We're not expecting any proposal to end the JobKeeper program for any other sector. In relation to child care, it was a specific proposal that was initiated by the sector itself because there was a better, fairer, more equitable way to provide transitional support to that industry given that activity levels across childcare centres had significantly increased again. The reason JobKeeper was put in place for the childcare sector was that, in the context of a drop in activity levels, the childcare subsidy was no longer generating revenue. With activity levels going back up, there is, of course, now a capacity to generate government revenue through childcare subsidies as well as parental contributions as well as a transitional payment of $708 million by the government. So what we're doing here is entirely appropriate. You're argument is that we should keep childcare free forever. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Morrison government is delivering on our commitment to deepen Australia's relationships with key partners in the Indo-Pacific. India is, of course, the world's most populous democracy and a rising economic and strategic power in our region. Last week Prime Ministers Morrison and Modi, held a virtual summit—India's first. It was a landmark moment in the ties between our nations. Australia and India agreed, and announced, that we will elevate our relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership underpinned by democratic principles, the shared promotion of the rules-based international order and the preservation of an open and inclusive Indo-Pacific. In a time of great global challenges, it's more important than ever that countries such as Australia and India come together to reinforce our common values. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A new joint declaration on maritime cooperation signals the commitment of Australia and India to a rules-based maritime order in the Indo-Pacific, which is founded on respect for the sovereignty of all nations and international law, particularly the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The partnership will strengthen maritime domain awareness and increase cooperation on major transnational challenges, such as people smuggling, arms and narcotics trafficking, climate change, terrorism, and illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our partnership is grounded in strong people-to-people links and the invaluable contribution of Indian migrants to modern Australia.

It takes our relationship to a new level of practical cooperation, reflecting both the depth and the breadth of our mutual interests. In addition to the CSP text itself, we've signed eight substantive agreements that will strengthen technical cooperation and create new opportunities for Australian businesses. We'll work more closely than ever with India to build our ties in mining and critical minerals, in vocational education, training, water resources, public administration, science and technology and defence. The Defence Minister, Minister Reynolds, and I are very pleased that we've also agreed to foreign and defence minister two- plus-two meetings at least every two years. Australia is just the third country to join such meetings with India, along with Japan and the United States.</span>

A new Australia-India Cyber and Critical Technology Partnership will create a research and development fund for our businesses and researchers and support other countries to improve their cyber-resilience. Australia and India have a shared vision for an open, free, rules based and secure internet. Importantly, this will also ensure that cyber and technological cooperation will sit at the core of our new comprehensive strategic partnership as we forge a dynamic Australia-India 21st century relationship.</span>

I am going to have to take on notice the specific question that he has asked me because I do not have the necessary information in relation to the three per cent number that he is quoting. However, while I have the opportunity to add something in relation to the government's response to the bushfire affected communities in Australia, we recognise that it has been a very, very traumatic time for those people that have been affected by bushfires because, on top of that, they have had to endure the coronavirus pandemic impacts that all Australians and all Australian communities have had to endure as well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to assure all bushfire affected communities that they have not been forgotten. I acknowledge that the recovery in many areas has been hampered by the COVID pandemic, but the government is focused on addressing bushfire relief and recovery needs with flexibility and speed, and that is why the Prime Minister himself announced, on 11 May this year, a further $650 million in assistance in addition to the $2 billion bushfire recovery fund, which, I might say, has already been fully committed. A billion dollars of this fund has already been delivered and is working to support the locally led effort in response to the bushfire impacts on the ground in these communities, including in my home state of South Australia, particularly in the Adelaide Hills and the Kangaroo Island area that were devastated by the two fires that took hold in South Australia over the Christmas and new year period. When you add that to the expenditure from existing measures, this means that around $1.4 billion is rolling out across our bushfire affected communities and supporting individuals within those communities.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:47</span>):  Stephanie Stanhope lost her home in the Bega Valley on 4 January June 2020. Struggling to navigate the system, she said: 'For all the assistance you are led to believe was going to be there, it isn't. Not long after it happened, there was a call from someone in the system saying that each person would be given a mentor to guide them through the process. I've had one phone call.' How can we expect bushfire victims like Ms Stanhope to access the system when there's no-one to help them navigate the system?</span>

                  </a>  Mr President, it was a very broadly introduced question, with a range of matters canvassed. The minister was clearly being directly relevant to the question asked and, as presidents of both political persuasions have ruled during the time that I have been in this chamber, the President is not in a position to tell a minister how to answer a question. The President can only require direct relevance, and the minister was being directly relevant to the question.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  On the point of order, there are several points. Firstly, I will reiterate, without restating, what I said earlier. Secondly, Senator Wong, the minister had been speaking for only 16 seconds, so I am not in a position to rule on the entirety of her approach. I have said before—and I will state it again—that when very specific questions are asked requiring facts of ministers the term 'directly relevant' will be strictly applied, as I have done. However, I have also said before that to be directly relevant a minister can directly refer to or address, including challenging, material or assertions contained in any question or preamble. The minister was being directly relevant by addressing that part of the question in the 16 seconds for which she had been speaking. Finally, there is time after question time when the merits of answers can be freely debated.</span>

First of all, I would reject the premise that if you are referring to an individual and then you move to talk about a particular action that I should think otherwise than that you are actually referring to that individual and their experience. You were talking about people getting access to mentors and you were referring to Stephanie. I don't know whether the person you were referring to or other people have had access to these particular mentors. I assume they have. I am more than happy to find out for you, Senator Watt, as to the merit or otherwise of the accusation that you are making—that because the person that you are referring to hadn't had access to a mentor it meant that everybody didn't have access to a mentor. What I would say is that this government takes very seriously— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The government is obviously very focused on making sure that we protect all Australians during this particular time, and that includes those people who have been impacted by bushfires. I would say that the substantial programs that have been put in place for the bushfire support measures are going a long way to assisting Australian who have been impacted by bushfires. But, as I said to you in answer to your previous question, we acknowledge that the recovery has been hampered in some areas because of the impacts of COVID. That doesn't mean to say that the extensive programs that have been put in place to take up the bushfire recovery efforts have not been very, very significant. The small business support that was put in place by Senator Cash, with grants up to $10,000 that people were able to get access to, the small business grants of up to $50,000 for many within the local government areas that have been designated— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I acknowledge his work as part of the many pieces of the puzzle that led, as Senator Payne has outlined to the chamber already, to the successful signing of the comprehensive strategic partnership between Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Morrison last week and has helped to drive India to the point of being Australia's fifth-largest export market. It is a significant relationship for us nowadays.</span>

It reflected very much the fact that in 2019 Australia's resources and energy exports to India were worth almost $13 billion, with metallurgical coal feeding India's ambitious steel manufacturing targets as well as amounts of gas, gold and copper, helping to fuel India's development and supporting Australian industries.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is equally delivering on growth strategies in the agricultural sector, with training on biosecurity treatments to improve the flow of agricultural products between our two countries. The Australia-India Council has funded Pulse Australia to produce regular guidance notes to better forecast Indian demand for agricultural commodities, and we're developing a grains partnership. We've extended the Australia-India Strategic Research Fund, with $15 million through to 2023-24 to pursue deeper economic engagement through collaboration in science and innovation. This includes sharing our mining equipment, technology and services expertise in the Indian market, once again helping to grow our economy and India's economy as part of a strong strategic and mutually beneficial partnership.</span>

Senator Canavan more than anybody else in this place, I'm sure, has contributed to that focus, including the joint announcements he made in the development of Australia's Critical Minerals strategy and the new financing measures to help build the critical minerals sector. Our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with India includes an MOU on cooperation in the field of mining and processing of critical and strategic minerals to increase the flow of trade, investment and R&amp;D in critical minerals, including rare earths. We've taken a significant step towards establishing ourselves as a reliable supplier of the critical minerals needed to grow India's manufacturing sector and its defence and space capabilities as we seek to grow our own. The Critical Minerals Facilitation Office is regularly engaged with its Indian counterparts to highlight Australia's potential as a reliable supplier of rare earths elements, and the MOU will strengthen that ongoing dialogue and trade. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Around one in five Australian jobs now depends on trade, and under our government we have seen an increase of more than 18 per cent in the number of Australian businesses who export goods to the world. Equally, there is strong growth in the services sector. In both of these areas we see real potential for stronger growth in the India relationship.</span>

Senator Cormann has on I think six occasions, in answers to a number of questions over the past two days, declined to express regret or offer an apology to people who have been the victims of the illegal robodebt scheme, including Nadia Sievewright, including Kath Madgwick and including Rachel, who was referred to today. Can the minister explain his refusal to offer a regret or an apology when the Prime Minister has just now apologised in the House?</span>

As I've indicated, Services Australia makes $180 billion in payments a year. We received advice at the time the program was put together that it was lawful, and indeed many governments have used ATO averaging data over many years—Labor and Liberal. Indeed, Ms Plibersek, Mr Shorten and Mr Bowen have previously indicated that it is appropriate to seek to recover debts. But it should be done in a lawful fashion. As I indicated yesterday, of course it should not have happened in a way that was unlawful.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen the parlous state of this government's morals on display today and ever since this scandalous robodebt was put in place back in 2016. There has been no regret or apology from the government about this issue until today, and there is still none from the finance minister, or from Senator Ruston, who has had to oversee this program. Every inch of the way in this place, time and time again, this government came in and tried to justify income averaging of ATO data and comparing that to the details that people properly reported to Centrelink as a justifiable way of issuing and raising debt notices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hundreds of thousands of these debt notices have been sent, and I, like many others—and I'm sure it happened to those opposite as well—have had people in tears calling our offices about these debt notices. People have been demonstrating profound mental health impacts because of these debt notices. And what did I hear back from the government? 'Well, if you don't owe a debt, you've got nothing to worry about.' But that was far from the case. The onus of proving you didn't owe a debt was on you. That is a breach of any debt policy and any debt law around this country. Debt collectors aren't supposed to be able to come after you unless they've got legitimate proof that a debt is owed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government had no legitimate proof that these debts were owed. Why? It is because they calculated these debts on a completely spurious basis. Senator Cormann said, 'Oh, well, the opposition, when in government, used to use ATO information to issue debt notices.' And, indeed, we did. But we had a pair of eyes—human engagement—to work out whether the debt was valid or not and whether it had been properly calculated. Even then, people had a proper process where they could have explained to them how their debt was calculated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have sat on the phone with Centrelink officials, asking them, 'How did you calculate this person's debt?' and they have refused to say how they had done it. They simply refused to say how they had calculated someone's debt. They refused to say, 'Actually, what we've done here is average out how much they earned in that financial year and used it to calculate whether we think, by averaging that out, they would have been eligible for income support over that time.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The simple fact is that someone is entirely entitled to income support. Say, for example, that in the first half of the year you're working from July to October, that you have a reasonably well-paid job, and that then you lose your job. Maybe you get a little bit of casual work after that. Then, for the rest of the financial year, you're on income support. Centrelink took that money which you earned in the first half of the financial year, averaged it out and then said, 'We think you might have been claiming payments and we think you've got a debt.' No, it wasn't that they thought you'd been claiming payments; they said: 'Here is your debt notice. Here is the notice that says that you owe us money because you claimed payments from us improperly. And, if you think otherwise, please bring us your payslips and your bank statements and prove it to us that you don't owe the government money.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is spurious and outrageous, and it is absolutely incredible to me that it has taken until 2020, when this bad behaviour started back in 2016, for this government to be properly called out on it. And it took the courts to do it, not the blatant unfairness, not the complete lack of morals and not the mental health impacts of this policy on people. No! We had to have the issue go to court. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's near enough to fantasy, because as we try to paint recipients of the assistance of the Australian taxpayer in their time of need as victims we forget something really important: that is, that assistance from the taxpayer comes with a set of obligations. When someone makes an application for income support—let's say it's for any kind of income support payment, really—they're told two really important things. One is that they've got to report their income and that they have to do it every fortnight.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people who have received these notices weren't just sent a debt collector to go and knock on the door. Yes, there was a computerised exercise of matching ATO records to what people had reported by way of income, an observation by that process that they didn't match and, in doing so, a process of averaging through the year was used. It turns out that wasn't the world's most accurate process. But it remains the case that the income support recipient has the obligation to accurately report their income. If they're doing that, they're not going to end up with a problem. If they get a notice through this data-matching process, as occurred in this case, it asks them to provide evidence of their income. If they engage with that process, as is their obligation, then they're not going to end up with a debt; there's going to be an accurate assessment of these things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, if we're talking about people who stick their heads in the sand—people who refuse to engage with their obligation to provide information to Centrelink so that the taxpayer can support those people in the measure reflected by law—then there's going to be a problem. Obligation is a two-way street; those who receive support from the Commonwealth have to do their best to make sure that accurate information is reported, just as the Commonwealth has to do its best to make sure we're assessing these things accurately.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I won't have Senator Pratt stand up here and take note of the answers to questions today and pretend that there is some moral objection from the Labor side to the use of a computer based measure to match the income reporting data with employment data for Centrelink recipients, because that is false. I can direct those opposite to so many examples from their own ministers when they were in government in which they expressed support for precisely the same thing. Let me direct Senator Pratt to a few examples. Mr Shorten said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The automation of this process will free up resources and result in more people being referred to the tax garnishee process, retrieving more outstanding debt on behalf of taxpayers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Shorten didn't have a massive problem with the idea that we should recover debts using a computer based matching program. How about Mr Bowen? Mr Bowen had some things to say about this. When he had responsibility for this area, he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is important that the Government explores different means of debt recovery to ensure that those who have received more money than they are entitled to repay their debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So Mr Bowen is okay with being responsible on this front. Mr Bowen is okay with people being required to repay excess benefits that they receive from the taxpayer because income hasn't been properly reported. And what about Ms Plibersek? She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… if people fail to come to an arrangement to settle their debts, the Government has a responsibility to taxpayers to recover that money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, it's an uncontroversial concept. But those opposite seem to forget that that is exactly what they argued for in government. We're not ashamed to say that we're going to do the right thing by the Australian taxpayer. We're going to make sure we support those in need, but we're also going to make sure that those who are overpaid repay their debts. All the bleating in the world doesn't change that responsibility. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  Two points seem to have come through in Senator Stoker's five minutes regarding obligations: what were the government's obligations, and what are the government's obligations in dealing with this matter immediately? They have their heads in the sand. I would suggest that perhaps those opposite need to have a good look at what that actually means. It seems the inability to say sorry and to mean it runs deep in the coalition's DNA. We've heard, and we continue to hear, heartbreaking evidence about the impact of the government's damaging and, as it turns out, illegal scheme. So why not apologise to the people for imposing this terrible scheme on them?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard evidence that it has cost some people their livelihoods, homes, families, peace of mind and even their lives. It is shameful. It's unconscionable that not a single person in the government's ranks can say the word 'sorry'. You cannot admit you were wrong to hound the families of deceased people demanding payment. You cannot admit you were wrong to inflict a bureaucratic nightmare on people and try and force them into repaying money they didn't have for debts they did not incur.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government expected people in trauma to answer questions about circumstances from years ago and threatened them with debt recovery—action, straightaway, if they didn't answer immediately. Yet this government, the minister and the Prime Minister will not even answer the most basic questions about how this illegal robodebt scheme was designed and implemented. The minister has dodged and ducked, thrown up flimsy claims of public interest immunity and just plain refused to answer questions about robodebt. Have a look at the transcripts of Senate estimates of the many times we have tried to pursue this line of questioning. Have a look at the transcripts of our community affairs inquiries and you will see that this line of questioning is never answered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister does need to step up and answer the questions about how robodebt came into being and when the government was first made aware that what they were doing was illegal. The Prime Minister does need to answer the questions about how much this botched robodebt scheme is going to cost Australians in reality. It's now been suggested that the true value of all the debt notices unlawfully issued under this scheme will exceed $1 billion, not the $720 million the government promised last month it would repay to the 373,000 welfare recipients that received the unlawful demands for money. Since 2015, a total of $2.1 billion is estimated to have been raised through the robodebt program. So what about those gaps between what the government says it will repay, what we now learn it will probably end up repaying and how much it's actually raked in under this unlawful scheme? What exactly does the government consider as lawful and unlawful debts, and how is it deciding this? The government won't answer any of these questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's make it clear what is happening here. The government hounded and harassed Australians for debts that they had not lawfully incurred, and they will now repay some of the money they gouged from people. They will spend hundreds of millions of dollars on this exercise. I'm not talking about even the potential fees—the legal fees and damages payments that may arise from ongoing legal action against robodebt. I'm also not adding onto this what the government has paid out to the debt collection firms for hounding and harassing Australians into paying these false debts. The previous senator, Senator Stoker, spoke about how these debt collection firms weren't knocking on doors. Well, there are different stories out there from Australians who've got their own way of telling how they were made to repay these debts. It has been a complete fiasco, and the depths of this fiasco have yet to be thoroughly examined. It seems every day there are more and more revelations about the complete and utter disaster of robodebt, and the government knew this. It knew robodebt was wrong. It knew it was disastrous. It knew it was harming vulnerable people and families, yet it kept on trying to shake them down.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'SULLIVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  The government takes its responsibility in administering the welfare system incredibly seriously. It is a hallmark of Australia's system that we have such a safety net, a $180 billion safety net, there for people when they need it most, whether they're unemployed or maybe have a disability—any circumstance that they find themselves in where they're not able to earn money for themselves at that particular time. So that safety net is absolutely critical, and the integrity of that safety net is also important. This is why the Australian government takes this position very, very seriously. We spend $180 billion to support Australia's social safety net each year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recovering overpayment is a fundamental part of our welfare system. If someone has a debt, the government is legally obliged to pursue recovery of that debt. This debt recovery process has been a feature of our welfare system for over 30 years. It's not new. It's not something that just started, as has been put here today. It's something that's been going on for a long time. It's part of the integrity of the system. If someone has been overpaid or if someone was in receipt of a payment that they were maybe not entitled to, it is the legal responsibility of the government to ensure that debt is recovered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian taxpayer expects us to ensure the integrity of the welfare system. Every year, about a month of a taxpayer's salary goes into funding the welfare system. So the first four to five weeks of every year that taxpayers work is funding the social services, welfare safety net that Australians have come to rely on, which is absolutely critical. So there is an expectation upon this government to ensure the integrity of this system. Australians rightly expect that the government is the resolute custodian of these taxpayers' funds and will work diligently to prevent and recover overpayments. Australians rightly expect the government to be a resolute custodian of taxpayer funds and to work diligently to prevent and recover overpayments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In November last year, changes were made to the way debts were raised as part of the program, and, from that time, debts were no longer raised wholly or partially by using the averaged ATO income data. Income averaging was a core feature of the income compliance program. Averaging was applied where recipients did not engage to explain actual discrepancies identified between income they had reported to Services Australia and income data from the ATO. On one of the days that the committee had a look into this program, I heard evidence from representatives of Services Australia, who explained the process that had actually taken place. Firstly, a notice was sent to the recipient indicating that there may be a discrepancy between the amount that they received and the amount that Services Australia understood to be what they should have received. It wasn't a debt notice. It was simply a letter that went to people to say that there were discrepancies between the amount that the person received and the amount that we would expect, after averaging and after looking at the data, that the person should have received. There was an invitation for that person to engage with Services Australia to explain and provide other evidence to show that maybe the estimation was wrong. So it wasn't the case that debt notices were just sent out. There was an opportunity for people to speak to a human. Senator Pratt, who spoke earlier, said it was just a computer doing these things. It wasn't. There was an opportunity for people to speak to someone over the telephone or even in person or to go to Centrelink and have a chat about the situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is remedying this situation. Payments have been made and refunds have been paid to people. We will continue to work through this program to ensure that the integrity of our welfare system is intact, so that we can ensure that taxpayers, who expect us to keep the system intact, are confident that this government is behaving responsibly with the taxes that they pay.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="259819" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  It's funny, isn't it? We heard an apology today in the House from the Prime Minister—an apology of sorts, I would call it—on this robodebt scheme, but it seems that members opposite didn't quite get the memo, because they don't really seem very sorry. They still seem particularly defiant and particularly proud of what they did under this scheme. There's not even a sprinkle of 'sorry' from senators opposite. Maybe that's because they weren't communicated with in regard to this apology today, but I believe that it's because they aren't apologetic at all. This decision, brought about by court action against the government, is a win for 470,000 vulnerable Australians who will be repaid what was thought to be $721 million but which now looks like it will be upwards of a billion dollars. Talk about economic management from the government! This was a dodgy scheme launched by Scott Morrison when he was Treasurer. Minister Stuart Robert, Minister Ruston and Minister Porter all had a hand in the scheme as well, and they should apologise too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Robodebt relied on ATO income averaging data to issue debt notices to people who were in a weaker position to defend themselves when they received those letters. It's interesting to hear members opposite talk about someone picking up the phone and calling Centrelink and everything will be fine. If you've ever had to stand in the line at Centrelink or call Centrelink, you will be very aware that this government has put staffing caps into Centrelink and that a lot of labour hire jobs have been used to fill the gaps. The call wait times just keep going up and up. We've heard in estimates over many years that not only did they issue this robodebt scheme but they also made it harder to get help from Centrelink when people needed it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak today about the effect this scheme had on North Queensland, because we do know that, in Townsville, debt notices were being issued by this government in the aftermath of the 2019 floods, despite assurances that debt collection was not being pursued.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put on record my thanks and appreciation to the Townsville Community Legal Service, particularly the principal solicitor there, Michael Murray. It was about a year ago that I travelled to Townsville and met with Michael and his team, who were some of the first people to identify debt notices being sent through to Townsville residents in the aftermath of the floods. And maybe it was that issue that really personalised this terrible, terrible scheme for many people in the community. There's something about floods that has a unique impact on people when they're sent a debt notice where the onus of proof has been reversed and they are the ones who have been told that they need to prove that they do not owe a debt, to go and get payslips for the last five years; and go and find information. People in Townsville were being sent these notices even after the floods had destroyed their homes and destroyed their records. How were these people supposed to prove that they didn't owe a debt to the government under those circumstances? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even when presented with this evidence in this chamber, Minister Ruston continued to deny that debt collection was being enforced in Townsville, that robodebt was taking place in Townsville after the floods. Stuart Robert also claimed that this was a false rumour. Well, this is the same minister who falsely blamed the shutdown of the myGov website on a cyberattack, so we'll take his word with a grain of salt. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to see an apology from the minister for social services and an apology directly to those residents in Townsville who received debt notices under the robodebt scheme in the aftermath of the floods that was denied in this chamber when we knew that it was true, when those residents knew it was true. I also want to see this government do more than give an apology: I want to see them come out and say that they will not introduce legislation to bring back robodebt. That would be a massive slap in the face for hundreds of thousands of people who have already been targeted by this scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the minister gave a very short response. He said yes, but failed to outline to the Australian people why indeed the arts matter here in Australia, to our community and to society, particularly at a time when we know not only that the arts and entertainment sector is the hardest hit during COVID-19—because of the lockdowns, because of the almost instantaneous shutdown of venues, cancellation of gigs, hundreds of thousands of jobs lost virtually overnight—but also that it's been Australia's arts and entertainment industry that have helped us get through these times of crisis, to get through the lockdown. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What were Australians doing during the period when everything was closed and people were being told to stay at home? They were watching Australian films. They were watching Australian TV shows. They were listening to Australian music. They were reading Australian books. They were engaging with creativity that has come from the minds and imaginations of Australia's creative artists. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason we need to ask this question about whether the arts matter is that this government has failed to put on the table an industry-specific package to help the arts and the entertainment sector. But, of course, we know they're rolling out schemes and programs for other industries—the building and construction industry, the home renovation package. They've given industry packages to some within the aviation industry. We know, of course, that their hand-picked, stacked COVID commission is full of people who are friends of the fossil fuel industry and who want to see more money for gas and coal. But of course the hundreds and thousands of Australians who are actually out of work in the arts and entertainment industry have been given nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister did say a week ago that he had some revelation that something was needed. Well, where is it? A week on, and still nothing from this government. Months and months have gone by with Australian artists and entertainers left out in the cold, and still nothing from this government. Venues are closed, businesses are going to the wall and, of course, many of the businesses in the arts and entertainment industry are small businesses that employ a handful of people, gig by gig. Many of those people don't even have access to JobKeeper, let alone the industry-specific package that's desperately needed. So, yes, art does matter. It matters a whole lot, but this government fails to recognise that and it fails to do anything about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at those industries where they have put money in. They're pretty blokey. They're pretty much in line with what the Prime Minister likes; he likes his footy and he likes his home renovations. Fourteen per cent of construction and building industry employees are women—14 per cent of those who work in the building and construction industry are women. Who have lost their jobs in this crisis? The majority of workers who have lost their jobs in this crisis happen to be women. It's industries which have high numbers of female participation. More women have lost their jobs during COVID-19 than men, and where is the money and the support for those female workers?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the gender split in the arts and entertainment industry is fifty-fifty. What else has the government done? They've cut the support to child care—more women in jobs—and then it's going to be even harder for the women who need the child care in order to get back into the workforce. So I ask the question: does the government care about the arts? That's debatable. Does the government think that arts jobs are real jobs? There's a big question mark over that. And does the government think that women's work is worth it? There's a very big question mark hanging over that question. Jobs for the boys and not many for the women.</span>

                  </a>  I thank the Senate. Formal business is the time in the Senate's routine of business which allows for motions to be dealt with in an expedited manner. Formal motions cannot be amended without leave from every senator, and they cannot be debated. As such, they should not deal with complex policy matters. Such motions are better dealt with in general business when there can be proper debate and when all interested senators have the opportunity to appropriately nuance and flesh out the complexity of all the issues raised by a particular motion. Each senator is also afforded the opportunity to raise issues and present their arguments at other times during a sitting week, including during the adjournment debate, senators' statements and debates on legislation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When making judgements on whether something relates to a complex policy matter or not we cannot ignore the context in which relevant statements are made in the motion seeking the Senate's endorsement. This is why the government intends to deny formality for notice of motion Nos 604 and 612 in relation to Indigenous disadvantage. The government is committed to improving the lives of Indigenous Australians so this generation and future generations of Indigenous Australians can have the same expectations and opportunities as any other Australian. We're committed to closing the gap on a set of targets that will empower Indigenous Australians to transform their lives. We are doing this in partnership with Indigenous Australians in a non-partisan way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of us need to keep our eyes firmly focused on the outcomes we want to achieve. In that context, we do not believe that dealing with either of those motions in formal business would be helpful in achieving better outcomes for Indigenous Australians or for any Australian.</span>

We don't agree with the government's decision to deny formality on notice of motion No. 604—a motion Labor supports. However, we do oppose general business notice of motion No. 612 to be moved by Senator Pauline Hanson. We agree with the government's decision to deny formality because we think it is not appropriate to spend this Senate's time inciting division. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Colleagues, yesterday we heard a powerful contribution from our esteemed colleague Senator Dodson, and we have much to learn from him. Asserting black lives matter isn't saying that other lives do not matter. It is responding to a systemic structural problem where black lives are not given equal value. Those who want to reinforce that status quo, including white supremacists, have instead adopted the phrase that is used in Senator Hanson's motion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen also from this Prime Minister the kinds of carefully timed interventions and coded language that have been used in the United States that are designed to create tension but maintain plausible deniability. The dismissal of Indigenous Australians and those moved to act in their support as 'seeking to take advantage of these opportunities to push their political causes' is an echo of arguments used against demonstrators in the United States and also the language used to dismiss concerns, prevent progress and entrench discrimination for decades. Labor says this: standing against racism and discrimination is principled and it is just, and it should not be delegitimised in this way. I know the Prime Minister and President Trump have made much of what friends they are and how much they have in common, but there are some things we do not wish to import. Leaders must bring the community together, and this includes listening to our First Nations's voices in this country, which we have too often ignored.</span>

                  </a>  Unfortunately, we were not advised of the content or the fact that the contribution from the Leader of the Government in the Senate was even happening, so forgive my lack of preparation. I want to put our position on the record. We too were extremely concerned about the content of notice of motion No. 612 to be moved by that regular bringer of dissent into this place. It is completely sidelining the whole point of black lives matter and tries to delegitimise the issue. So we agree that that motion is totally inappropriate. We would have opposed it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Labor Party were going to vote with us in support of our own notice of motion No. 604. That is a perfectly appropriate motion. We are concerned at the trend of this government disallowing from discussion certain matters in motions when they happen to be a little bit inconvenient for the government. So, whilst we support the fact that a divisive motion won't proceed, complex foreign policy matters—which seem to be determined at the whim of this government, because they bring their own so-called complex foreign policy matters whenever they like—are disallowed in this place and now it seems that the government can unilaterally decide that other motions can also be denied formality. So, whilst we won't object to the denial of formality to motion 612, I do want to note that we are concerned at this trend of the government unilaterally denying discussion in this chamber and putting it off to general business, which we all know happens on an infrequent basis and requires other machinations in order to get certain issues raised.</span>

I cannot believe that you are not prepared to put this to the vote in the notice of motions. If you are not prepared to put it to a vote, then the answer to that is you don't care about all lives matter. That's what it's about. Otherwise you would put it and you would vote on it, but you're stopping the formality with it. What are you so concerned about?</span>

Stop dividing this nation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am pleased to introduce the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2020. This Bill makes technical amendments to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 </span>and is mirrored by amendments to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 </span>to ensure consistency across all electoral events.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These amendments remedy anomalies in legislation and improve clarity, to enhance electoral processes and allow greater workforce flexibility for the Australian Electoral Commission, so they can use more modern workplace practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill progresses technical amendments that were previously supported by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and carried over from the last Parliament. These amendments were deferred to facilitate passage of only the most urgent amendments ahead of the 2019 federal election. This Bill also includes further technical amendments proposed by the AEC following the 2019 federal election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill contains a number of measures variously designed to modernise electoral processes, build greater workforce flexibility to allow the AEC to streamline election delivery, and strengthen electoral integrity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill includes necessary amendments in response to the High Court decision in <span style="font-style:italic;">Spence vs State of Queensland </span>to better clarify the interaction between federal and State electoral laws. These amendments narrow the operation of provisions that were passed in the last Parliament, to reflect the High Court's findings about the exact limits of the Commonwealth's legislative power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The revised provisions ensure that federal law only applies exclusively to donations that are expressly for federal purposes, while fully respecting the application of state laws to amounts used for state purposes. The new rules do not purport to apply federal law exclusively to amounts that are 'untied', namely donations that are not specifically pledged to either a federal or state purpose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure integrity, the revised rules provide that if a donation is initially made for federal purposes but is subsequently used for a non-federal purpose, then the recipient will lose any immunity from state or territory law for receiving or keeping the gift. For example a political party may need to disclose the amount under state law and may be liable for penalties if the donation was not permitted under state law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also clarifies changes made through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Electoral</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Legislation Amendment (Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform) Act 2018</span>. These changes simplify and clarify funding and entitlement rules including the rounding and indexation of public funding entitlements for eligible candidates, parties and groups.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It makes clear for avoidance of doubt that public funding for joint Senate tickets is split in proportions decided by the relevant parties and the Bill allows amendments of public funding applications, including permitting applicants to clarify or add information to justify their claim;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It also fixes an unintended contradiction between rules related to the de-registration and registration of political campaigners and associated entities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill allows greater workforce flexibility for the AEC and more nationally consistent processes. For instance, it allows the Electoral Commissioner to devolve functions of a Divisional Returning Officer to other AEC officials. This enables the AEC to more effectively utilise its resources to ensure greater service delivery to its stakeholders, while maintaining public confidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill reduces unnecessarily prescriptive practices, including by allowing the AEC to use the most effective postal services; permitting them to supply pens as well as pencils in polling places; and allowing variation in the order of the three questions that must be asked of voter's to ascertain their entitlement to vote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill removes the obligation for Divisional Offices to be pre-poll voting centres, as many are not suitable due to poor access for people with mobility issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A particularly welcome reform is to permit party and candidate names to be printed under a preference box on a Senate ballot instead of alongside it, to reduce the possibility of one metre wide Senate ballot papers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Removing stringent rules where they do not always work, will reduce public confusion, without diminishing the integrity of the electoral process.</span>
                </p>

                  </a>  Labor would ask that the question be put separately on (a) and (b) and indicate that we will be supporting clause (a) of the motion but we oppose clause (b). That is largely due to issues of the imputations that it places on members of this place and of the other chamber. Really, it's just a stunt motion designed specifically to distract from the deaths of Indigenous Australians in custody and the overrepresentation of Indigenous Australians in our justice system. But certainly the (b) clause of the motion does pass judgement and negative imputations on members in this place and of the other and, as such, we think it's disorderly and probably out of order.</span>

                  </a>  Over this triennium the ABC will receive $3.2 billion—over a billion dollars per year. This investment by the government gives the ABC more financial security than any other media organisation in the nation. The government's investment in the ABC is an important underpinning of media diversity and a significant contribution to civic journalism in Australia. GetUp engaged a consulting firm to prepare a report that incorrectly concluded that the ABC has lost $783 million in funding since 2014. The ABC's funding has not decreased, and budget papers indicate that funding in 2019-20 is higher than in 2013-14 and that funding will be higher again in the year 2021-22.</span>

                  </a>  We oppose this. The ABC had the time and the money to indulge their personal hostility to President Trump by using a video that stitched together two unrelated videos to make it falsely appear the President was claiming George Floyd would be looking down from heaven thinking President Trump's job figures were a great thing to happen when he was really referring to his improved policing fairness order. Rather than needing more money, the cuts to the ABC need to go far further. When the ABC double-down on their fake news by claiming the broadcast was a direct quote from the President, the cuts need to go far further. When the ABC reports that US employment fell when, in fact, employment rose by 2.5 million in a single month, the cuts need to go far further. The ABC are fake news and do not deserve the funding they fraudulently steal under false pretences.</span>

                  </a>  I have to say: shame on the Liberals for putting on par a motion put up by Senator Pauline Hanson on 'all lives matter' and the Greens' motion on 'black lives matter'. Senator Hanson's motion refuses to acknowledge the inequalities that exist for our Indigenous people in Australia in terms of discrimination, disadvantage, violence and marginalisation, whereas the Greens' motion is actually about us here, today, acknowledging all those disadvantages and that discrimination. It is actually about state violence in Australia that still exists against Indigenous people in Australia. It is about committing us all and the government to doing something about it. If you don't want to do something about it, don't try and hide behind motions. Have the guts to take a position and vote likewise. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Thankfully, Australia has managed to contain COVID-19. States with closed borders, including Queensland, have done particularly well. We've contained COVID-19 by listening to our health experts. Queensland's Chief Health Officer, along with many of her interstate counterparts, has been clear: opening our state borders too quickly could lead to a second wave. That would be devastating for our health, our jobs and our economy. We all want Queensland borders opened, when it is safe to open them. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know what this motion is about. It's a political attack on a state government that is putting Queensland first. There is no motion today calling on the Liberal states of Tasmania and South Australia to open their borders. I wonder why! If the LNP actually cared about Queensland workers, they would oppose their own government's snapback of JobKeeper. They would demand their own government save Virgin. But this isn't about Queenslanders or Queensland jobs. This is a Greens-style political stunt. My Labor Party colleagues and I make no apologies for standing with Queenslanders to put Queensland first. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This is one of the sectors heavily affected, and rightly it's being supported.</span>

                    </a>  The government's Commonwealth Integrity Commission, the CIC, is properly designed, having gone through a robust consultation phase and properly funded, with $106.7 million of new money allocated to it in the budget over the forward estimates—nearly double what Labor planned to allocate to it. As a result of COVID-19, the release of the exposure draft CIC legislation has been delayed. Importantly, the government's immediate focus has been to keep Australians safe and provide the support framework needed to help businesses and protect jobs. The exposure draft legislation will be released at an appropriate time after more-immediate priorities concerning the management of COVID-19 recovery have been dealt with.</span>

This payment is specifically to encourage direct care workers providing clinical care and personal care to remain in their employment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Extra income of up to $1,600 will be paid to eligible residential direct care workers and up to $1,200 to eligible direct home care workers who are eligible and work through both cycles of payments.

                  </a>  Over this triennium, the ABC will receive $3.2 billion, which is over $1 billion a year. This investment from taxpayers gives the ABC more financial security than any other media organisation across the country. The government's investment in the ABC is important in underpinning media diversity and is a significant contribution to civic journalism across the country. As stated before, GetUp engaged a consulting firm to prepare a report that incorrectly concluded that the ABC had lost $783 million in funding since 2014. ABC funding has not decreased, and the budget papers indicate that funding in 2019-20 is, in fact, higher than it was in 2013-14 and will be higher again in the year 2021-22.</span>

We believe issuing a running commentary—and we acknowledge the Greens have drafted this motion in a way that forces that—on court decisions is not how you protect the environment or ensure certainty in regional employment. It's reckless for the Greens to claim that the decision sets an important legal precedent. Labor support the social, economic and environmental benefits that flow from sustainable management of our native forests and support regional forest agreements. We are committed to ecologically sustainable development within the forestry industry. Furthermore, the EPBC Act is under review, and we shouldn't pre-empt it. Labor support the protection of threatened species, and we know this government isn't doing enough. The motion does nothing to address the key challenges we as a nation need to confront on climate action, protecting our environment and threatened species. For that we need real change, not motions which seek to wedge the Labor Party, which is what the Greens excel at.</span>

As is appropriate, the circumstances of Ms Smith's death are being investigated by independent bodies, including the South Australia Police, the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission and the South Australian coroner. The NDIS Commission is investigating Ms Smith's NDIS provider Integrity Care in relation to the provider's management of the incident and the actions of a former support worker. </span>

It's important to allow the investigations to be conducted in a manner that avoids prejudice to any pending or current criminal or civil proceedings.</span>

                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I rise today on behalf of the Australian Greens to introduce the Coronavirus Economic Support and Recovery (No-one Left Behind) Bill 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill does three things. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Firstly, it directs the Finance Minister to create the Coronavirus Economic Support and Recovery Fund. This would require the Minister to create a $2.3 billion recovery package for the arts and entertainment sector, a $12 billion manufacturing investment fund, a $2 billion contribution to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and a $6 billion investment in electricity transmission infrastructure. It prohibits the fund from being used to subsidise or invest in coal, oil and natural gas extraction or production or power generation, or to subsidise manufacturing processes which are solely or primarily reliant on the direct use of coal, oil or gas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Secondly it would expand the $550 per fortnight COVID-19 supplement to recipients of the disability support pension and carer payment, and ensures that holders of temporary visas are eligible for the JobSeeker payment if they otherwise meet the JobSeeker criteria. Eligibility would be back dated to 27 April 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, it would extend the JobKeeper payment scheme, requiring the Minister to create rules for the JobKeeper scheme that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">- Extend potential eligibility to all casual employees, regardless of period of employment</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">- Extend potential eligibility to all temporary visa holder employees</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">- Extend potential eligibility to intermittent workers with a demonstrated income history</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">- Include certain entities 100% owned by foreign sovereign governments within Australia as eligible employers, including companies such as Dnata</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">- Include higher education providers as eligible employers</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">- Facilitate prompt back payment of newly eligible employees and employers</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To date, the global COVID-19 crisis has not only left over 400,000 dead but lead to millions facing unemployment and poverty. It has been truly unprecedented. The Morrison Government's response has been slow, dragged to action by both the states and territories and the unfolding severity of the crisis. But each day we learn of new shortcomings, of communities left behind or skewed priorities for the road ahead and we must ask ourselves one question, the question of priorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Because what exactly do decisions to date tell us of the priorities of the Government's response? What set of priorities would say that someone who had been a casual employee for only 11 months with the same employer would be treated far harsher than one with 12? What set of priorities would say that an international student should be left without income and in many cases life's essentials like food or housing purely by virtue of their visa status? What set of priorities would say that the hundreds of thousands of workers in the arts or higher education sectors should be thrown to the wolves, and the homeless ignored, while millions of dollars are handed to wealthy homeowners to re-do their kitchens?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And when we look to the recovery, to the charted path out of COVID-19, what priorities do we see there? Another round of the game of mates, as big business and the rent seekers come to collect their favours. A gas-led recovery that would see environmental protections ripped apart and public money funnelled to locking in decades of climate pollution. Billions in tax cuts for the big end of town, to the tune of over $11,000 a year for people already earning over $200,000. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So when the Government makes a $60 billion mistake, and finds that its stimulus program actually won't be stimulating the economy as much as intended, what does it do? It decides to bank it, to pay down debt. This isn't sensible economic management, it's economic sabotage. The most recent Labour Force statistics show that 600,000 jobs were lost in April alone. We are in our first recession in three decades. Now is not the time for penny pinching, it is time to support those who are doing it tough and invest in the recovery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That's why the Greens are introducing this Bill today. We say let us use this windfall to actually invest in people, and invest in the industries we want to nurture. Let's use this opportunity to expand the JobKeeper program to all casuals, to temporary visa holders, to intermittent workers and to workers at universities. Let us ensure that people with disabilities and those who care for them are able to access the resources they need to navigate this truly challenging period. And let us build the industries of the future, in arts and entertainment and higher education and renewable energy and green manufacturing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And the fight goes beyond this Bill today. As we continue to navigate the twin health and economic crises, as we emerge from the lockdowns and try to restart our economy, we need to ask ourselves what kind of society we want to build. We have a choice. We can choose to continue with the successful elements of the Government's response, by maintaining the rate of JobSeeker and keeping childcare and early childhood education fee-free. And we can create a fairer and greener Australia. We can make Australia run on 100% renewables, not only to save the climate but to power energy-intensive green manufacturing industries that actually add value to our mineral exports. We can guarantee access to universal services, like free university and TAFE that can train the next generation of workers while removing the structural inequalities that prevent young people from pursuing post-school study. We can use government investment to reach truly full employment, where everyone who wants a job has one, while making our income support system truly fair so that no one has to live in poverty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These are the choices we face. This Bill goes some way to rewriting those priorities, charting a pathway out of this moment and leaving no one behind along the way. I commend the Bill to the Senate.</span>

My question is: does that mean that there are no Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage and cultural issues that need to be dealt with in southern Australia? I also want to point out that this is a government dominated committee, and it's the very government that has not been carrying out its duties as it should be in terms of protecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage and culture. So my question is: why is it being referred to a committee that's dominated by the government when they're the ones that are involved in the decision-making on the issue that is supposed to be being investigated?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Northern Territory first gained a second seat at the 2001 election, dividing the electorate of the Northern Territory into the seats of Solomon (the urban area of Darwin and Palmerston) and Lingiari (the rest of the Northern Territory west to the border of Western Australia, south to South Australia, and east to Queensland). </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Prior to that my colleague in the other place, the Member for Lingiari, the Honourable Warren Snowdon, was the member for the electorate of the Northern Territory for 12 years. In 2001 when the electorate was divided, Warren became the member for Lingiari and he was joined by CLP member David Tollner in the newly formed seat of Solomon which is now held by Luke Gosling.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2003, the Australian Electoral Commission made a redistribution determination that would have again reduced the NT to one seat. In response to that, David Tollner introduced a private member's bill to guarantee the Territory two seats and the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters inquired into whether the Act should be amended to guarantee both the ACT and the NT two seats in the House of Representatives.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the majority of submissions to the inquiry were in support of the proposal, the Committee found that the representational entitlement method was the best method of determining the Territories' entitlement. Although the Committee recommended overturning the Commissioner's 2003 redistribution determination, it stopped short of guaranteeing the Territories two seats into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2004 the Act was amended to overturn the Electoral Commissioner's determination and retain both electoral divisions. This was largely because the shortfall for the second quota was only 295 electors and well within an acceptable margin of error. The Act was also amended at that time to introduce a margin of error calculation for future redistribution determinations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendment to the Act in 2004 only applied to the 2003 redistribution. No redistribution since then has resulted in a reduction in members in the NT, so the need for further amendments to the Act has not arisen—until now. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On the Parliamentary Library's reckoning the estimated population figures will see the NT fall short of a second quota by approximately 4,700 electors including the margin of error. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Territory's size, the remoteness of many of its communities and its unique demography all contribute to its need for more than one lower house seat.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Losing a seat would mean a single MP serving an electorate of over 1.4 million square kilometres, including the remote Indian Ocean Territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Tasmania, as an original state in the Constitution, is guaranteed five seats regardless of its size. Five members in the House of Representatives with a population of about 535,000 — we are simply asking for two elected members for the Territory's 250,000 residents.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Without legislating for a guaranteed two seats, representation in the Territory will always be at the mercy of ABS statistics. We don't know the true population because many people have not been counted in the Census. There is a historical issue with undercounting remote community populations, with issues around accessibility, language barriers and other barriers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On top of that, populations fluctuate. The Northern Territory Department of Treasury and Finance's projected population statistics predict the Territory's population will reach 251,727 by 2021, taking it over the threshold of eligibility for two seats. If these projections are correct and a redistribution this year results in the loss of a seat, the redistribution would see an outcome which is not reflective of the population at the time of the next election. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">A single electorate for the Territory would not recognise the different characteristics and communities of interest from Darwin and Palmerston to the remote regions, nor the NT's strategic and economic importance to the whole of Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">But the Territory is more than just Darwin. Without legislation, a single MP would need to divide their time between Darwin and communities like the Cocos Islands, Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Christmas Island, Katherine and Arnhem Land.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WALSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:18</span>):  Thank you to Senator Brown for the opportunity to speak on what is a critical issue right now for hundreds of thousands of Australian workers and families, and, particularly, women. Australian women are asking themselves today: does this government really prioritise $150,000 bathroom renovations over the working women of Australia? Within the space of a week, this government has decided to hand out $25,000 grants to the very few people who can, right now, afford to spend $150,000 on their home renovations. They say that's to support tradie jobs, but we all know this scheme makes absolutely no sense whatsoever because it's subsidising jobs that were already there on projects already in the pipeline. Meanwhile the government is ripping JobKeeper away from 120,000 early childhood educators, three months early and three days after they said they wouldn't do it. These are hardworking women who've done everything that's been asked of them during this pandemic to support our community. So how is it that this government sees fit to kick them off JobKeeper while handing out money for $150,000 renovations? Now they've announced they're ending free early childhood education right at the time that so many women are struggling to get back into work to support themselves and their families in the toughest of economic times. That's on top of denying JobKeeper payments to so many women in the first place—women who work as casuals and in jobs that have been the hardest hit in this pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a government that has the backs of Australian working women and this is not a government that understands the pressures that women face every day—and even more so in this COVID-19 crisis—including juggling lower-paid jobs than those of their male counterparts; casual jobs; jobs that have been shut down; juggling their caring responsibilities at home; exorbitant childcare fees; and trying to get back into work to support themselves and their families. But, as we enter Australia's first recession in almost 30 years, these are apparently the priorities of this Morrison government: giving out bathroom renovations with one hand and ripping away programs that support women with the other. For weeks now, MPs and senators on the government's back bench have been calling for an early snapback to cut off support, and now it looks like the government is giving in. This is a snapback to a complex and expensive early childhood education system that is prohibitively expensive for so many families who are now trying to get back to work. This is just so counterproductive at a time when we really need to support people to get back into jobs. This decision is going to hurt families, it's going to hurt businesses, it's going to hurt the economy and it is particularly going to hurt working women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Household budgets are under incredible stress, and the last thing that households need is to go back to paying the same exorbitant fees which they were paying back in February which had soared by 7.2 per cent in one year alone. This is going to hammer families at a time when many parents are earning less, have seen a reduction in hours or have lost their jobs. This is happening at a time when many families are desperately trying to get back on their feet. It's happening at a time when many families are struggling to put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads. A recent national survey conducted by The Parenthood found that almost half of all families had at least one parent that had lost income. For families trying to go back to work or increase their hours, this is really bad news because, for many of them, the cost of child care won't make sense versus how much they could earn at work right now. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Parenthood survey also found that ending free child care would force 60 per cent of households to reduce their work hours and 34 per cent of parents would need to reduce work days or remove their children from early childhood education altogether. That figure almost doubles to 63 per cent for those families whose incomes have been hit by this pandemic. This is going to set families back and it is going to set our economic recovery back too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the decision to end free early childhood education and care will have a much larger impact on women and their ability to work when compared with men. In The Parenthood survey, out of those households that said they would have to reduce their work hours, 68 per cent, or over two-thirds, said that it would be the women in the household whose work would have to go. This will just compound the damage already done by this crisis and by this recession, which we know has hit women the hardest. We know that more women than men have lost their jobs during this pandemic. We know that more women have lost more hours when compared with men and that women dominate the workforces of the industries that have been hit hardest by the pandemic. Women are far more likely to be casual workers, millions of whom the government has excluded from JobKeeper. Women are far more likely too to take on the extra caring responsibilities at home, which is probably contributing to the fact that they're twice as likely to have stopped looking for work right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, history tells us that many workers who find themselves out of work during a recession find themselves out of work for a long, long time. If we don't take action to support women's jobs and their capacity to work, we will potentially put at risk decades of progress when it comes to women's wages and workforce participation. So we need to see policy choices from this government that support women in the workplace right now, and it's clear that removing free early childhood education and care makes parents' return to the workforce more difficult and much more difficult for women in particular.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is really a double blow for women's jobs. At the same time as making it harder for women to return to the workforce, the government are making the job security of 120,000 early childhood educators, of whom we know 97 per cent are women, even more uncertain. Not only have they risked the stability and viability of early childhood education services around Australia by removing free child care; they're also removing early childhood educators from the JobKeeper scheme months earlier than originally planned—what a slap in the place for those hardworking women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our early childhood educators have been absolute heroes during this pandemic. Throughout it, they have faced extreme uncertainty. Some have lost their jobs and others have been fearful about the survival of the sector. Many have been fearful for their own health as well as they've gone to work. Social distancing is just not an option in early learning centres when working with small children. But, through it all, hundreds of thousands of educators continued to go to work, caring for and educating our children. And they did it with absolute professionalism every day. We all need to be saying a massive thankyou to our educators, not making their work even more insecure during this recession. They are essential workers that are too often undervalued, and their professionalism allowed other essential workers to continue to do their jobs too. So why is it that the government is kicking these workers off JobKeeper first? It's concerning that this government thinks it's appropriate to remove JobKeeper from these workers at such a crucial time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's even more concerning that the government has said that more so-called adjustments could take place for other workers into the future. It was only last Friday that the Prime Minister guaranteed that workers would be able to rely on JobKeeper until September. Three days later and that promise, like so many others, was broken. This time it was broken for 120,000 early childhood educators. It's not just that these decisions are bad for working women; they are bad for the economy as a whole and they are bad for the recovery. Economists have been warning for weeks not to remove support packages like JobKeeper too early and free child care too early. Why? Because it risks jobs and it risks our recovery. The government needs to be doing all it can to create jobs and support parents and women to get back into work. Women have been hardest hit by this economic crisis, but there is no need for them to miss out on the government's economic support as the economy recovers. The end of free childcare education is the start of the snapback—a snapback that will be bad for workers, bad for families and bad for women. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245212" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  I, too, at the start of my contribution would like to recognise the hard work and commitment of those involved in the childcare sector. They were pretty tense times a few months ago. We clearly and rightly recognised the workers on the frontline of our health system at that time, continuing to be there in response to this coronavirus crisis. But there were other crucial sectors as well that contributed to keeping all Australians safe, and our childcare sector was an essential one because, without those types of services, the healthcare workers that we essentially need couldn't continue to do their jobs. Many of them relied on having access to childcare services so they could be at testing centres, be at fever clinics and be adjusting our intensive care facilities in preparation for what we thought might, or feared might, occur. That's why the government acted very early and swiftly to put in place arrangements to help childcare places stay there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The concern, obviously, at the beginning of this situation was that large numbers of parents, if they didn't have to go to work or their older children weren't going off to school, would also take their children out of child care and that that would cause a spiral for the economics of childcare centres and that, if they were only servicing the essential workers in the middle of a pandemic or a broader lockdown, they would not have the money to survive. They would not have the money to stay open, and then they wouldn't be open for the essential workers. That domino effect, so to speak, was what the government was responding to when it introduced what was always intended to be a temporary package. We would no longer charge parents fees—I'll come back to this in detail—but the government would provide, I think, around 50 per cent, about half, of a childcare centre's normal revenue. That would be provided by the government to help them keep open, and the JobKeeper scheme was also made available to help them effectively get the other half, if you like.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the scheme was correctly designed for what we feared was going to be a significant increase in coronavirus numbers and a significant reduction in Australians working, or at least physically attending workplaces, and the scheme has been successful, at least in terms of childcare centres remaining open. The review that has been recently completed found that 99 per cent of the around 13½ thousand childcare services around the country remained operational as at 8 May, so the objectives of the scheme have been clearly met. That's not to say, though, that there weren't some unintended consequences of it. It was always a scheme designed for a particular fallout in the economy. It did actually make it hard for some childcare centres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a complex situation, but it's one that has been glossed over by Labor senators because it's unhelpful for the slogans and the headlines that they're seeking to pursue here. But either they are ignorant of the complexities of the childcare sector—or haven't made themselves familiar with them—or they're just wilfully ignoring those complexities. I think it's the latter, because I'm sure they've been contacted by childcare centres in the last few months, in the same way I have been, and I'm sure they have had the same issues raised with them about this particular package.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The primary issue is that our scheme was all about keeping a childcare centre open for business, not necessarily viable at 100 per cent of its capacity. Because we required no fee from parents—so they couldn't charge a fee—that meant, of course, that revenue sources available to a childcare centre were limited to the government's support plus the JobKeeper subsidy. For some centres, that did not actually add up to 100 per cent of their capacity. Now, we thought that wouldn't be an issue, because there was going to be a significant reduction in utilisation of childcare centres. That has not always worked out, because we have not had the fallout. Thankfully, it's been a good outcome that we haven't had the fallout and that we haven't had an increase in coronavirus cases. So there were many cases, which I'm sure have been raised with Labor senators and with Greens senators, where centres were not able to keep 100 per cent of spots open, even though parents were willing to pay money. Parents were willing to pay fees to help centres stay open, but we said, 'No, we want to make child care free through this period to keep them open.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a perverse outcome, which has been reported on. On 10 June the Ballarat <span style="font-style:italic;">Courier</span> reported that Sebastopol's Brady Bunch Learning Centre had a waiting list of 30 families and daily inquiries about childcare facilities. I had childcare facilities throughout Queensland contact me. I won't name them, because I don't want to embarrass them, but there were many who said, 'We want to provide more services.' I have spoken to many parents in Rockhampton. They want to pay for child care; they're happy to. They've got jobs. They're lucky enough to still have jobs, but they don't have places, because they are being rationed. That's what happens when you put price controls in place—you get rationing. And that's why we've had to make sure that we adjust to the circumstances we have right now and that we adjust to the fact that we have not had the fallout in coronavirus numbers. We have not had the reduction in working that we thought we would have, and effectively returning to the old system, with some transitional assistance—that's key—is the best way to go about things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing I'm sure you will not hear from Labor and Greens senators in their contributions is the reaction of much of the childcare sector itself to the government's announcement that we would transition back. For example, Josephine Tait, the CEO of the Weipa Community Care Association in Cape York in my state of Queensland, said, 'We are pleased the government has listened to our requests and has vowed to implement some very favourable changes.' Emma Murphy, the CEO of Kids Capers Childcare in Queensland, employs 200 staff across eight centres and she said, 'It's really exciting to see that early educators have been recognised and federal government funding has changed and adapted to help the community.' The Australian Childcare Alliance has commended the Australian government for putting a transition process in place that supports the early learning sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, this is a complex arrangement that we have in place to help support parents in their childcare needs. The childcare subsidy, which we are re-implementing, ensures that those who are on low incomes have the vast majority of their fees subsidised by the taxpayer. Up to 85 per cent of childcare fees are subsidised through the childcare subsidy payment. In fact, under the childcare subsidy, out-of-pocket costs for parents were less than $5 per hour per child for 72.4 per cent of parents. The vast majority of people using child care have a job. That's why they need child care, because they've got to go and work somewhere else. They're earning a wage. They're earning a salary in that job. It's good that they've got a job. It's great that unemployment has not risen as much as we feared. Therefore, for those people who have a job, we think it's right that there is a co-contribution. But there is significant support from the government that will continue under the arrangements we have in place, with transition arrangements as we move back to a more a normal economic circumstance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the right decision to make. This is the right decision to make to support normal childcare services being widely available for Australian parents and Australian working families. That's why it is supported by those actually in the industry and those who know. What is happening though is that a commonsense response is not being pursued here in this chamber by those moving and supporting this MPI. What there is is an attempt to run a different agenda about whether or not child care should be free. That's a different debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party has not committed to making child care free—let's make that very clear. We had an election last year. They could have done that. They could have taken a policy to make it free. It would cost billions and billions of taxpayers' dollars. They didn't do that. Does the Labor Party support people earning $300,000 or $400,000 a year having their child care paid for? Is that what the Greens support? I don't think that's fair. If you're earning hundreds of thousand dollars you probably should make a contribution to your child's care. You shouldn't expect the taxpayer to have to pay for you. Those on low incomes absolutely deserve to have significant support, which they do through the childcare subsidy scheme. But for those on high incomes, those who can afford to look after their own circumstances in life, including their own children, I think, it makes sense and is fair for them to pay those costs, not to impose those on taxpayers—some of whom will earn less and be less well-to-do than themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what we're returning to. All I can finish on is by saying that the government has a track record of supporting businesses that have been hurt by coronavirus. If circumstances change, if things get worse, we will live by our track record of continuing to help assist and help Australians, making sure we survive through the coronavirus.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:38</span>):  I can honestly say that I would not have been able to complete my masters and PhD, nor embark on a career in engineering or academia, and then eventually state and federal politics, without access to affordable child care. When I migrated to Australia from Pakistan in 1992 and commenced my studies at the University of New South Wales, I pretty quickly realised that the available child care in my area was just unaffordable. It was too expensive. And that's how I got involved in a campaign to establish affordable student-centred child care at the university. We won that campaign, and that was really the only way I was able to complete my studies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have the utmost respect for those who educated and cared for my two children when I was working and studying. I will be eternally grateful to them. So it felt really personal when the University of New South Wales announced recently that it would shut down and privatise child care on campus. This is devastating as it is indicative of our society's broader undervaluing of child care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those centres—three of which my children attended at one time or another—were a lifeline to me. I had no family in Australia when I migrated here, and that meant that there were no real options for me if I wanted to work or study. It breaks my heart that very soon they may not be providing the same education and care for little ones and women like me will have very few choices left to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">COVID-19 has exposed the existing inequalities in our society, including the gendered nature of these inequalities. There is no denying the fact that this pandemic is, and will continue to be, a gendered crisis. Women have been on the front line of this crisis as nurses and others in the healthcare system, as teachers, as childcare workers and as early childhood educators. All of these women are in areas with a predominantly feminised workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More women than men have lost jobs and hours of work. Women are still doing much more of the family care work, which has skyrocketed during the pandemic—especially if you've been juggling children at home and working from home as well. Lockup and isolation at home have placed women at even more of a risk of domestic violence. So there is no doubt that the compounded impacts will be felt much more by women who already generally earn less, have less savings, have less superannuation and hold insecure casual jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When rebuilding and recovering, women and women's organisations must be front and centre of decision-making, and we must make sure that, within this group of women, those who are even further marginalised—including Indigenous women, migrant women, women of colour, women with disability and transwomen—have an equal voice so their specific needs are addressed. We have an opportunity to rebuild after the pandemic to create a more equal and just society. A shake-up of how child care works has to be central to this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the first time the government have grudgingly recognised that child care is an essential service. But they have decided to snap back from it in the middle of July, forcing millions who have lost work in the meantime to pay fees and make some really hard choices. While Labor's motion rightly points out that going back to a complex and expensive childcare subsidy system will lead to it becoming unaffordable for families, particularly women, it fails to acknowledge what we really need to do: to make free child care permanent. Thousands of Australian families have benefited enormously from fee-free access since the beginning of April. The minister should make free child care permanent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The pandemic has opened up a conversation about the long-term viability of our existing approach to child care. This is an opportunity that is too good to let slip away. The reality is that the old system, which we may soon return to, was a broken, underfunded one, with some of the highest fees in the world. There is a compelling case for free and universally available early childhood education and care. It would have enormous social and economic benefits for our community. Too often, women have to give up work and career opportunities because child care is too expensive or just not available.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In our patriarchal society, our entire economy relies on the unpaid and underpaid work of women in caring roles and the skilled, difficult work done at childcare centres and in early learning and education. It's just an extension of the work that women do. Investing to make child care free and well funded and supporting carers and educators are essential to dismantling these retrograde ideas. Rather than doing that, the government is going to end JobKeeper for early childhood educators and the care sector before all other workers in Australia. How unfair and how insulting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We women have known that child care is an essential service, but now this view must stick. The gaps that have emerged in our childcare system should, of course, be fixed as we move to make child care free and universally available. In the long term, I know that, to achieve this, our work is cut out for us. We must work together to lock in the right to free and universal child care for all, with higher wages and better conditions for workers to reflect the value of their enormous contribution to our community and our society.</span>

                  <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:44</span>):  The COVID-19 crisis has had a disproportionate impact on women. First of all, women in the workforce are more likely to be engaged in insecure work, the kinds of jobs that were the first to be lost as a result of the restrictions that were put in place. On average, more women than men are losing their jobs or having hours of work reduced. Women also take on a disproportionate share of caring and household duties and are spending one extra hour per day on unpaid housework and four hours on caring for children. Women are also far more likely than men to be the victims of domestic and family violence, which has markedly increased as a result of the lockdown measures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, women are more likely to be engaged in insecure work, yet 1.1 million casual workers are not covered by the government's JobKeeper scheme because they have been with their current employer for less than 12 months. Women retire with average superannuation balances half those of male retirees—a situation which will no doubt be made worse through the early access to superannuation scheme. Younger workers who access $20,000 of superannuation early could be costing themselves hundreds of thousands of dollars by the time they retire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As if the situation for women wasn't bad enough, the Morrison government has just kicked 120,000 early childhood educators off JobKeeper earlier than anybody else. What makes this decision even more outrageous is that Mr Morrison promised on Friday that JobKeeper would remain in place for eligible workers until September. The announcement that workers in early childhood education and care would no longer have access to JobKeeper from 13 July came only three days after that. It took just three days for Mr Morrison to break his promise to early childhood educators. The consequences of this decision are far reaching, especially for women. It will impact on workers, on parents, on the economy, and, worst of all, on children. This decision threatens the viability of a number of early childhood education services and puts at risk the jobs of educators. When women are already disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, it beggars belief that the first industry to be removed from the JobKeeper scheme is one in which 96 per cent of the workers are women, or maybe that's why it's happened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Free child care was a big help to parents who were experiencing the loss of household income through the economic impacts of COVID-19, especially given Australia has some of the most expensive, out-of-pocket childcare expenses in the world. Many Australian families were already struggling with high childcare fees before the pandemic. Now, during a recession in which 2.6 million Australians are unemployed or underemployed, paying for child care is beyond the means of many more. Australian families, early childhood educators and the Australian economy cannot afford a snapback to the old, complex, confusing and expensive childcare system. Snapping back to the old system three months early is going to make it more difficult for families relying on child care to balance the budget and to get back to work again as the economy recovers. This is a situation that will not just put financial pressures on family but will put a dampener on workforce participation and slow the economic recovery. And, once again, women, parents and carers will be impacted more than men.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If children are removed from child care or their hours are cut back, this is also going to have consequences for their educational development. As a former early childhood educator, I understand this. I get this. I know how important this is. This is why we refer to early childhood education as 'education' and not just 'care'. You need to think of early childhood education as a form of learning, like school but possibly even more vital for childhood development. Its importance has been verified by numerous studies. This is why early childhood education needs to be affordable and accessible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from studies the enormous contribution that early childhood education can have to the physical, psychological, social and emotional development of children. That's why developed nations are investing heavily in early learning and many of them are streets ahead of Australia. And I have to say that I was completely gobsmacked during yesterday's debate on the motion to take note of answers to questions without notice. The comments of Senator Rennick, who suggested in that debate that parents should just stay at home and raise their children, showed exactly what that side of the chamber think about child care and early childhood education. Not only was Senator Rennick actively discouraging parents from engaging in the workforce but he was dismissing the enormous value of quality early learning, and he was also presuming that everyone can afford to stay home and mind their child or children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I heard Senator Rennick's contribution, as I said, in the taking note debate, I actually thought that maybe we'd been transported back to the 1950s. It was particularly galling to hear early childhood education referred to as:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the hand of government reaching in and taking away our children's youth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Rennick gave a very bizarre speech yesterday in the taking note. I've been here for 12 years or so and I really think it was one of the most bizarre ones I've heard. I'm not sure if Senator Rennick, who referred to the Wizard of Oz, realises that the Wizard of Oz is a fiction which actually came to fruition in the late 1930s, but he sounded like he wanted to go back that far. He was insulting and he made outrageous slurs against the thousands of early childhood educators who uphold the highest professional standards and deliver high-quality early learning to children in their care. What message are Senator Rennick's comments sending to parents—particularly women—who want or need to participate in the workforce? How dare he suggest that these parents are complicit in taking away the youth of their children?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These backward-thinking comments must be rebuked by the government in the strongest terms but, of course, Liberal members and senators have been completely silent on them. I'd be very interested to hear what the Minister for Women, Senator Payne, has to say about these comments and whether she agrees with them; or the Minister for Education, Mr Tehan, in the other place; or his portfolio representative in this place, Senator Birmingham. Those opposite must disassociate themselves from Senator Rennick's comments or else, by their silence, they implicitly endorse his slur against early childhood educators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's okay for Senator Rennick to take four years off: what a wonderful man he was—he took four years off, I think he said, to look after his own children. I don't find that at all strange, if you can afford it. I don't know why he thought that he shouldn't, in actual fact, because we do understand that in these days of equality fathers should have equal access to caring for their children. He wasn't babysitting them; he was their father, and one would expect that a father who could afford to do it maybe would. But not everybody can afford it. Not everybody goes to work because they just like to go to work. Many, many people—especially women and especially those women in low-paid work, often casual work—go to work because they have to, to pay the bills. It's not because they can afford not to—</span>

The boys club and its 1950s attitudes was clearly voiced by Senator Rennick yesterday. This goes a long way towards—</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="273828" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUGHES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:55</span>):  At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the childcare sector was on the brink of collapse with large-scale withdrawals of children from child care. On 6 April the government put in place a temporary childcare package because the sector was facing unprecedented challenges. The Morrison government was quick to respond. It introduced a temporary childcare relief package to ensure that childcare services were available for essential workers. This is because we were committed to ensuring that the sector remained viable and that, importantly, childcare centres would still be available after the pandemic. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The childcare relief package was an outstanding success, and an early review demonstrated how successful it was, with 99 per cent of the 13,400 services operational as of 8 May. I should repeat that figure for the Labor detractors who have nothing better to do than tear down the work the Morrison government is doing to support Australians—99 per cent of services remained viable thanks to the Morrison government's relief package. A second survey showed that child attendance levels increased to 74 per cent in the week of 11 May, with families and businesses reporting an increase in demand as people began to return to work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has been responsive to the childcare sector. We've listened to parents who've told us they want childcare places and services expanded to offer more care. And we're continuing to invest in children as well as workers and parents in the sector as a whole. Just yesterday, on 10 June, the Ballarat<span style="font-style:italic;"> Courier</span> reported that there was such a demand for child care that one centre had a waiting list of 30 families and they receive daily inquiries about the availability of childcare. So much so, the centre is building another facility 2.5 kilometres down the road. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, what is the next step? Well, because of Australia's success at flattening the COVID-19 curve, our life and economy are starting to return to normal. The temporary childcare package, which includes free child care, will end on 12 July. But we are not abandoning this important sector. We're not abandoning the children, the parents or the workers; nor are we abandoning the childcare centre owners. We're replacing one type of support with another type of support. And, importantly, it includes a safety net for the families that need it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From 13 July, the government will continue to support families by providing more than $8.3 billion a year through the childcare subsidy to help parents with childcare costs. We'll provide about $2 billion for childcare subsidies in the coming quarter. Why? Because our children are important. And we'll continue to support Australian parents. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government will also provide support to childcare businesses in addition to paying the childcare subsidy with a transition payment of 25 per cent of fee revenue in the reference period. This will also be paid from 13 July. The childcare subsidy for parents is means-tested to ensure that those parents who earn the least will receive the highest level of subsidy. As a family's income decreases, the amount of subsidy they receive increases to the point where 85 per cent of their childcare fees are covered. It's good news for families because, as their income decreases, they will pay less out of pocket for child care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the childcare subsidy, out-of-pocket costs were less than $5 per hour per child for the parents of more than 70 per cent of children in centre based day care in the September quarter last year. Out-of-pocket costs were less than $2 per hour per child for the parents of around a quarter of all children in centre based day care. After close to two years, our childcare package still has lower out-of-pocket costs—3.2 per cent lower than they were two years ago. The Early Learning and Care Council of Australia has welcomed the transition package and confirmed that it will support childcare centres to remain open for more children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The childcare package has a record of supporting increased activity amongst women, whether it be working, training, studying or volunteering. In fact, in November an Aruma survey of parents found that our childcare package had increased activity levels for women by seven per cent. The number of women reporting more than 48 hours of activity in a fortnight rose from 56 per cent prior to the introduction of the package to 63 per cent in November last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're introducing a fee cap as part of the transition package that commences on 13 July. It will support families that struggle with their fees by requiring childcare services to cap fees until 27 September. Our government will also ease the activity test until 4 October to support eligible families whose employment has been impacted as a result of COVID-19. These families will receive up to 100 hours of subsidised care per fortnight. This will assist parents to return to the level of work, study or training that they were undertaking prior to COVID-19 and ensure continuity of care for their kids. For example, if a parent who was working full time in February is today working part time because of a reduction in available shifts, the family is eligible for 100 hours of subsidised care per fortnight. And because their family income has been reduced, they will receive a higher rate of subsidy for the days their children are in care. They will receive more child care and they will pay less for their child care this coming quarter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you're looking for more evidence that we're getting it right, the Early Learning and Care Council of Australia has said that the childcare subsidy activity test will mean that those impacted by COVID-19 will be more able to access and afford early education. We're calling on families who are experiencing reduced hours of activity or reduced income to update their details so that they do receive a higher subsidy rate than they were previously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The childcare package has a generous safety net that's designed to provide higher subsidies to families who are experiencing financial difficulty. The additional childcare subsidy is available for families who are under temporary financial hardship and provides increased childcare fee assistance to those families who are under financial stress. A loss of income, loss of employment or inability to pay childcare fees are just some examples of circumstances for which families may be eligible for this support. Eligible families can receive free care for the maximum 100 hours per fortnight. The additional childcare subsidy is also available for families who are transitioning to work. For example, families on jobseeker would be eligible for a subsidy of 95 per cent up to the hourly rate capped fee. This would mean that a family might be paying 60c per hour for care where the service charges a fee of $12 per hour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How successful have we been in addressing challenges that parents are facing? Well, the Australian Childcare Alliance president, Paul Mondo, has said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We would like to wholeheartedly thank Minister Tehan, the Treasurer and the. Prime Minister for listening to our members and recognising the importance of ensuring that all Australian families have access to high-quality learning services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is more evidence that we are supporting Australian families and businesses with fair and equitable support during the transition back to business as usual. Our transition package ensures that government support is accessible to every childcare service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are continuing to look after childcare workers. In a sector with approximately 200,000 employees, around 120,000 employees have been receiving JobKeeper payments. Our new transitional package will reach the additional 80,000 workers, most of whom are women. When we are replacing one type of support package with another type of support package, it's important to look at the combination of packages. From 12 July, childcare services would receive approximately $2 billion in childcare subsidy and $708 million in transition payments, along with the means-tested parent contributions. JobKeeper will cease for the childcare sector from 20 July, and the employment guarantee with the transition package will be in place from 13 July. When Labor says we're turning our backs on this sector, I can only suggest that they need to do more homework. It's not just the organisations that represent childcare businesses that have praised the Morrison government's response; the praise has also come from business owners. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we should also look at the Labor government's record when they were last in office. Childcare fees increased by more than 53 per cent and their compliance record was woeful. They did fewer than 500 checks and failed to cancel or suspend a single service, while our record is 3,900 important compliance checks, with 317 cancelled and 34 suspended services. Simply put, we care enough about this sector to pay attention.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:05</span>):  What I read is that childcare costs in a normal year are approximately $8.3 billion or about $2.07 billion over a three-month period. Now, I'm the older generation. I admit that. I had my kids in the seventies and eighties. I had four kids. At that period of time, I was a single mum. Did I have child care? No. Our responsibility was, if we had the kids, we looked after the kids. If you couldn't, grandparents looked after the kids. I worked part time, so I really did need that help. But it was my responsibility. I brought the children into the world. They were my responsibility. That was the older generation. You worked together as a family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But now it seems that the government just wants to open up, and it's happened. Both sides of parliament are behind the vote. You're encouraging people out there to have kids and saying, if they're lower socioeconomically and can't support their own children, they can rely on the taxpayer or the tax dollars given to them. Then, on top of that, you're saying: 'You don't have to look after your kids. We will allow you to put them into a childcare centre. That's not your responsibility.' That's why the cost is coming to $8.3 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard Senator Carol Brown's comments today that it's unaffordable for families, particularly women. Well, that in itself says a lot. I know a lot of men who have responsibility for their children as well and it is a huge cost to them. What we need an investigation into is the childcare centres and what they actually charge. I know that childcare centres charge on a holiday. They still get paid their money. On a holiday, they are still getting paid what it would cost to put those children in. The cost to families is outrageous. Some centres in Victoria are charging $150 a day. In Tasmania you're looking at $90 a day. It is terribly unaffordable. We've allowed it to escalate to that point where these childcare centres are making a fortune out of it because the federal government is picking up the bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want there to be free enterprise and people to take on their own responsibilities then they should be paying for their child care more so than the taxpayer. Taxpayers are footing the bill. You want to increase what we're paying out. Gonski is $22 billion, the NDIS is another $23 billion, you want the subs at $90 billion and here you want to put more money in, which could blow out to $15 billion a year. I want to know who's going to pay for this, because—I tell you what—the taxpayers out there have had a gutful of picking up the bill for all these people who are actually not facing their responsibilities. So I will say it: you can get a helping hand when you need it, but people have to start taking responsibility for their own actions. If you bring children into the world, they're your responsibility.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:08</span>):  This government continues to make balls-up after balls-up in its terrible response to the COVID-19 crisis economically. It consistently misjudges and does not understand the financial and economic situation that people find themselves in, day after day, in the midst of this pandemic. We see that the education minister, Dan Tehan, announced that the government thinks it's justifiable to return to full fees because participation in early childhood and care has now returned to 74 per cent across the board. That is a ridiculous premise on which to base this policy. That is a return to 74 per cent of previous participation in a system that had free fees. So you're now about to return a system that has 74 per cent participation based on free fees and use that to justify a return to a full-fee-paying system?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia already has one of the most expensive childcare systems in the world. Families were already telling us, in response to the government's so-called new childcare package, that the system was too expensive and that they could barely afford it before the pandemic and now you're asking them to return to these fee structures in an environment where many households have lost income and jobs. In fact, many of those households that will be struggling with these fee increases have had dramatic drops in income.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government made a complete balls-up again of the interim arrangements. We saw some childcare centres that were forced to offer free child care—for example, in the family day care sector—have absolutely no way of meeting their basic expenses to cover the costs of that care. Why? Because they weren't eligible for things like JobKeeper. It was patently ridiculous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw other examples in the north-west of Western Australia. Skilled people still in employment were unable to get child care because the government had offered free child care and again the centres couldn't afford to open because they couldn't meet their expenses under the government's free childcare model. As a result, working families who were prepared to pay fees couldn't even get a place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of thinking intelligently about how you respond to the needs of centres, the needs of working families and, most importantly, the needs of children, the government has just announced snapback to a system that is intrinsically not built for the current post-COVID circumstances. In an environment where women's working opportunities are more challenged because they were the first to be casualised, you are now asking them to undertake an activity test to be eligible for a couple of days of week child care. If you've lost work, you have to look for work two days a week. That sounds fair enough until you put on the table the complexities of what it's like to look for work when you're trying to organise your life around child care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does it mean if you're suddenly offered a full-time job and you can secure only two days? Many families would like to say: 'I'm looking for a full-time job. That's my commitment. My child is three. They're going to school soon. If we get organised, we can do three days a week and I can move up to four days. We can get our child ready to make that transition.' In many cases you can't just say: 'I'm doing my two days while I'm looking for a job. Now I want a full-time place because I've found a full-time job.' This government is simply not listening to the needs of families in our nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:13</span>):  First of all I would like to acknowledge Playgroup Australia. Playgroup Australia is a volunteer organisation whose vision is to create a village through play, by supporting and connecting parents and their children. Both my wife and I when we stayed at home volunteered at Playgroup Australia. It is an excellent way to interact with other parents. I'd also like to acknowledge the stay-at-home parents. They make an important contribution to early learning and help our teachers, especially in primary schools. Whilst at Playgroup I learnt that a lot of mothers and fathers actually wanted to stay at home with their children for as long as possible.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator RENNICK:</span>
                  </a>  Yes, I'm getting there. This idea that it's good to rush parents back into the workforce isn't always the view expressed by all parents. Many do want to go back to work eventually, but not until later in their children's life. I'm committed to giving parents as much choice as possible as to when they go back to work. This is why the focus shouldn't be on getting parents back into the workforce but on making it financially easier for parents to have greater choice as to how they raise their children. So, if parents want to stay home longer, they can. But most of all it should be about the welfare of the children. It's important that our children don't get left behind in today's rat-race—not that Labor care about the welfare of the child; we know that because there's nothing in this MPI that mentions the welfare of the child. Not once today have I heard any Labor speaker mention the welfare of the child. They're just interested in subsidies so they can deduct union fees from them. All they care about is collecting money to fund their re-election campaigns. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to give a speech this morning on the Paid Parental Leave Amendment (Flexibility Measures) Bill 2020, which would give mothers more choice about going back to work. I was shocked to be heckled by Senator Watt about such an important issue. Can you believe this? He was mocking me for speaking on a bill that was going to help mothers stay home with their children for longer. Women go through a lot to bring our children into the world: nine months of pregnancy, followed by childbirth and breastfeeding. It takes a huge toll and some women aren't always physically or emotionally ready to go straight back to work, especially if there is more than one child to look after—not that Labor would care about the welfare of the mother; they just want to clip the ticket. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think that being a member of the Queensland Labor Party, a party that has closed down over 30 maternity wards in regional Queensland, Senator Watt would show mothers a bit more respect. Do you know why it's so important that children stay at home with their parents? Because no-one can give their children the self-belief they so desperately need like their own mum and dad. As I said in my first speech, there is no substitute for mum and dad. And, of course, we must teach them respect, because, can I tell you, Labor and their left wing institutions won't. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You've only got to look at Twitter to see how the Left think. It's characterised by hatred, blaming, self-loathing, virtue-signalling and, of course, the modern day equivalent of bullying: the pile-on. There is no respect whatsoever. It is pure 1920s communism. Let me tell you that Lenin's useful idiots are not the role model that the Australian people want for their children. They want them to be strong and independent, and the best way to achieve this is to ensure that mum and dad are allowed to make the right choices for their families. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Trade and investment are essential to Australia's economy. Tens of thousands of Australian businesses, from sole traders to large enterprises, export goods and services around the world.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Investment has underpinned the growth of many Australian industries and enables businesses to expand, diversify, hire more staff, and enter new markets.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This inquiry considered opportunities for Australian businesses to increase their exports and attract further investment. In particular, the Committee examined what role the Australian Government has in boosting exports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee also considered what challenges businesses face when exporting, such as non-tariff barriers and unnecessary or burdensome regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This report makes 20 recommendations aimed at supporting businesses, including in new and emerging industries, to increase their trade and attract investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee recommended an assessment of the regulatory arrangements for the agricultural industry. This included recommending an examination of whether regulatory costs, red and green tape, and differing arrangements across jurisdictions are impacting on Australia's international competitiveness for agriculture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Another focus of the Committee's recommendations was supporting innovation and new and emerging industries, such as the space sector, defence exports, international health and video game development.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee also looked to the future of Australian trade and investment, including the Government's goal of having 90 per cent of Australia's two-way trade covered by trade agreements by 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Achieving this goal will be a significant milestone, but also raises the question of what further opportunities there will be to drive growth in Australia's exports.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As this inquiry process was coming to a close, the world was confronted with the COVID-19/coronavirus pandemic. This has already had devastating consequences for individuals, businesses and economies around the world. The long-term economic impact of COVID-19 is not yet known, but the Australian Government is putting measures in place to support businesses after this health crisis has been overcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As the majority of evidence to this inquiry was received before the COVID-19 outbreak, the report does not reflect the emerging challenges businesses across the globe will face as a consequence. However, the report recommendations, which focus on creating more opportunities to export and invest, remain relevant and necessary as the economy looks towards recovery in the coming months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On behalf of the Committee, I would like to acknowledge the difficult times many Australian businesses are experiencing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is our hope that the work of the Australian Parliament, including through this Committee, will help businesses recover from the effects of this pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to thank the individuals, businesses, organisations and government agencies who participated in this inquiry and provided the committee with an insight into the trade and investment challenges and opportunities for Australian businesses. I would also like to thank my Committee colleagues for their significant contribution to this inquiry and the ongoing work of the Committee more broadly.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Today I am introducing the National Skills Commissioner Bill to establish the statutory position of the National Skills Commissioner (Commissioner). The Commissioner will be a critical new part of Australia's economic infrastructure, providing independent expert advice and national leadership on the Australian labour market, current and future skills needs, and workforce development issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Vocational Education and Training (VET) system is the engine room of Australia's future growth. It is the place where every year, over four million Australians go to learn new skills, gain nationally recognised qualifications and springboard to their first, or their next job. It is the place that employers turn to ensure their employees receive high quality training, to enable them to do their existing jobs better or to perform new roles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Now, more than ever before, Australia needs the training system to be the best it ever has been. Australia's economy is changing rapidly and millions of Australians need to reskill and upskill in growth areas. It will be the Australian people, our human capital, that will lead Australia's recovery from the COVID‑19 health and economic crisis, supported by our world class VET system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill I am introducing today will create a new independent National Skills Commissioner who will lead thinking on Australia's skills and workforce needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commissioner will consolidate and strengthen labour market and skills needs analysis, to provide an independent and trusted source of information about what is happening in the Australian labour market now and into the future. This research and analysis will draw on emerging data sources and cutting-edge analytic techniques to ensure Australia's labour market analysis capability is world leading. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This analysis will help close skills gaps and provide confidence to employers, students, tertiary educators and Australian governments that we are investing in the right skills at the right time. This is essential to prepare Australians for the workforce opportunities of today and tomorrow. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Commissioner will examine the cost drivers and develop and maintain a set of efficient prices for VET courses, to improve transparency, consistency and accessibility for students. Currently, VET prices and subsidies vary considerably around Australia, with students paying different prices for the same course, and facing varying levels of quality. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I emphasise that an efficient price does not mean the lowest price. At the core of any purchasing decision, is a decision about value for money and VET is no different. In establishing efficient prices, the National Skills Commissioner will consider both the cost of delivering the qualification and the outcomes for the student. If the price for a course is higher, but that course consistently delivers students who are employed quickly with higher salaries, then it is safe to say it is value for money. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Central to the Commissioner's work will be a focus on quality, to determine the price that delivers the skills that employers need and sets students up for a valuable career. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, the Commissioner will lead research and analysis to examine the effectiveness of the VET system and advise on the public and private returns on government investment. This means better understanding VET student outcomes, such as whether a student got a job and what they are now earning, as well as public benefits such as building a strong care workforce. This will enable Australian governments to direct investment towards high quality courses that give students the best chance of getting a job, while strengthening our economy and society. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The COVID-19 pandemic has raised the importance and increased the urgency of this work, reinforcing the importance of our existing commitment to reform the VET system. It builds on our $585 million <span style="font-style:italic;">Delivering Skills for Today and Tomorrow</span> skills package, and contributes to COAG's agreed vision for VET to be a responsive, dynamic and trusted sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Together with the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2020</span>, this Bill delivers some of the key elements of the 2019 expert review of Australia's VET system, led by the Honourable Steven Joyce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The role of the National Skills Commissioner is underpinned by the principles of independence, transparency and accountability. It will support a stronger, more agile VET system, enabling us to navigate economic recovery, lift productivity and lay the foundations for a prosperous future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I commend this Bill to the chamber.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="241710" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DEAN SMITH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:20</span>):  I rise to make a contribution late this afternoon to the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment (Enhancing Australia's Anti-Doping Capability) Bill 2019. As we know, Australians love their sport. It's a love shared across the world, with sport estimated to account for as much as six per cent of world trade. And, just as we expect our international trade to be conducted fairly based on globally accepted principles and governance, our involvement in competitive sport is regulated by international standards also. Australia has agreed to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's International Convention against Doping in Sport because we support the principles of the World Anti-Doping Code.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation before the Senate today will improve our compliance with these principles and assist ASADA to adopt and harmonise its functions to combat the complex and evolving nature of doping in sport. The bill implements many of the recommendations of the 2017 Review of Australia's Sports Integrity Arrangements, known as the Wood review. Disturbingly, according to the explanatory memorandum for this bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Wood Review found doping is more prevalent and widespread than ever among athletes at all levels, and is facilitated by the increasing availability of highly sophisticated techniques that make it harder to detect.  The Wood Review also found serious and organised crime is involved in the supply of performance and image enhancing drugs and the current suite of statutory protections and powers under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Act 2006</span> (ASADA Act) is not sufficient to facilitate ASADA's increasing emphasis on intelligence-based investigations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians watching their favourite elite sports men and women expect their performance to have been developed through tireless training or natural talent. They do not expect to see athletes who have deliberately flouted rules on performance-enhancing techniques unfairly competing against those who have done the right thing. Australians hate cheating, something the Australian cricket team knows only too well, and doping is cheating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is committed to addressing the problem of drugs in sport to ensure that community expectations regarding the conduct of our elite sportspeople are met and exceeded. As stated again in the explanatory memorandum:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Wood Review made a number of recommendations including legislative amendments, principally to the ASADA Act, to allow ASADA's existing regulatory functions to be carried out more effectively. These amendments provide for these recommendations, with the principal effects to include:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These legislative changes are vital to ensuring Australians can feel confident about the integrity of their favourite sports and sports men and women.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">ASADA noted that in four significant cases in recent years, the inability to reach the reasonable belief threshold had delayed or otherwise prevented the progression of those matters, noting that in each of these cases the subjects of the investigations were facilitators, suppliers or third party enablers of doping.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, in response to questions taken on notice at the Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry, ASADA estimated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… that there are at least 10 instances of organisations or businesses being involved in the supply of performance and image enhancing drugs that ASADA has been unable to fully investigate using disclosure notices due to the current reasonable belief threshold.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This evidence underscores the importance of changing the threshold to combat the prevalence of doping in sport. While this change has concerned some, the Department of Health more than justified the necessity of this modern approach in its evidence to the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Acting on a hunch is not reasonable. As set out in the explanatory memorandum, reasonable suspicion is a threshold used for issuing search warrants in many jurisdictions in Australia. Search warrants authorise, amongst other things, the forced entry onto premises and the seizure of items. The Department of Health went on to explain that, while reasonable belief is appropriate when ASADA is able to rely on adverse analytical findings following the testing of urine and blood samples, this alone is increasingly ineffective in confronting doping.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Disappointingly, but perhaps not surprisingly, the Australian Greens presented a dissenting report as part of the community affairs committee process. I'll briefly make some comments on their findings on this issue. Recommendation 1 of the dissenting report is largely based on commentary presented in the Parliamentary Library's <span style="font-style:italic;">Bill</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Digest</span>. This digest references comments made by the head of the Australian Olympic Committee in an article from an Australian newspaper in 2006. We are, of course, debating amendments to a bill in 2020. Yes, 2006! The dissenting report extensively quotes from pages 28 and 29 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bills Digest</span> but deliberately excludes the following statement: 'However, the Australian Olympic Committee does not oppose the proposed amendments.' In politics, language is important, and the way this is phrased does not do justice to the Australian Olympic Committee's public position on the government's proposed amendments. And their public position is easy to find. The Australian Olympic Committee made a submission to the community affairs inquiry that the Greens could have quoted from to provide a more accurate description of their view. The submission's executive summary clearly states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Olympic Committee … welcomes the introduction of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment (Enhancing Australia's Anti-Doping Capability) Bill 2019—</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is paramount to the protection of clean athletes in an increasingly complex sporting environment that anti-doping authorities have the necessary powers to investigate allegations of doping violations. The Australian Olympic Committee is supportive of all proposed amendments to the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Act 2006 and the ability of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority to carry out intelligence based investigations. The Australian Olympic Committee, in its justification for its support of these amendments tonight, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Without this protection, we cannot preserve the integrity and honesty of Australian sport for all clean athletes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens' dissenting report goes on to question why ASADA and the government have allowed individual sporting codes to implement contracts compelling sporting participants to cooperate with ASADA. These are individual contracts between elite sports people and individual national sporting organisations. If individual organisations such as the Olympic committee, which provided a copy of their Tokyo Olympic contract to the community affairs committee, feel that their elite participants should answer any questions about doping then surely it is appropriate for them to ensure this occurs through contractual arrangements. These contractual arrangements help protect the national sporting organisation from damaging doping allegations, demonstrating to participants and spectators that the use of drugs in sports is inexcusable. It's perfectly reasonable that someone who has competed while representing our nation must comply and assist with any ASADA investigation. This inspires public confidence in sport and at the Olympic level protects our natural national reputation, meaning that an Australian who wins a gold medal, an Australian who wins a silver medal and an Australian who wins a bronze medal have done so in full confidence that they've done it fairly, openly and that that is a victory worthy of clean competition and reward at the Olympic level. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The dissenting report comprised six recommendations, but does not acknowledge the problems identified by the Wood review or provide any alternatives to address these serious issues of integrity in sport. The reality, as highlighted by the evidence to the committee, is that if no changes are made to ASADA's current processes they will continue to have difficulties investigating doping cases. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To conclude, I note the following from the community affairs report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recognises that the matters addressed in the bill have been the subject of extensive review and consultation, both through the Wood Review, legislative scrutiny processes and subsequently following the introduction of similar form of the bill during the previous parliament. The committee notes the refinements to the bill in response to this scrutiny and consultation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report goes on to summarise that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill seeks to enhance ASADA's intelligence gathering capabilities by addressing inefficiencies, inconsistencies and gaps identified by the Wood Review. At the same time, the bill is intended to provide ASADA with the flexibility it needs to apply a more risk based and nuanced approach to its work. Oversight is maintained through internal ASADA procedures as well as through judicial review, while appropriate safeguards remain in place for the protection of information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are important changes to ensure the integrity of sporting codes and national sporting representatives. The Wood review has identified the need for legislative changes, and the government is delivering on these recommendations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sport is a vital element of our Australian culture, and the community expects their sporting heroes to be free from performance-enhancing drugs and free from the allegation of the use of performance-enhancing drugs. The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment (Enhancing Australia's Anti-Doping Capability) Bill 2019 will enhance community confidence and ensure that our elite athletes are at peak performance due to their own efforts and skill, not because of performance-enhancing drugs and treatment. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:32</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment (Enhancing Australia's Anti-Doping Capability) Bill 2019. As chair of the Senate's Standing Legislation Committee on Community Affairs, I'm very pleased to make a contribution in relation to this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 17 September 2019 the House of Representatives introduced the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment (Enhancing Australia's Anti-Doping Capability) Bill 2019 to parliament. It was referred to the Senate's standing legislation committee on 28 November, and the committee tabled its report on 24 February this year. The bill was introduced to the Senate on 5 December last year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to improve the ability of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority, ASADA, to perform its functions within an environment both here in Australia and internationally, where doping has become increasingly more complex and sophisticated in recent times. This bill implements recommendations from the report of the review of Australia's sports integrity arrangements, which is also known as the Wood review. This review was conducted in 2017 and chaired by the Hon. James Wood AO, QC, as part of the Australian government's work to develop a comprehensive national sport plan. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wood review report was delivered to the then Minister for Sport in March 2018 and published on 1 August 2018. The Wood review has been the most comprehensive examination of sports integrity arrangements ever undertaken in Australia, if not the world. It found sports are tested by a range of growing integrity threats. Such threats include doping; sports wagering throughout the world, particularly through illegal online gambling markets; organised crime infiltrating and exploiting the sports sector; corruption in sports administration; and growing participant protection issues which include the sexual abuse of minors in sporting environments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we heard in September last year, when this chamber debated the National Sports Tribunal Bill 2019, the creation of a National Sports Tribunal was one of the key recommendations that stemmed from the Wood review. This review was conducted in response to the integrity of sport being threatened from all corners of the globe. The Wood review recognised that a fair, safe and strong sport sector that is free from corruption is something highly valued in Australia, particularly by the sporting organisations and the 14 million Australians who participate in sport annually.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now more than ever, as we start to come out of the social-distancing restrictions that were required over the past few months to stop the spread of coronavirus, the value of sport has been elevated even further. Sporting participants, organisations and viewers have been eagerly waiting for sports to be deemed safe again. In the coming weeks we'll see participants joining sports at all levels and renewing their desire to be part of such activities, including the AFL tonight. However, there is no place in these activities for doping, and we deserve to protect ourselves from threats to the integrity of our much-loved sports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In examining doping, the Wood review found that this practice was more prevalent and widespread than ever among athletes at all levels. In addition, the review found that doping in sport was enabled by the increasing availability of highly sophisticated techniques that make it harder to detect. Doping is becoming harder to detect by urine and blood sample analysis alone; we need intelligence and investigations to detect doping incidents and programs. Organised crime is involved in the supply of performance- and image-enhancing drugs, the review found, with statutory protections and powers under the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Act 2006—the ASADA Act—not sufficient for the increasing need for intelligence based investigations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This review showed that something needed to be done to clean up sport in Australia. The Wood review made a number of recommendations, including making amendments to the ASADA Act, to allow the authority's regulatory functions to be carried out more effectively. These amendments include streamlining the administrative phase of the statutory anti-doping rule violation process; extending statutory protection against civil actions to cover other persons in their exercise of anti-doping rule violation functions; facilitating better information sharing between ASADA and national sporting organisations through improving statutory protections for information provided to ASADA; and strengthening ASADA's disclosure notice regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the major recommendations of the Wood review is to amend the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Act 2006 and the Australian Sports Commission Act 1989 to abolish the Anti-Doping Rule Violation Panel. The anti-doping rule violation process was noted in the reviews as being overly bureaucratic, inefficient and cumbersome, and one of the most complicated of any country in the world. This bureaucratic process was confusing for anyone facing a violation allegation. Additionally, some of the steps in the process were duplicated, which led to delays in final determinations for those hearings. The proposed amendments in this bill seek to speed up this convoluted process while still allowing the athlete and relevant supporting body a fair hearing. The relevant amendment will remove the Anti-Doping Rule Violation Panel from the process, giving full responsibility to the ASADA chief executive officer to manage. While these amendments remove a participant's right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the participant would still have recourse against any decision handed down by ASADA through their ability to seek judicial review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed simplified anti-doping rule violation process will take the following form: the ASADA CEO will review evidence and determine if there has been a possible violation. After the CEO determines there has been a possible violation, the person is notified and invited to provide a submission within 10 days. The ASADA CEO will review the submission and if they still think a possible violation has occurred they will notify the relevant person and supporting body and make a recommendation to the sporting body as to the consequences of the assertion. The person may then accept or contest the infraction in a tribunal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Anti-Doping Rule Violation Panel was intended to provide independent oversight of the violation process. However, submissions to the Wood review from national sporting organisations and from ASADA itself stated that the panel's involvement was time-consuming, overly complicated and duplicated procedures, thus creating inefficiencies in the process. Article 8 of the World Anti-Doping Code requires that the rights and obligations of athletes or support persons to be determined by hearing bodies. The National Sports Tribunal, which was established in March this year, will serve as a hearing body for the purposes of article 8 for a significant number of athletes and support persons. The tribunal will ensure that members of the Australian sporting community have access to an efficient, effective, transparent and independent specialist tribunal for the fair hearing and resolution of sporting disputes. The tribunal can require witnesses to attend an interview, answer questions, give information and produce documents, but will not be subject to direction from any party so there is assurance that anyone appearing before it will receive an impartial and independent hearing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that the proposed amendments maintain Australia's ongoing commitment under article 3(a) of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization International Convention Against Doping in Sport to adopt appropriate measures at the national and international levels that are consistent with the principles of the World Anti-Doping Code.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ASADA was established in 2006 with a statutory investigations function, but the organisation had no ability to compel people to cooperate with its hearings. ASADA investigators could only request people to attend an interview, but they could decline the request or agree to attend an interview and then not show up. There was no recourse to compel them to appear. In addition, there was evidence that doping violations were being organised by people who were not subject to antidoping policies of one sport or another, so the sporting authority could not use its contractual powers to require these people to cooperate with antidoping investigations. The 2013 amendments were intended to address these problems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wood review found that for ASADA to effectively execute its intelligence and investigative functions the right to claim privilege against self-incrimination should be excluded. In the past ASADA relied on the cooperation of national sporting organisations to require athletes and other relevant people to answer questions, but the proposed amendment means ASADA will not have to rely on cooperation through private contracts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, doping violations, allegedly committed by an athlete or a support person, are often facilitated by a third person who is not bound by the terms of a sport's antidoping policy. ASADA could issue such a person with a disclosure notice requiring them to attend an interview to answer questions, but has no ability to require them to answer questions or to answer them truthfully. Under the proposed amendments, answers, information or documents given by someone under a disclosure notice will not be admissible in any proceedings other than those proceedings in connection with the ASADA Act or the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Regulations 2006. This provision presents a reasonable and proportionate safeguard on the use of the information obtained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to state here that a disclosure notice cannot be issued to a medical practitioner unless the ASADA CEO believes that the medical practitioner is involved in a possible violation of antidoping rules. This limitation recognises the confidential nature of the doctor-patient relationship and the need to prevent arbitrary inferences with that relationship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also seeks to amend the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Act 2006 to extend protection for ASADA and national sporting organisations and their staff against civil actions when exercising antidoping rule violation functions. This protects ASADA and national sporting organisations in their role when presenting evidence or material against an athlete or support person at a hearing, issuing an infraction notice or making recommendations about a provisional suspension.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wood review identified that, under the sporting administration body rules, sporting organisations are required to perform similar antidoping rule violation functions to ASADA. The ASADA Act protects the ASADA CEO, the body's staff and engaged personnel from civil action in their role of performing such functions, but the sporting organisations and their staff do not have the same level of statutory protection against civil action when performing similar functions. Antidoping matters are becoming more complex so the role of these organisations is an integral part of the investigative process. However, a lack of protection has presented a potential barrier for the participation of these organisations in such investigations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The extension of the immunity is a reflection of the fact that a sport may be required to do things as a result of ASADA's exercise of its legislative functions. For example, consider a situation where the ASADA CEO advises a sporting organisation that there is evidence an athlete has committed a violation. The organisation suspends that athlete, pending a hearing by a sports tribunal, and the tribunal finds the evidence is not sufficient to prove a violation. The sporting organisation could be exposed to civil action for the suspension. Under the amendments the organisation would be protected against such action.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government has always supported a fair, safe and healthy environment for athletes. We're committed to providing an environment for clean sport to flourish. Sport not only provides the physical activity our body needs, but the mental and social benefits are widespread too. Doping is a major threat to the health and wellbeing of our athletes, but also a threat to our sporting way of life, because it sullies all the good that sport provides within our society. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Liberal member for Bennelong and tennis player John Alexander OAM spoke on this bill in December last year in the House of Representatives. As a former professional sportsperson, Mr Alexander knows the value of sport. He also knows the value Australians place on sport. He explained when speaking:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australians don't just expect our sports people to win; they expect them to do so fairly and within the rules. Where they don't do this, we expect them to face the music.</span>

Australia continues to be at the front of the fight against doping in sport. To ensure that we remain there, Australia's antidoping capability needs to be enhanced. We need to streamline the antidoping violation rule process and reinvest those efficiencies back into ASADA and sporting organisations to enhance intelligence, investigations capability and, importantly, educational resources to support athletes across all sports and at all levels.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:49</span>):  The opposition opposes items 43 and 44 in schedule 1 in the following terms:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(1) Schedule 1, items 43 and 44, page 11 (lines 3 to 6), <span style="font-weight:bold;">to be opposed</span>.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment relates to items 43 and 44 of this bill in its current form, which seek to lower the threshold for the issuing of a disclosure notice from 'reasonable belief' to 'reasonable suspicion'. That would be a very significant change to the status quo and have a significant impact on athletes' individual rights. Currently, the ASADA CEO can issue a disclosure notice only if they reasonably believe that a person has information that may be relevant to the administration of the National Anti-Doping scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes proposed in items 43 and 44 were among concerns raised with the opposition by stakeholders and identified by both the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. Labor has sought to work with stakeholders to address this issue and initiated a Senate referral of this bill to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee for an inquiry earlier this year to give stakeholders the chance to detail their concerns with this bill. Through that engagement, we decided to move an amendment to the bill that would retain the current threshold of 'reasonable belief'. Key stakeholders, including the Australian Athletes' Alliance, have told us that the amendment would address their most significant concerns with the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The lower threshold proposed by this bill in its current form departs from the Attorney-General's guide to framing offences, which says that the document disclosure provisions should, firstly, impose a threshold of 'reasonable grounds to believe' that a person has custody or control of documents, information or knowledge which would assist the administration of the legislative scheme and, secondly, give a person 14 days to comply with the notice. In contrast, in relation to antidoping matters, this bill proposes, firstly, a threshold of 'reasonable suspicion' that the person has information, documents or things that may be relevant to the administration of the NAD scheme and, secondly, no limit to the period that the ASADA CEO may specify in the notice. Where draft provisions depart from the guide, the Attorney-General's Department website instructs departments to consult with the criminal law division of the AGD before proceeding. The explanatory memorandum of this bill is silent as to whether there has been any consultation with the AGD.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The explanatory memorandum suggests that some jurisdictions allow search warrants to be issued at a threshold of 'suspicion' and that the nature of the disclosure notice is less intrusive because it does not permit entry into premises. However, that analogy is flawed, because the disclosure notices in the context of antidoping investigations can also compel a person to attend for questioning. In other contexts, a person can generally be compelled to attend for questioning only if a court issues a warrant for their arrest or if a person, usually a police officer, arrests them without a warrant. The general requirement for the issuing of a warrant or for arrest without a warrant is that the person issuing the warrant or making the arrest believes on reasonable grounds that the person has committed or is committing an offence. These issues are summarised very clearly in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bills Digest</span> for this bill. The section of the digest dealing with these issues wraps up by saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In light of the broad responsibilities of the ASADA CEO and the width of the phrase 'relevant to the administration of the NAD scheme', there is some doubt whether a change to the threshold for issue of a disclosure notice is necessary. It may be sufficient for the ASADA CEO to fully utilise the current legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This would not have the same flow-on impact in relation to other measures in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor takes the integrity of Australian sports extremely seriously. We understand and support the need for Australian defences against sports integrity threats to be updated as the nature of those threats evolve, and we recognise that the bill, for the most part, seeks to implement recommendations from the Wood Review of Australia's Sports Integrity Arrangements. Labor is committed to continuing to work constructively with all stakeholders to ensure that Australian sport is well protected against these threats. The establishment of Sport Integrity Australia and the National Sports Tribunal, which Labor supported in the parliament, are important steps. Labor believes stronger antidoping measures can be achieved while maintaining the current disclosure notice threshold and would support the bill as amended if the Senate sees fit to support Labor's amendment.</span>

We're pleased that the disclosure threshold hasn't been lowered, and we believe these other amendments would improve the bill significantly. They, I think, would allow a strengthening of the anti-doping framework without compromising the fundamental rights of athletes, including the right not to self-incriminate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AOL" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COLBECK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians and Minister for Youth and Sport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  I have just a couple of quick comments on the Greens amendments, which the government won't be supporting. I will just put a couple of points on the record in the context of that position. With respect to retaining access to the AAT, which is one of the provisions that the Greens are looking for, the government does agree that it is right that there is an appeal process for anti-doping decisions. That is why the government has established the National Sports Tribunal, which has commenced its operations. So there is a process for athletes to make an appeal. They also do retain access to both the Federal Court and also the Commonwealth Ombudsman. So there are processes that can be obtained by athletes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens also made some comments with respect to cost. There is some provision within the National Sports Tribunal process for the CEO to assist in that circumstance, although employing your own lawyers will obviously come at some cost to anyone involved in those processes. So we won't be supporting the Greens amendment in that context.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some discussions in the Greens amendments with respect to access to documentation. The processes proposed within the bill don't actually prevent athletes or parties having access to documents; it's basically about the time and place and availability of those documents. So we're not removing the right to access information and documents as part of the way that the legislation works. For example, information or documents may not physically be in the possession of the CEO of ASADA—or Sport Integrity Australia, as it will become—at the time. So, it's about determining a time when they are able to be produced. We agree that parties should have access to appropriate documentation. This is about organising and determining a time and place for those elements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the points that the Greens raised with respect to self-incrimination: given that these are civil proceedings, not criminal proceedings, there is a difference in how the right to self-incrimination does or does not apply. The common law right to self-incrimination does not apply in civil proceedings in the same way that it does in only criminal matters. So, there is a difference there, and proceedings under this act are civil provisions, not criminal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the really important points that I think has been raised by a couple of colleagues in the debate is the capacity to deal with third parties, not necessarily contracted parties. If we consider the circumstance of some of the most infamous events in recent times with respect to doping, some of those parties have not been subject to any aspects of our antidoping process, because the antidoping process does not have reach. It's important that the facilitators of doping can be captured as a part of our antidoping process, and we think that's a really important change in the way our antidoping system operates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've made some comments about the importance of the National Sports Tribunal. We think that's an important addition to the overall framework of sport integrity in Australia. It's designed to be cost-effective for athletes and to provide support to athletes as part of that process. I've already mentioned the fact that the CEO of the National Sports Tribunal has an obligation to provide support to athletes, including through the establishment and maintenance of a free legal advice panel. So, there are ways for athletes to get access to support at reasonable cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens also, in their amendments, talk about the opportunities for the establishment of a specific athlete ombudsman. The World Anti-Doping Agency, WADA, has formed a working group to examine that concept. The government would like to wait for that working group to report back. It's not something we can completely rule out, but we want to make sure that Australia remains compliant with the World Anti-Doping Agency code, and we will refer the outcomes of the deliberation of the WADA working group to the soon-to-be-formed Sport Integrity Australia Advisory Council on how to proceed. So, that provision that the Greens are seeking through their amendments is not completely shut off. It's something we'll consider as that piece of work continues through the World Anti-Doping Agency process. I would note in that sense, though, that athletes do retain access to the Commonwealth Ombudsman.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:06</span>):  I rise to speak on the Commonwealth Registers Bill 2019 and the four related bills being considered together as a package by the Senate this evening. Together these bills are for an act relating to a government registry regime and for related purposes; an act to amend the law relating to corporations, business names, registration and consumer credit and to deal with consequential measures relating to the enactment of the Commonwealth Registers Act 2019; an act to amend the Business Names Registration (Fees) Act; an act to amend the Corporations (Fees) Act; and an act to amend the National Consumer Credit Protection (Fees) Act 2009. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Taken together, these bills have two primary aims. They create a new Commonwealth business registries regime which will allow ASIC and other business registers to be updated to provide a more user-friendly and streamlined registry service. They also introduce a new director identification number which will make it compulsory for company directors to provide proof of identification before registering their companies. This will improve the ability of regulators to combat illegal phoenixing, which costs the Australian economy billions of dollars every year and causes enormous pain to the people affected within the supply chain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has led the advocacy for both of these reforms and we will support this bill. I am pleased that these bills have been brought before the Senate. For many years, Labor and our allies in the community have been raising the issue of illegal phoenixing, but very little has happened. The senate inquiry led by Doug Cameron reported in December 2015, making a recommendation about director identification numbers. Nearly five years ago that Senate committee concluded its work, having taken evidence about the harm that was being done by illegal phoenixing, yet only now are any practical measures being brought before the Senate. But delay is a consistent theme with this do-nothing government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After receiving the banking royal commission final report, Prime Minister Morrison and Treasurer Frydenberg took six months—not to do anything, but to release an implementation timetable. One year after the report was on their desks, the government had only completed six out of the 76 recommendations made by Commissioner Hayne. Now the government has announced a further delay. We are calling for the royal commission implementation delays to be limited to no more than six months. It's pretty reasonable under the circumstances. We acknowledge the role that the banks are playing in the crisis. We support a strong banking system and the recent measures that have added needed liquidity and financial support during COVID-19. But the Australian public rightly have an expectation that these recommendations will be implemented. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government cannot continually delay important and essential reforms, like the implementation of the commission's recommendation, in the same way that it has delayed these reforms associated with business registries modernisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally disturbing is the delay in reforms to payday lending. One of the bills before us is an act to amend the National Consumer Credit Protection (Fees) Act 2009. Labor has consistently advocated for greater protection for consumers in these areas, in response to ongoing concerns about improper behaviour. We've backed up our advocacy with action. In government we enacted the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009, and that created a national regime for the regulation of consumer credit for the first time. In 2012 we made further enhancements, including additional protections regarding small amount credit contracts and consumer leases. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the sound groundwork laid in this area, once again the government has failed to act in a timely way, and it has neglected the other reforms that are necessary to enhance protections for consumers under this act. The government started a review of the small amount credit contract sector in August 2014, at about the same time that the Senate inquiry into phoenixing was wrapping up its work. It was the same year, incidentally, that it started the wheels turning on a business registers modernisation regime. In 2017 the exposure draft on payday lending was released, and after a three-month consultation period that all wrapped up in November 2017. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, despite having the legislation ready to go and the exposure draft in place, nothing has happened. So, with Senator Griff late last year, I introduced the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Small Amount Credit Contract and Consumer Lease Reforms) Bill 2019. And we've introduced it here as a private senator's bill, a bill that, embarrassingly, seeks to legislate the government's own legislation that it has been sitting on for years. With the support of Senator Griff we've been working through the provisions of that act and an inquiry on the bill in the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. I look forward to that committee reporting and I'm confident it will add to the body of evidence about the need for enhanced consumer protection here. But, if the government had any idea what was going on in the community, they wouldn't need an inquiry and they wouldn't need additional evidence; they would have acted. But, typically, in this area, as in so many other areas, all we get is delay. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we turn to the modernisation of business registers. Well, our business registers are in need of modernisation. Currently they operate on severely outdated and inefficient information technology infrastructure. This infrastructure has not evolved with changes in technology or with the needs of business over time. And again the story here is delay. The government first committed to modernising business registers back in 2016. Back then, it was part of an attractively named 'national business simplification initiative'. The intention of that initiative was to reduce the time businesses spent interacting with government so they could get on with the business of keeping the economy moving. Well, in its most recent budget update, the 2019-20 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, only $60 million was allocated to the project. This is a big project. As we've been told time and time again in estimates when we've asked about it, it's a very complex project. The scope is substantial. But the government's track record in implementing infotech projects is really, really poor. The government needs to ensure and provide some guarantees in this place that it is going to invest what is necessary to complete this project successfully. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, director identification numbers have been on foot for a long time. They're important. The implementation of legal frameworks for director identification numbers will provide a unique identifier for directors of Australian companies and it will provide traceability for those directors over time. Labor has advocated this for a very long time. Without Labor's work on this issue, the Liberals would continue to allow fraudsters to rip off small businesses and their employees. Every year, illegal phoenixing costs Australian workers and businesses billions of dollars. It sees company directors strip businesses of their assets when times get tough, not pay their debts to workers, and then vanish completely, only to start a new business later on. And in many cases directors do this numerous times. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2018, a report by PwC estimated that the annual direct cost of phoenix activity to the Australian economy could be between $2.9 billion and $5.1 billion, and this includes up to $3.2 billion worth of unpaid invoices for services provided and up to $300 million of unpaid entitlements for Australian workers. I return again to the fact that these issues were canvassed extensively by a Senate inquiry spearheaded by my friend Senator Doug Cameron. This place is only now coming to grips with the recommendations made in that report about director identification numbers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have long urged the government to act on illegal phoenixing. We commend the government for finally getting around to doing something. We will support this legislation. We encourage the government to implement their long-overdue measures as soon as possible and to properly resource their implementation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:15</span>):  Mr Acting Deputy President McGrath, I know you're a pretty funky guy, so you're going to be very interested in what I've got to say. Elvis Presley and Bob Marley are alive and well and are in the Australian business registry. Indeed, they are registered as company directors in Australia, as are Homer Simpson and many other colourful characters. The point I'm making is that the reforms in the Commonwealth Registers Bill 2019 and related bills are long overdue. We have a system that is all about easy registration but has never been about identity checking. ASIC have not pulled the wool over anyone's eyes in this respect. They have been totally open and honest that the system was set up to allow easy registration online with no verification, no authentication at all as to who is being registered as a company director in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are quite a few interesting aspects to the changes here. I want to make a quick comment in the few minutes I have tonight before we go to the adjournment debate. ASIC made it very clear that the process to change the business registrations online for company directors has been underway for nearly 16 years. For 16 years it has been talked about by parliamentary committees. For 16 years it has been discussed at Senate estimates. For 16 years it has been raised by parliamentarians. I point out to Senator McAllister that it's not just the coalition government that hasn't acted on this. If what ASIC have said is true, this has been going on for a very long time. The Phoenix Taskforce brought together stakeholders like ASIC, the Federal Police, AUSTRAC and the Australian Taxation Office. When that taskforce looked at this issue, there was finally enough momentum to get to the point where we have some legislation before us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 2.7 million company directors listed in this registry. I'm sure many of them are genuine, but we know for a fact that many of them aren't. It has been well reported by the ABC, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> and other media outlets that vulnerable people have been approached and been paid to register as company directors for front groups for dodgy companies, especially companies that go into liquidation without paying their PAYG tax. This has been going on for some time, and I suspect that ASIC are very glad to be passing to the ATO this registry and the whole process of modernising this registry. There are very few regulators anywhere in the world that also look after the business registry. In fact, I think Mr Shipton said that there were only two other countries in the world where the regulators are responsible for maintaining the registry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is important because we are going to get a much more robust and authentic system for establishing company director IDs, by issuing a number with an authentication process. That number will be with company directors for life, so you can't just re-register for each business you may be wanting to set up. That number will stay with you for life. That is going to occur at the same time that the registry modernisation project is underway. I believe that the ATO is a good place to have the registry. There are a number of other initiatives that the Greens have been pushing for years in order to get much better transparency in place to avoid illegal and unethical behaviour—phoenixing being just one example.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this has been a 16-year journey. We know it's going to make a difference to the real problems we have dealt with in committees. There is a whole range of misconduct, particularly around liquidation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Finance, Charities and Electoral Matters</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  During times of crisis Australians, of course, come together. I want to take the opportunity to pay tribute to some of the local heroes here in Canberra who have done great things during the COVID crisis. People right around the nation have been doing great things, but I want to honour some great Canberrans. I want to draw the Senate's attention to some outstanding Canberrans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge Dr Toby Angstmann. He is a doctor and the founder of the Canberra distillery Underground Spirits. For several years Toby and the team at Underground Spirits have produced some of the finest gin and vodka in the country. When COVID-19 restrictions saw the closure of pubs and clubs, Underground Spirits switched to producing hand sanitiser. They produced more than 40,000 litres, which was distributed to doctors, nurses, paramedics, pharmacists, dentists and to those most in need. Among the customers were those on the frontline at Services Australia, who faced the serious prospect of being unable to open their offices up and down the east coast of our country. Underground Spirits were able to supply 12,000 litres of hand sanitiser within 24 hours to enable Centrelink offices to continue their work. I commend Toby and his entire team for the work they've done and continue to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Underground Spirits are not alone in changing rapidly from the production of alcohol for consumption to hand sanitiser. I want to recognise Unicorn Spirits, Big River Distilling, The Canberra Distillery and Capital Brewing Co as well for their excellent work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's Glenn Keys and his excellent team at Aspen Medical. Aspen Medical is a Canberra based company that has more than 200 Canberra based staff. They've been working to deliver pop-up emergency departments and additional testing facilities not just here in Canberra but right around the country—a really important part of our response in dealing with this health crisis and part of the insurance policy if those numbers were to grow significantly, which, thankfully, to date have not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to recognise John and Lyn Anderson, the owners of Federation Square, a small shopping centre precinct in Gold Creek Village. John and Lynn consider their tenants family, and when times get tough family members pull together to make sure everyone gets through, so that's exactly what John and Lyn did. In an extraordinary demonstration of the Australian spirit, John and Lynn told each of their 30 tenants that they wouldn't need to pay rent at all for the month of April—very generous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also Tamara Ryan, who set up the Canberra Region Coronavirus Mutual Aid Facebook group in order to connect those in need with those who can lend a hand. Members help others with grocery runs and supplying essential goods to those unable to do so for themselves or to those socially isolating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen people at the Australian National University—my old uni and the greatest in Australia on the latest rankings—in their own homes come together to crash print batches of face shields for frontline health workers to ensure they got the PPE they needed when there may have been shortages. And it has been good to see that, despite everything, the Turner RUC has been continuing with a virtual meat raffle on Fridays. Well done to the team there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course there are also the unsung heroes with the COVID-19 crisis. Like in other parts of the country, they're the supermarket workers putting in overtime to keep our shelves stocked—going above and beyond. They are the cleaners working to ensure that our workplaces and public transport are as safe as they possibly can be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to pay tribute to the Australian Public Service, many of whom are based here in Canberra. There are a lot of people in Australia who like to bash the Australian Public Service, and some of them come into this place from time to time, but I think it's fair to say—and I would say on behalf of Canberrans and on behalf of Australians more broadly—there has been some extraordinary work done during this crisis by some of our Australian public servants. That's whether it was frontline workers at Services Australia, who really geared up to make sure that people could get the payments they need; whether it was the Chief Medical Officer and other health officials; whether it was those in Treasury and Finance doing the economic response; or whether it was those in the department of industry, looking at some of those supply lines, and of course in the department of infrastructure; and in so many other areas—whether it was other frontline workers. To those Canberrans in particular I just wanted to say thank you tonight. I want to say thank you for your outstanding work, thank you for your service to our city and, for those going beyond, thank you for your service to our nation during this very difficult time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  One of the first Australian industries to be hit by the restrictions that came into place in response to the COVID-19 crisis was arts and entertainment. While the restrictions on public gatherings were vital in stopping the spread of coronavirus, sadly, they also put a stop to the many events which the arts and entertainment industry relies on for much of its income. Museums, galleries, theatres, live music venues and TV and movie production sets were closed, and concerts, festivals and exhibitions were cancelled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has led to an uncertain future for many of Australia's 50,000 professional artists and the 600,000 workers who support them. While the JobKeeper wage subsidy scheme has helped some artists and arts organisations, many are ineligible despite having lost 100 per cent of their revenue. This is why Labor has been calling, and continues to call, for a targeted and tailored package of support for the arts and entertainment industry. That package needs to be developed in consultation with the industry, and it needs to be substantial enough to make a real difference. Targeted support for the arts and entertainment sector from the government so far includes a $27 million support package; $7 million for Indigenous arts; $10 million to the charity Support Act; and $5 million for a relief and recovery fund. When you add these initiatives up, that's just shy of $50 million. This financial support is welcome, but it's a drop in the ocean for a $111 billion industry which has lost about a quarter of its workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Live Performance Australia estimates that its segment of the industry alone needs $850 million in support to get through the crisis. That's more than 15 times what Mr Morrison's government is offering the entire industry. Just to give some context: this government gave $100 million in support to zoos. That support was no doubt necessary and welcome, but when a major industry receives half as much funding as that going to zoos it really calls the government's priorities into question. For those who know the history of the government's treatment of the arts, it should come as no surprise that they would abandon the industry in a time of need. People in the arts industry have long memories. They remember that those opposite cut nearly $90 million from the arts in their horror 2014 budget and withdrew $105 million from the independent Australia Council in 2015 and directed it to the Catalyst slush fund. To add insult to injury, they axed the federal arts department in December 2019.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's screen industry is facing a crisis because the government has suspended key local content quotas for new Australian drama, documentary and children's programs. In early April this year, when the last round of Australia Council grants were announced, 49 small to medium organisations lost their funding. This included several in my home state of Tasmania, such as Tasdance, Kickstart Arts, the Salamanca Arts Centre and AustralianPlays. Some of these organisations have lost a large chunk of their revenue and are now facing an uncertain future. For Tasdance, it has put a damper on next year's celebration of their 40th anniversary, and the cut to the digital publishing services of AustralianPlays has national implications for the ability of playwrights throughout Australia to earn a living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal's history of neglect and even apparent contempt for this industry clearly demonstrates that those opposite are not friends of the arts. But we on this side of the chamber understand the value of arts. We know that Australia owes it to the arts industry to help them through the crisis. Throughout the pandemic, they've given us the means, while confined in our homes, of keeping our minds active and engaged—of allowing our imaginations to escape to the outside world. During this period of self-isolation many of us have found comfort in Australian books, music, films and television, and the arts industry has helped us through previous crises, including raising funds for relief during the recent fires. In my home state of Tasmania, the arts do much more than just provide entertainment. They underpin our $3 billion tourism industry with attractions like MONA and festivals like Ten Days on the Island and Dark Mofo, drawing visitors from around the world. And we must remember that there are many community arts organisations that run programs promoting mental health wellbeing and social inclusion through the arts. Surely, after discovering their $60 billion JobKeeper bungle, this government can afford to provide serious funding to an important Australian industry which is gasping for breath. I urge those opposite to come up with a serious plan to save the arts.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  I rise to speak on a very important manufacturing opportunity that we cannot—I repeat, we cannot—let slip by. ElectroNet and TransGrid are in the process of seeking approvals to build a 900-kilometre interconnector between Robertstown in South Australia and Wagga Wagga in New South Wales. It's a 330-kilovault above-ground transmission line with a transfer capacity of about 800 megawatts. It will help stabilise power and reduce electricity prices in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. It will also provide connection points along the way to tap into renewable projects which will be given the opportunity to connect to the grid through the interconnector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we do nothing, the steel for that 900-kilometre interconnector will come from overseas despite having ample ability in this country to build raw steel. Last year Centre Alliance lobbied the government, and the government—and I'm very appreciative of their support—provided Whyalla company Ferretti a $600,000 grant to look at the feasibility of actually building transmission towers here in Australia in Whyalla using steel from the Whyalla Steelworks. The feasibility study has been completed, and, basically, it stacks up: it is feasible for us to build transmission towers here in Australia at a competitive price. Not only that but it will create about 150 jobs in Whyalla. It will create $500 million in economic stimulus over eight years. It will also place greater demand on the Whyalla Steelworks to help the steelworks in their expansion efforts, making sure that we retain a steel capability here in this country. If you can't produce steel, you pretty much have to give up. It's necessary for manufacturing right across Australia. It's necessary for construction. It's necessary for the defence of this country in times of conflict. It's a strategic capability. So we need to support it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we were to have the plant in Whyalla that Ferretti is hoping to build, we would build a capability that value-adds, and that's exactly the sort of thing we need to be doing here in Australia post-COVID-19. There are huge opportunities. There's a 60-kilometre transmission line in the Pilbara that needs to be built. There's a Cultana to Port Lincoln powerline on the Eyre Peninsula to be built. There's Snowy 2.0, which will require transmission lines. And that's just to name a few. We want to have a situation where transmission lines across Australia are built from quality Australian steel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government needs to help make this happen. The government needs to impress upon the companies intending to build this interconnector that it must be Australian steel. You know what: we've got to stop just exporting rocks. We have to stop just exporting rocks. We need to be value-adding. Of course, when we build steel, we are value-adding. But we need to go up the value chain, and we need to be looking at building, in this instance, transmission towers. We need to get a commitment or have the government apply pressure through whatever means—and I will be writing to Minister Taylor about this next week—to make sure that this work goes to Ferretti in South Australia. That will make Whyalla a winner. That will make South Australia a winner. But it will also make Australia a winner, and that's what we must do.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="256063" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  I rise to address this chamber about very important Indigenous issues which have been profiled at large over the last week or so. I believe that one of the most important issues that faces our country is the disadvantage which has applied to Indigenous people for the last couple of hundred years in this country. When we look at the key stats and we hear about them regularly in this place. We do look at incarceration rates, we do look at mortality rates and we do look at the level of education attained. These are real bread-and-butter issues, which you'd have to say that for a country as wealthy and as successful as Australia we have not performed well on. In fact, I would say that we have failed Indigenous Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe the framework that was put forward in 2017, which is known as the Uluru statement, does offer some significant opportunities for us to address these issues in a structural way. The statement itself calls for structural reform. It does seek a voice for Indigenous Australians which would provide the capacity for Indigenous people to have a say on policies and laws which affect them, which I believe is a good and a fair idea. There is, of course, a component in the Uluru statement around truth telling, and the minister, Ken Wyatt, has said this week that that is an important component. We have seen statues pulled down in other countries. There is a discussion about pulling down statues in this country. I think it would be a huge mistake to try to rewrite our history. We should take this opportunity to be honest with ourselves about what has been good and what has been bad. Minister Wyatt himself, the first Indigenous person to occupy the position of Minister for Indigenous Australians, has said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">These statues should remain as a reminder of a point in time in our lives – even when detrimental. They serve as prompts to encourage people to talk about history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In schools today in Australia, people are told about our past. That is important, and that should continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The practical measures that I think we should continue working on include changing, with the agreement of the Indigenous communities, the Closing the Gap targets. Of course, there are very practical things that can happen at the local level. I've tried to spend the first year I've had in public office meeting with people in communities in my state of New South Wales in places like the Central Coast, Kempsey and Redfern, where there are large Indigenous communities, and asking them what is important to them. Often it is, especially in more remote parts of the state, the way that policing is done. There are significant changes, I think, which could improve relations and engagement between community and law enforcement. In places like Redfern, where there have been significant troubles going back with riots—even in the last few years—many of the elders today would say to me, 'We have broken down barriers between Indigenous groups and the police, and that has really improved things on the ground.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think comparisons between jurisdictions and countries are often unhelpful. I think that, in this case, the issues that we have in this country predate any of the activity over the last few weeks. We should own the mistakes and we should press on with this framework we've been given by the Indigenous community, which is this Uluru statement, as a practical way to address some of the challenges. My sense is that we should not fail in this task. If we were to fail on the commitments we've given Indigenous people, which have been enunciated very clearly and very well in the PM's Closing the Gap framework, then we would risk the cohesion of our country. So we can't afford to fail on Uluru. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I've seen more dinner times than I've seen dinners, I've known discrimination, I've known prejudice, I've known all of those things ... but some of that is still with us ... and it's got to be changed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  We all remember the horrific scenes last summer when bushfires tore through so much of our country. Thirty-three lives were lost. Thousands of homes were destroyed. Millions of hectares were burned, and it's estimated that one billion animals were killed. Sadly, for too many bushfire victims, the pain is ongoing several months on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week it was reported that only four per cent of people in bushfire affected areas have managed to access government support—four per cent. Ninety-six per cent of people have received nothing. One in 10 bushfire victims who applied for the government's disaster recovery payment has been rejected. One in three who applied for the disaster recovery allowance has been rejected. When you look at those figures, it's no wonder that so few people in bushfire affected regions have received the support that they need. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The disaster recovery assistance process has been slammed by individuals, farmers and small businesses as confusing, stressful and too complicated to navigate. These are people who have already been through bushfires, have literally feared for their lives, have lost property, have in some cases lost loved ones and now face a system of payments that is just too complicated to navigate, to the point where many give up. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've met so many of these people over the last few months in different parts of the country. After the last sitting week Senator Ayres and I travelled to Cobargo on the New South Wales South Coast and witnessed firsthand the trauma that is still being experienced by people and the lack of support they feel they are getting from this government. Even the coordinator of the National Bushfire Recovery Agency has admitted that there are significant problems. While giving evidence to the bushfire royal commission last week, Mr Colvin, the coordinator, acknowledged that to obtain support victims have to tell their horrific stories over and over again. He acknowledged that:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Every time they have to tell their story we are effectively retraumatising that individual. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why can't this government make the changes that are necessary to ensure that bushfire victims receive the support they deserve without being retraumatised? Is that really too much to ask when you think about what these people have been through? It doesn't have to be this way. For months Labor has been pointing out the need for case managers to help people navigate the grants process. Sadly, the government has not taken up this suggestion and it's bushfire victims who are the poorer for it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, quite apart from the issues around accessing grants and loans, we still have people living in tents, in caravans and in buses, including brave firefighters who put their own lives on the line to protect others. Now some of the places that these bushfires hit are some of the coldest parts of our country. We are now in winter, and people are still living in tents, caravans and buses waiting in some cases for their burnt-down homes to be removed so that they can just start rebuilding.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give you a couple of examples. Mr Roy Annesley survived severe burns to 55 per cent of his body and his house burnt down. He's now living in a bus fundraised by his son. Mr Annesley says:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I just can't do all the groundwork to try and do all of this stuff, I can't even do anything—I don't want to get out of bed in the morning.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree 100 per cent with Mr Annesley. He has been through a lot. He's living in a bus that his son had to fundraise for him. Should he really be expected to navigate an incredibly complicated grants process and tell his story over and over again to receive the support that he needs?</span>

Not long after it happened, there was a call from someone in the system saying that each person would be given a mentor to guide them through the process. I've had one phone call.' It is not good enough that these people have been forgotten. It is not good enough that we have a Prime Minister who promised these people immediate support and the minute the news cameras went they were forgotten. We've got to do better.</span>

                  <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on the irreplaceable loss of Juukan Gorge rock shelters in the Pilbara of Western Australia. These were wilfully destroyed. On Sunday 24 May, at the beginning of reconciliation week, Rio Tinto blasted the Juukan Gorge rock shelters to smithereens. The rock shelters showed 46,000 years worth of continual occupation and provided a 4,000-year-old genetic link to today's traditional owners. The Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikurra peoples, the traditional owners of this land that was blasted, did not want this heritage destroyed, but now it is gone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People around the world rightly condemned the destruction of ancient statues and sites by the Taliban and ISIS. What was blasted in the Pilbara in Western Australia is irreplaceable—46,000 years—and is rightly being condemned around the world. Rio Tinto knew the cultural significance of the site to the traditional owners. They even helped to make a documentary about it. They can't deny that this was wilful destruction of a heritage site. It is morally and ethically wrong. They did not have a social licence to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just Rio Tinto in my home state of Western Australia; unfortunately, we have a long and tragic issue and history of destroying First Nations cultural heritage in our country without the consent of the traditional owners. In fact, in Western Australia traditional owners, if they want to get some sort of compensation or payment, at a very early stage are being required to sign agreements which mean they cannot then complain. They are signing agreements before some of the archaeological work is done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a whole host of mining companies in WA, including BHP and Fortescue Metals Group. Quite frankly, they are taking advantage of the Aboriginal Heritage Act, the archaic heritage legislation in Western Australia, which over the decades mining companies in Western Australia have directly influenced to make sure it is weak and have weakened it when they didn't get their way and if they thought that First Nations heritage and culture would stand in their way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, of course, we heard that BHP was also granted permission. It's reported that, only days after the destruction wrought by Rio Tinto, they received permission to destroy between 40 and 70 significant First Nations sites in the central Pilbara. Fortunately, they have now called a halt to that potential destruction. I hope the next thing they do is pick up the phone to the traditional owners and say, 'Let's talk about which sites you want to make sure are protected.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is crystal clear that our state and federal laws are fundamentally flawed. They fundamentally fail to protect and preserve cultural and heritage values in Western Australia. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act has been a joke for years. My question is: why didn't the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in Western Australia take action? Why didn't the Minister for Indigenous Australians take action? Why didn't Minister Ley take action to stop this destruction? This has gone on too long. The clear message to mining companies is: you do not have a social licence to do this anymore. I say to state and federal governments: get your act together and fix these laws.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="ZN4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HENDERSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  I rise in this adjournment debate to place on the record in the Australian Senate my profound concern about the Victorian Labor government's treacherous decision to enter into a belt-and-road initiative agreement, or BRI, with the Chinese communist government. I say 'treacherous'—and that's a strong word—because that's exactly what it is. This agreement is not just contrary to the foreign policy of the Australian government; it's contrary to the national interest, including on national security grounds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 30 April, I was the first parliamentarian, state or federal, to call on Premier Daniel Andrews to cancel this agreement. Once again in this place I call on the Premier to rip it up and to put Victoria's interests ahead of China's. Today Prime Minister Morrison told Neil Mitchell on radio station 3AW that Daniel Andrews has done the wrong thing. He should admit it and he should withdraw Victoria today from the BRI. We have a mutual interest in making sure that we as a country sing with one voice when it comes to dealing with foreign nations and geopolitics. The Victorian Liberal-National opposition will axe this deal if elected in 2022, I am very pleased to report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week Premier Andrews made one of the most extraordinary statements in the Victorian parliament. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I would not agree with the notion that I might go to Beijing and provide a lecture on a whole range of these matters whilst at the same time encouraging the Chinese to buy Victorian products. I do not think that would be particularly conducive to more jobs or a stronger relationship. Now if that is the mission of those opposite—to actually sell less goods to less customers—well, we do not agree with that approach. And if the Leader of the Opposition wants to lead a human rights delegation to China or any other country and then try and do a trade deal at the same time, I wish him luck because I reckon he will need it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it very much appears that this belt-and-road agreement has bought the Premier's silence on issues as important as human rights in China, including the terrible situation in Hong Kong, with the imposition of Chinese security laws, and the detention of more than one million Uighur Muslims in so-called re-education camps or, more correctly, forced labour camps.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the irony of the Premier's human rights trade-off is that it has done nothing to deliver more exports to China. The shocking tariff hit on barley exports is in fact a breach of the BRI and, of course, will cause enormous damage to Victorian farmers. The BRI has also done nothing to stop the messages that we are receiving that have been delivered to Chinese students and Chinese tourists that Australia should be avoided. Of course, our government has very strongly rejected that notion. That's because the BRI is all about financing the Victorian government's projects in exchange for ensuring that Chinese companies and Chinese workers are given priority access to Victoria. This will hurt Victorian workers. But what's so concerning is that we have no details of these deals and the impact that this will have on the Victorian economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we grapple with the massive economic and health challenges of recovering from the coronavirus pandemic, our economic sovereignty has never been more important. Our trading relationship with China is incredibly important, but, as the Prime Minister says, we won't bow or trade away our values when it comes to being an open trading economy, including our position on our telecommunications networks, on foreign interference, on how we stand up on issues of human rights or on freedom of navigation. We won't avoid asking the hard questions, such as leading the charge on an international inquiry into the cause and spread of the coronavirus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake: the BRI is a foreign policy and economic strategy of the CCP designed to grow its power and influence across the globe. Even if Victoria can avoid debt-trap diplomacy, as has occurred in other parts of the world, there will be a price to pay. China's Belt and Road Initiative is the wrong road for Victoria, and it's a pity that Victorian federal Labor MPs, such as the member for Corangamite, do not have the guts to stand up to Daniel Andrews on this issue. They are happy to sell Victorian workers up the river, and I condemn this deal in the strongest possible terms.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  The government's scheme to allow emergency access to superannuation is perhaps one of the worst public policy decisions in their sordid history. The emergency access scheme has been a disaster. Some 1.63 million Australians have withdrawn a total of $12 billion from their accounts, encouraged by the government, doing tens of thousands of dollars damage to their future retirement incomes. Research from the firms AlphaBeta and illion has found that, rather than the scheme being a measure of last resort, 40 per cent of the people who applied for the scheme did not see their income drop over the course of the crisis. Sixty-four per cent of the money withdrawn went to entirely discretionary items. Eleven per cent of the emergency super release went straight into gambling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's haste in opening up workers' savings meant that they failed to consider that their program opened up the gates for organised crime. On the same day that the Australian tax office alerted the AFP to this fraud, the person who passes for the minister for superannuation claimed that the ATO has substantial checks in place to guard against fraud. Every Australian superannuation accountholder who has not checked their account should do it tomorrow. We have no idea of the real extent of fraud in this botched, ill-conceived, poorly executed catastrophe of a policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The harm already done by the government to super brings me to a senator for New South Wales, Senator Bragg. His first speech in the chamber included a call to make superannuation optional for low-income workers. That would have done immeasurable damage to the retirement incomes of women. I note that Senator Bragg has released an entire book critiquing the superannuation system. It's unwise to make predictions about the year 2020, but I predict this: it will be remaindered before the year is out, it won't be on anybody's Christmas book list, it won't be read on beaches across Australia and it will be lining budgie cages all over Woollahra. Even his mates won't be able to credibly pretend that they have read it. One dishonest claim made in that book deserves special attention, and it undermines any authority or credibility that he might have and the credibility of people who push the same argument that he does. Senator Bragg is so determined to paint the union movement as an illegitimate vested interest that he goes so far as to publish these lines:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Make no mistake, industry super funds are on track to be the biggest political donors in Australia. They'll be bigger than the CFMMEU and Co.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Except they're not, and Senator Bragg knows that they are not. He makes the claim over and over again. He's been provided with the returns from the Electoral Commission. The funds have written to him setting out the truth of the matter.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I saw him make this outrageous, baseless and pathetic claim, I asked for a search to be done to check. Industry super funds have made only two donations to the Labor Party in their history, a total of less than $25,000, mostly to attend events. They are a tiny fraction of a percentage of the donations that are made to political organisations. He knows this. He continues to make the claim. What do you call a claim that is repeatedly made where the maker of the claim knows it to be false, misleading and a dishonest attempt to pervert the public debate and to stigmatise honest people performing their work for not-for-profit funds dedicated only to building the retirement savings of their members? It is, of course, a lie. 'Lie' is not a big enough word to describe what Senator Bragg perpetuates in his book and what is perpetuated in all the breathless accounting in the newspaper of that book. He should withdraw it and he should not be taken seriously when he makes contributions to this debate.</span>
